item 1a.   risk factors risk factors; cautionary statement as to forward-looking statements the following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with teledyne. these factors could materially affect "forward-looking statements" (within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995) that we may make from time to time, including forward-looking statements contained in "item 1. business" and "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of this form 10-k and in teledyne's 2016 annual report to stockholders. it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, and new factors may emerge. additionally, management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on teledyne or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
a new global recession, continued economic uncertainty in europe or an economic downturn in china may adversely affect us.
if another global recession emerges, if economic uncertainty in europe continues or worsens, or if economic growth in china substantially slows, we may experience declines in revenues, profitability and cash flows from reduced orders, payment delays, collection difficulties, increased price pressures for our products, increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories or other factors caused by the economic problems of customers. if negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers' access to credit or render them insolvent, orders for our products may decrease, which would result in lower revenue. likewise, if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit, in selling their products, or otherwise in operating their businesses or remaining solvent, they may become unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products. these events could adversely impact our ability to manufacture affected products and could also result in reductions in our revenue, increased price competition, and increased operating costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
we develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets, domestic and international commercial aerospace markets, the semiconductor industry, the consumer electronics, telecommunications and automotive industries, each of which has been cyclical, exhibited rapid changes and suffered from fluctuating market demands. a cyclical downturn in these markets may materially affect future operating results. in 2015 and 2016, for example, our revenue and income were negatively impacted by the downturn in energy markets.
in addition, we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and in more mature industries that are sensitive to capacity. adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services, which may reduce our revenues, profits or production levels. for example, in 2014 several of our major customers reduced their marine seismic operations in connection with a general slowdown in the marine seismic exploration industry. some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical refining, which may be negatively impacted by reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity.
a material amount of our total revenues is derived from companies in the oil and gas industry, especially the offshore oil and gas industry, a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices.
a material amount of our total revenues is derived from customers in or connected to the oil and gas exploration, development and production, especially the offshore oil and gas industry. one of our largest commercial customers is in the offshore oil and gas industry and accounted for 2.3% and 2.8% of total sales in 2015 and 2014, respectively.  in 2016, no commercial customer in the offshore oil and gas industry accounted for more than 1% of total sales. the oil and gas industry is a historically cyclical industry characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities. in 2014 and again in 2015 and 2016, the price of brent crude oil experienced dramatic declines, from a high of $116 in june 2014, to a low of $27 in january 2016. oil and gas prices, and market expectations of potential changes in those prices, significantly affect the levels of those activities. worldwide political, economic and military events have contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. any prolonged reduction in the overall level of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations of our businesses within our instrumentation  segment.  some factors that have affected and are likely to continue affecting oil and gas prices and the level of demand for our services and products include the following:
•   worldwide demand for oil and gas;
•   general economic and business conditions and industry trends;
•   the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries, or opec, to set and maintain production levels;
•   the level of production by non-opec countries;
•   the ability of oil and gas companies to generate funds for capital expenditures;
13
•   domestic and foreign tax policy;
•   laws and governmental regulations that restrict exploration and development of oil and gas in various offshore jurisdictions;
•   laws and governmental regulation that restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing;
•   technological changes;
•   the political environment of oil-producing regions;
•   the price and availability of alternative fuels; and
•   climate change regulation that provide incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources.
teledyne manufactures seismic sources, interconnects and data acquisition products used in offshore energy exploration. when crude oil and natural gas prices are low, the level of marine seismic exploration activity typically decreases, potentially resulting in reduced demand for our products used in offshore energy exploration. in addition, a decline in the level of capital spending by oil and natural gas companies may result in a reduced pace of development of new energy reserves, which could adversely affect demand for our products related to energy production, and, in certain instances, result in the cancellation, modification or rescheduling of existing orders.
risks related to the proposed acquisition of e2v:
with the pending acquisition of e2v, the risk profile of teledyne may differ materially from prior years, which could materially change our results of operations.
on december 12, 2016, teledyne and e2v reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition to be made by teledyne for the ordinary share capital of e2v by means of a scheme of arrangement. at announcement, the aggregate enterprise value for the transaction is expected to be approximately £627.1 million (or approximately $788.9 million) taking into account e2v stock options and net debt. it is expected that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all relevant conditions, the acquisition will be completed in the first half of calendar 2017. e2v is a leading designer, developer and manufacturer of radio frequency ("rf") power systems, imaging solutions and semiconductors to the aerospace, security and defense, space, medical, scientific and industrial markets. e2v is headquartered in the united kingdom, with key operations in the united kingdom, france, the united states and spain.
as discussed below, while there are risks associated with acquisitions generally, including closing and integration risks, there are additional risks associated with owning and operating businesses internationally, including those arising from u.s. and foreign policy changes, political instability, and exchange rate fluctuations. with this acquisition, a greater percentage of teledyne's revenues and expenses will arise from international sources. the acquisition will also significantly expand teledyne's international employee base and manufacturing footprint. as a result of the acquisition of e2v, the financial results of the combined company will be more exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations and an increased proportion of assets, liabilities and earnings will be denominated in non-u.s. dollar currencies. the combined company will present its financial statements in u.s. dollars and will have a significant proportion of net assets, expenses and income in non-u.s. dollar currencies, primarily the british pound, the canadian dollar and the euro. the combined company's financial results and capital ratios will therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. a depreciation of non-u.s. dollar currencies relative to the u.s. dollar could have an adverse impact on the combined company's financial results.
while most of the products made and markets served by e2v are complementary to teledyne, the acquisition of e2v will expand the size of teledyne's digital imaging segment relative to its other segments. continued innovation and research and development efforts will be required to maintain e2v's leadership position in imaging products and semiconductor production. e2v's business also may be more capital intensive than many of teledyne's other businesses, increasing teledyne's capital requirements. approximately one quarter of e2v's revenue relates to long-term contracts, many of which involve advancements in technology and are fixed price. as discussed below, an inherent risk in fixed price contracts is that actual performance costs may exceed the projected costs on which the contracts are agreed. the failure to anticipate technical problems, estimate costs accurately or control costs during the performance of a fixed price contract can reduce its profitability or result in a loss.
14
we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition of e2v, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.  we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating the two businesses.
our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the pending acquisition of e2v will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate our business with e2v's business. combining two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. as a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of the company and e2v. the integration process may disrupt the combined business and, if implemented ineffectively, could preclude the realization of the full benefits of the acquisition that are currently expected. our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of e2v and teledyne and could adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and diversion of management's attention.
in addition, even if the operations of the businesses of the teledyne and e2v are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the proposed acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect, or the full benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two businesses. all of these factors could adversely affect our earnings, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the proposed acquisition, or negatively impact the price of our common stock. as a result, we cannot assure that the combination of teledyne's and e2v's businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the proposed acquisition.
in order to close the proposed acquisition of e2v, we will need to incur a significant level of debt that could have significant consequences for our business and any investment in our securities.
the proposed acquisition of e2v will be teledyne's largest acquisition to date. in connection with the announcement of the proposed acquisition, in december 2016, we entered into a £625.0 million bridge credit facility to fund the acquisition and related transaction costs, in order to meet the requirement under the u.k. city code on takeovers and mergers that we have sufficient and certain resources available to fund the consideration for the acquisition. in january 2017, we amended our revolving credit agreement to allow us to use that facility to fund part of the consideration in lieu of the bridge credit facility. we intend to use the proceeds of the term loans and the senior notes to fund the consideration and transaction costs for the proposed acquisition. the indebtedness we have incurred and expect to incur to fund the proposed acquisition could have significant consequences for our business and any investment in our common stock, including:
•   increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;
•   reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities and stock repurchases;
•   limiting our ability to making large acquisitions;
•   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.
the pending acquisition of e2v is subject to various closing conditions, as well as other uncertainties, and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed.  failure to consummate the proposed acquisition could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results.
the consummation of the proposed acquisition of e2v is subject to certain customary conditions. a number of the remaining conditions are not within our or e2v's control, and it is possible that such conditions may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the acquisition. at meetings held in january 2017, e2v shareholders voted in favor of the resolution to approve the scheme of arrangement and voted to pass a special resolution to approve the implementation of the scheme.  the waiting periods required under both the u.s. hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, and in respect of the e2v's u.s. state department's itar registration have expired.  clearance or expiration of the waiting period under german merger control laws remains outstanding.  after discussions with the german authorities, e2v and teledyne submitted a revised application for clearance on february 24, 2017 in respect of the acquisition.  the german authorities have one month to review such revised submission. clearance from the french ministry of economy and finance and the french ministry of defense in respect of the acquisition also remains outstanding.
15
under the u.k. city code on takeovers and mergers, we may in certain cases invoke a condition to the acquisition to cause the acquisition not to proceed only if the u.k. panel on takeovers and mergers, is satisfied that the circumstances giving rise to that condition not being satisfied are of material significance to the company in the context of the acquisition. because of this consent requirement, the conditions, may provide us less protection than the customary conditions in an offer for a u.s. domestic company. we therefore may be required to proceed with the acquisition in the event of a material adverse change at e2v.
we cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of the remaining required conditions will be satisfied or if another uncertainty may arise. if the proposed acquisition does not receive, or timely receive, the required regulatory approvals and clearances, or if another event occurs that delays or prevents the acquisition, such delay or failure to complete the acquisition and the acquisition process may cause uncertainty or other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and, to the extent that the current price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the acquisition will be completed, the price per share for our common stock could be negatively impacted.
we are subject to the risks associated with international sales and international operations, which could harm our business or results of operations.
during 2016, sales to international customers accounted for approximately 43% of our total revenues, compared with 44% in 2015 and 45% in 2014. in 2016, we sold products to customers in over 100 countries. in 2016, the top five countries for international sales were china, the united kingdom, germany, south korea and japan, constituting approximately 20% of our total sales. our acquisitions, including caris in 2016, bowtech products limited ("bowtech") and icm in 2015, bolt in 2014, reson in 2013, lecroy in 2012 and dalsa in 2011, contributed to greater international sales. as noted above, our pending acquisition of e2v will add to our international presence. we anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant and increasing percentage of our revenues, particularly since business and growth plans for many teledyne businesses focus on sales outside of the united states, including to emerging markets such as china, brazil and west africa.
risks associated with international sales include, but are not limited to:
•   political and economic instability;
•   international terrorism;
•   export controls, including u.s. export controls related to china, sanctions related to russia, and increased scrutiny of exports of marine instruments, digital imaging and other products;
•   changes in legal and regulatory requirements;
•   u.s. and foreign government policy changes affecting the markets for our products;
•   changes in tax laws and tariffs;
•   changes in u.s. - china and u.s. - russia relations;
•   difficulties in protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights;
•   transportation, including piracy in international waters; and
•   exchange rate fluctuations.
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position. given our several canada-based businesses, volatility in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the u.s. dollar, or other foreign currencies, could adversely affect the business, operations and the financial condition of our digital imaging segment.
in june 2016, the united kingdom ("u.k.") held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union ("e.u."), commonly referred to as "brexit." the announcement of brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. the announcement of brexit and the potential withdrawal of the u.k. from the e.u. may also create further global economic uncertainty, which may adversely impact the economies of the u.k., the e.u. countries and other nations, may cause our current and future customers to reduce their spending on our products and services, and may cause certain e.u.-based customers to source products from businesses based outside of the u.k. for example, brexit-related uncertainty could lead to a reconsideration by airbus as to future investment and spending in the u.k., which could reduce sales for our u.k.-based businesses that supply airbus. given our several u.k.-based businesses, including our pending acquisition of e2v, volatility in the value of the british pound relative to the u.s. dollar, or other foreign currencies, could increase the cost of raw materials and components for our u.k.-based businesses and could otherwise adversely affect the business, operations and the financial condition of our uk-based businesses.
16
sales of our products and services internationally are subject to u.s. and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to import-export control. violations of export control rules could result in the impositions of fines and penalties or the suspension of our ability to export items from one or more businesses or the entire corporation. depending on the scope of the suspension, this could have a material effect on our ability to perform certain international contracts. attempts by the new presidential administration to withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements, which were raised as a possibility in the 2016 presidential campaign, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
among other things, we are subject to the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa, which generally prohibits u.s. companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. further, in 2011, the united kingdom also implemented the u.k. bribery act, which increased the level of anti-bribery law enforcement and compliance relative to the fcpa. any determination that we had violated the fcpa, the u.k. bribery act, or equivalent anti-bribery and corruption laws in countries in which we do business could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. while we have procedures and compliance programs in place and conduct fcpa and other trainings, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from misconduct by our employees, agents or business partners.
our international operations are subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers, changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor regulations, differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war. we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur, or financial investments we hold.
acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
our growth strategy includes acquisitions. acquisitions involve various inherent risks, such as:
•   our ability to assess accurately the value, strengths, weaknesses, internal controls, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates;
•   the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business;
•   our ability to integrate acquired businesses and to achieve identified financial, operating and other synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition;
•   our ability to assess, integrate and implement internal controls of acquired businesses in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002;
•   the distraction of management resulting from the need to integrate acquired businesses;
•   increased competition for acquisition targets, which may increase acquisition costs;
•   the potential impairment of assets;
•   potential unknown liabilities associated with a business we acquire or in which we invest, including environmental liabilities;
•   the risks associated with acquiring privately-held companies, which generally do not have as formal or comprehensive internal controls and compliance systems in place as public companies;
•   production delays associated with consolidating acquired facilities and manufacturing operations;
•   risks associated with owning and operating businesses internationally, including those arising from u.s. and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations; and
•   unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business.
while we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection, including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues, such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition. further, indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters, particularly matters identified after a closing.
17
as they have over the last few years, acquisitions may also change the nature and level of various risks faced by teledyne. for example, our acquisition of bolt in 2014 increased our exposure to the offshore energy exploration market. the bolt acquisition, the dalsa acquisition in 2011 and the lecroy acquisition in 2012 increased the percentage of sales attributable to commercial customers as opposed to the u.s. government. as noted above, our pending acquisition of e2v increases our international presence and the percentage of sales related to the digital imaging segment. these acquisitions, coupled with our other recently acquired companies, located outside of the united states, also increased the percentage of revenues and expenses that arise from international sources and consequently our exposure to u.s. and foreign policy changes and exchange rate fluctuations. additionally, the businesses of e2v, dalsa and lecroy are more capital intensive than other teledyne businesses, which could result in increasing teledyne's capital requirements.
under sec rules, teledyne must issue a report on management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. the sec permits a limited time-based exclusion for acquisitions to give a company an opportunity to evaluate more fully the internal controls of acquired companies and correct deficiencies and institute new or additional internal controls. our 2016 management's report specifically excludes from its scope and coverage our 2016 acquisitions of caris, quantum data, frontline, in usa and hanson, allowing us additional time to evaluate existing internal controls and implement additional controls as appropriate. with regard to future acquisitions, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to these acquired companies or other acquisitions.
in connection with our acquisitions, including ones which we do not complete, we may incur significant transaction costs. we are required to expense, as incurred, such transaction costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our quarterly financial results. further, the acquisitions of u.s. public companies, such as bolt and lecroy, now routinely trigger purported class action lawsuits, filed by shareholders of the target companies, the defense of which has increased transaction costs, among other things.
changes in future business conditions could cause business investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets to become impaired, resulting in significant losses and write-downs that would reduce our operating income.
on january 1, 2017, teledyne's goodwill was $1,193.5 million and net acquired intangible assets were $234.6 million. under current accounting guidance, we are required to test annually both acquired goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment based upon a fair value approach, rather than amortizing them over time. we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in an entity's market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business, or other factors. if the fair market value is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, we could be required to record an impairment charge. the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows, discount rates and estimated product life cycles. in making these judgments, we evaluate the financial health of the business, including such factors as industry performance, changes in technology and operating cash flows. as we have grown through acquisitions, the amount of goodwill and net acquired intangible assets is a significant portion of our total assets. as a result, the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken. we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if, as a result of a change in strategy or other reason, we were to determine the value of other assets had been impaired.
united states and global responses to terrorism, continuing turmoil in middle eastern countries, concerns regarding nuclear proliferation and the safety of nuclear energy, potential epidemics, financial issues facing airlines and volatile energy prices increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
united states' and global responses to terrorism, continuing turmoil in middle eastern countries and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to u.s. and other business and financial markets and could adversely affect our business and operations.
air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts, as well as after the high-profile outbreaks of disease. while travel by our sales and service personnel to various regions has been affected by such factors, additional declines in air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and, in turn, could adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment. the 2015 paris terrorist attacks or the syrian refugee crisis could result in governments in europe imposing greater restrictions on the movement of personnel or goods, which could adversely impact our businesses located within the european union or our ability to sell products in that region. in addition, a prolonged virus epidemic or pandemic, or the threat thereof, could result in worker absences, lower productivity, voluntary closure of our offices and manufacturing
18
facilities, disruptions in our supply chain, travel restrictions on our employees, and other disruptions to our businesses. moreover, health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the temporary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities.
deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and in-flight communications equipment, which would adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics segment.
higher oil prices could adversely affect commercial airline-related customers of our aerospace and defense electronics segment. conversely, lower oil prices have decreased oil exploration and petrochemical refining activities and have hindered our marine and other instrumentation businesses. in addition, instability in the middle east or other oil-producing regions could adversely affect expansion plans of the oil and gas industry customers of our instrumentation and cable solutions businesses.
our revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks:
our revenue from u.s. government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the u.s. government, and, accordingly, we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be canceled or diverted to other uses or delayed.
we perform work on a number of contracts with the u.s. department of defense and other agencies and departments of the u.s. government including sub-contracts with government prime contractors. sales under contracts with the u.s. government as a whole, including sales under contracts with the u.s. department of defense, as prime contractor or subcontractor, represented approximately 27% of our total revenue in 2016, compared with 26% in 2015 and 25% in 2014. performance under government contracts has inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and the failure of congress to appropriate funds for programs in which we participate could negatively affect our results of operations. the u.s. government shutdown during 2013 negatively affected many of our businesses, and the failure by congress to approve future budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our products and services and cause us to lose future revenues. additionally, defense spending is expected to continue to decline in some areas over the next few years. a continued emphasis on federal deficit and debt reduction could lead to a further decrease in overall defense spending. the continued war on terrorism also could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which teledyne participates. budgetary concerns could result in future contracts being awarded more on price than on other competitive factors, and smaller defense budgets could result in government in-sourcing of programs and more intense competition on programs that are not in-sourced, which could result in lower revenues and profits.
the sequestration provision of the budget control act of 2011 originally imposed $500.0 billion of defense cuts over nine years starting in fiscal year 2013, which represented approximately 9% of planned defense funding over the period. on november 2, 2015, the bipartisan budget act of 2015 (the budget act) was signed into law. the budget act raises the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt (the debt ceiling) until march 2017 and raises the sequester caps imposed by the budget control act of 2011 by $80.0 billion, split equally between defense and domestic spending ($50.0 billion in government fiscal year 2016 and $30.0 billion in government fiscal year 2017). on december 18, 2015, congress passed and the president signed the consolidated appropriations act of 2016, which provides funding for the u.s. government for the government's 2016 fiscal year, providing $1.1 trillion in discretionary funding for federal agencies through september 2016. the president signed a continuing resolution in september 2016, which was extended in december 2016, and provides funding for the u.s. government at fiscal 2016 levels through april 28, 2017. congress has yet to pass a budget, although both chambers are moving forward with appropriations bills. the total statutory spending cap remains at $1.1 trillion as set by the relief authorized in 2016 and 2017 by the bipartisan budget act of 2015 to the original sequestration specified by the budget act of 2011, which set discretionary caps through 2021.
continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us, because not all of the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding. changes in policy and budget priorities by the president, his administration and the u.s. congress for various defense and nasa programs could continue to impact our engineered systems, aerospace and defense electronics and digital imaging segments. for example, changes in national space policy that affect nasa's budget have occurred. there have also been significant reductions in missile defense budgets. our engineered systems segment may be further impacted by delays in production runs under the jassm and harpoon missile programs, as well as u.s. department of defense directives to introduce competitive bidding for programs on which we have previously served as sole source. the president has expressed concern over the cost of the f-35 joint strike fighter program. our aerospace and defense electronics segment may be impacted by volume and/or price reductions in connection with this program, to the extent they are imposed. the timing of program cycles can affect our results of operations for a particular quarter or year, and cancellations of significant programs such as the objective simulation framework ("osf") or the shallow water combat submersible ("swcs") would affect our results. it is also not uncommon for the u.s.
19
department of defense to delay the timing of awards for major programs for six to twelve months. reductions and delays in research and development funding by the u.s. government may continue to impact our revenues. as darpa reviews its programs aimed to technologically enhance u.s. military capabilities and national security, changes to the darpa research and technology development programs in which we participate could occur. uncertainty over budgets or priorities with the new presidential administration could result in delays in funding, changes in funded programs and the timing of awards that could have a material impact on our revenues in 2017. finally, various u.s. department of defense initiatives, such as the emphasis on in-sourcing positions to the government and anticipated reductions or cancellations of existing programs, could negatively impact our engineered systems segment.
our participation in government programs may decrease or be subject to renegotiation as those programs evolve over time.
the u.s. government has been placing emphasis on small business quotas and increasing small business contract set asides and minimum work percentages. in some cases, prime contractors are required to reduce participation by large subcontractors like teledyne in order to fill small business quotas and be responsive to proposals and bids. as a result, our engineered systems segment could be significantly impacted.
over time, and for a variety of reasons, programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation. we have been a significant participant in nasa programs, primarily through our engineered systems segment and through teledyne scientific company. the prior administration introduced significant changes to the national space policy, including the cancellation of the nasa's constellation program which includes ares launch vehicles. teledyne brown engineering has developed the muses, an earth imaging platform, as part of our commercial space-based digital imaging business. the muses platform depends on continued operation of the iss, and we may not be successful in developing the technology or commercial relationships necessary to make this investment profitable. the launch of muses has been delayed due to several launch failures by space x, and is now scheduled for the summer of 2017. continued delays in launching muses could have adverse impact on the success of this platform. while most recently, in early 2014, we were awarded a five-year $60.0 million contract by nasa's marshall space flight center to develop and manufacture the launch vehicle stage adapter for the space launch system, failure to further transition our business successfully could result in reduced sales. in addition, delayed funding and changes in support for nasa's current space policy could negatively impact our business. the new presidential administration could also lead to changes to the nation's space policy, some or all of which could materially impact our results.
our contracts with the u.s. government are subject to termination rights that could adversely affect us.
most of our u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the u.s. government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor. termination for convenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses, and profit on work completed prior to termination. termination for default clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the u.s. government in re-procuring undelivered items from another source. we had one u.s. government contract terminated for convenience in 2016, compared with eight in 2015 and three in 2014. no contracts were terminated for default during such three-year period.
we may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixed-price and other government contracts and we may lose money if we fail to meet certain pre-specified targets in government contracts.
there is no guarantee that u.s. government contracts will be profitable. a number of our u.s. government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixed-price type contracts (54% of our total u.s. government contracts were fixed-price in 2016, 54% in 2015 and 58% in 2014). under these types of contracts, we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price. under such contracts, we must absorb cost overruns, notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts. we cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses. we may lose money or generate lower profits on some contracts if we fail to meet these estimates. we may also lose money on non-fixed price, cost-reimbursement contracts that contain dis-incentives or penalties related to cost, schedule or performance.
20
our business is subject to government contracting regulations, including increasingly complex regulations on cybersecurity and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects.
we, like other government contractors, are subject to various audits, reviews and investigations (including private party "whistleblower" lawsuits) relating to our compliance with federal and state laws. more routinely, the u.s. government may audit the costs we incur on our u.s. government contracts, including allocated indirect costs. such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs. any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed would need to be refunded. we have recorded contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize on final audit. in a worst case scenario, should a business or division involved be charged with wrongdoing, or should the u.s. government determine that the business or division is not a "presently responsible contractor", that business or division, and conceivably our company as a whole, could be temporarily suspended or, in the event of a conviction, could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or government-approved subcontracts. in addition, we could expend substantial amounts defending against such charges and in damages, fines and penalties if such charges were proven or were to result in negotiated settlements. the department of defense as well as other u.s. government contracting agencies have adopted new rules and regulations requiring contractors to implement a set of cyber security measures to attain the safeguarding of contractor systems that process, store, or transmit certain information. implementation and compliance with these new cyber security requirements is complex and costly, and could result in unforeseen expenses, lower profitability and, in the case of non-compliance, penalties and damages, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business.
our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness, could materially and adversely affect our business.
as of january 1, 2017, we had $611.7 million in total outstanding indebtedness. this indebtedness included $425.0 million in senior unsecured notes, $182.5 million in term loans and no amounts outstanding under our $750.0 million 2015-amended credit facility. as a result of our pending acquisition of e2v, we expect that our total indebtedness will initially increase by approximately $700.0 million. our indebtedness could harm our business by, among other things, reducing the funds available to make new strategic acquisitions or reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions. our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business. general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner.
our pension expense and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the stock market, interest rates and actuarial experience.
we have a domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most of our u.s. employees hired prior to 2004 or approximately 16% of our active employees. we also have several smaller domestic and foreign-based pension plans. as of january 1, 2017, the value of the combined pension assets is greater than our combined pension benefit obligations. the accounting rules applicable to our pension plans require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as contributions are made to the plan. two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations. declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase required contributions to our qualified pension plan and/or result in a change to shareholders' equity. our investment strategy may not produce the expected returns if the credit, financial or stock markets deteriorate. any decreases or increases in market interest rates will affect the discount rate assumption used in projecting pension benefit obligations. in addition, changes in other actuarial assumptions such as mortality assumptions or change due to legislative or regulatory actions could impact our pension income or expense as well as funding obligations. each year beginning with 2014, the society of actuaries released revised mortality tables, which updated life expectancy assumptions. in consideration of these tables, we updated the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and post-retirement obligations. in consideration of these tables, we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and post-retirement benefit obligations.  the impact of these mortality assumptions increased our pension obligation and increased future pension expense.  in 2013, we made a voluntary pretax cash contribution of $83.0 million to the domestic pension plan. no contributions were made to the domestic pension plan since the 2013 contribution. if, and to the extent, decreases in our pension assets are not offset by voluntary contributions, recovered through future asset returns, mitigated by an increase in the rate at which the benefit obligation is discounted, or other actions, our required cash contributions and pension expense could increase under the plans. for additional discussion of pension matters, see the discussion under "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition" and notes 2 and 11 to our notes to consolidated financial statements.
21
our business and operations could suffer in the event of cyber security breaches.
attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. these attempts, which might be related to industrial or foreign government espionage, activism, or other motivations, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks, performing reconnaissance, impersonating authorized users, stealing, corrupting or restricting our access to data, among other activities.  we continue to update our infrastructure, security tools and processes to protect against security incidents, including both external and internal threats, and to prevent their recurrence.  company personnel and third parties have been tasked to detect and investigate such incidents, but it is possible that we might not prevent or be aware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. the theft, corruption, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business.  we are subject to u.s. department of defense regulations applicable to certain types of data residing on or transiting through certain information systems, and we expect these regulations will be incorporated into certain contracts we hold.  to the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of confidential or controlled information of employees, third parties or the u.s. government, we may incur liability or the loss of contracts or security clearances as a result. in addition, we expect to continue devoting additional resources to the security of our information technology systems.   more resources may be required in the defense arena to the extent the u.s. government increases its cyber security mandates.
we may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions.
in order to remain competitive, we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities. our teledyne scientific company subsidiary, which serves as our primary research center, has been actively promoting and funding joint research and development projects with other teledyne businesses, including our teledyne oil & gas businesses, teledyne reynolds, inc., teledyne brown engineering, inc., dalsa and lecroy. the business of e2v, for which the design and development of specialized technology for high performance systems and equipment is integral, will, once acquired also require substantial investments in research and development. additionally, some of our businesses are actively pursuing governmental support and funding for some of their research and development initiatives, including dalsa with respect to its cmos and uncooled infrared image sensor development efforts. nonetheless, we may be unable to fund all of our research and development and capital investment needs or possible acquisitions. our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors, some of which will not be within our control, including the existence of bank and capital markets, investor perceptions of us, our businesses and the industries in which we operate, and general economic conditions. failure to successfully raise needed capital or generate cash flow on a timely or cost-effective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability.
limitations in customer funding for applied research and development and technology insertion projects and government support for research and development expenditures may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in some market areas.
we may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner or increase our participation in new markets, which could harm our profitability and prospects.
our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. in order to improve our product development capabilities we purchased the research center that is now teledyne scientific company in 2006 and in 2011 we purchased dalsa, which has access to a well-equipped mems research and development center. in 2013, we opened a 52,000-square-foot technology development center in daytona beach, florida primarily to serve the offshore oil and gas production and exploration industries. successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors, including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements, changes in technology and industry standards, our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors, and market acceptance. we may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements.
our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly address new industry standards and technological changes. we may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner.
additionally, new products may trigger increased warranty costs as information on such products is augmented by actual usage. accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be accelerated or condensed.
22
we intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments. we may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers' requirements, as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors.
technological change and evolving industry and regulatory standards could cause some of our products or services to become obsolete or non-competitive.
the markets for some of our products and services are characterized by rapid technological development, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements. a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services, or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology, could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could lead to reduced sales of those products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject to change, which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services. the political agenda of the new presidential administration may affect the level of environmental regulations and enforcement and government spending on scientific research, which could adversely impact the sales of our products and services, including sales of pollution monitoring instruments and instruments used to measure the earth's climate and climate change, such as undersea gliders and space-based imaging sensors.
we may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers' cost reduction mandates, which could harm our sales or margins.
more and more customers continue to seek price reductions of our products. while we continually work to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products, without affecting product quality and reliability, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so and do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers. cost reductions of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market conditions. customers may seek lower cost products from china and other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower.
the airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.
governmental agencies throughout the world, including the u.s. federal aviation administration, or the faa, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products. specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with faa requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. if any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of the product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
from time to time, the faa or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. if these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. recent trends by china's aviation authority to relax restrictions on airspace may be reversed, and anticipated new regulations loosening airspace restrictions may not materialize, which could impact the future prospects of our commercial aerospace businesses. china's aviation authorities recently adopted new safety regulations for airlines that resulted in increased sales of our avionics products in china in 2016. if these regulations are reversed, the growth prospects of our commercial aerospace business in china may be limited.
increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services.
each of our markets is highly competitive. many of our competitors have, and potential competitors could have, greater name recognition, a larger installed base of products, more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial, technological and personnel resources than we do. new or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services. industry acquisition and consolidation trends, particularly among aerospace and defense contractors, have adversely impacted demand for our aerospace and defense related engineering services as large prime contractors in-source increased amounts of major acquisition programs and also require significant expansion in small business participation to meet government contracting goals. low-cost competition from china and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products. increasing competition could reduce the volume of our sales or the prices we may charge, which would negatively impact our revenues. smaller defense budgets both in the united states and europe could result in additional competition for new and existing defense programs.
23
product liability claims, product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition and we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverage.
as a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products, including monitoring instruments, products used in offshore oil and gas production, products used in commercial aviation and products used in medical devices (most recently including x-ray detectors and generators), our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products. in part, product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product, which could adversely affect our results of operations. this could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts.
while we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities, we have self-insured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities. awarded damages could be more than our accruals. we could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well. we cannot assure that, for 2017 and in future years, insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability.
product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products. we cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any products.
we have been joined, among a number of defendants (often over 100), in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos. in addition, because of the prominent "teledyne" name, we may continue to be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spin-off. to date, we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits. however, our historic insurance coverage, including that of its predecessors, may not fully cover such claims and the defense of such matters. coverage typically depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors. nonetheless, we intend to vigorously defend our position against these claims.
certain gas generators historically manufactured by teledyne energy systems, inc. contained a sealed, wetted asbestos component. while the company has transitioned to a replacement material, had placed warning labels on its products and took care in the handling of this discontinued material by employees, there is no assurance that the company will not face product liability or workers' compensation claims involving this component.
our teledyne brown engineering, inc.'s laboratory in knoxville, tennessee performs radiological analyses. our teledyne dalsa professional imaging unit develops image sensors used in medical and dental x-ray applications along with portable x-ray generators used in non-destructive testing and security applications. in addition, our teledyne dalsa digital imaging unit develops equipment and sensors used in eye examination and general surgical vision applications. errors and omissions in analyses may occur or erroneous images could be captured. our insurance coverage or indemnities may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses.
teledyne brown engineering, inc. and other teledyne companies manufacture components for customers in the nuclear power market, including utilities and certain governmental entities. certain liabilities associated with such products are covered by the price-anderson nuclear industries indemnity act and other statutory and common law defenses, and we have received indemnities from some of our customers. however, there is no assurance we will not face product liability claims related to such products or that our exposure will not exceed the amounts for which we have liability coverage or protection.
our business and financial results could be adversely affected by conditions and other factors associated with our suppliers.
some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products are purchased from limited or single sources of supply due to technical capability, price and other factors. for example, dalsa has a single source of supply for ccd semiconductor wafers used to assemble image sensors and an external single source of supply for cmos semiconductor wafers used to assemble x-ray panel products. lecroy continues to outsource a portion of its research and development activities to a third party engineering firm in malaysia where it may be more difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights. we have also outsourced from time to time the manufacturing of certain parts, components, subsystems and even finished products to single or limited sources, including international sources. disruption of these sources could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increases in our costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operations. international sources possess additional risks, some of which are similar to those described above in regard to international sales. with any continuing disruption in the global economy and financial markets, some of our suppliers may also continue to face issues gaining access to sufficient credit and materials to maintain their businesses, which could reduce the availability of some components and, to the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers, could adversely affect our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our products. continuing economic pressure on suppliers may also trigger increased pricing or workforce reductions or reduced workweeks and a shrinking supply base, possibly creating longer lead times to obtain needed components for our products, delays in material acceptance and a greater risk of receiving counterfeit parts.
24
some of our commercial product lines may have one or a limited number of customers, the loss of which could adversely affect our business or financial results.
while no commercial customer accounted for more than 10% of our total sales during 2016, 2015 and 2014 and we have hundreds of customers in the various industries that we serve, some of our product lines may have one or a few key customers the loss of which could adversely affect our business or financial results. in 2016, no commercial customer accounted for more than 2.0% of total sales. teledyne's largest commercial customer in 2015 and 2014, a customer of our instrumentation segment, accounted for 2.3% and 2.8% of total sales in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
newer products, such as our x-ray generators and x-ray panel products, may initially be more heavily dependent on a singular or limited number of customers until market acceptance is obtained or due to contractual terms. similarly, some older product lines may be more heavily dependent on a singular or limited number of customers. in either such case, program delays of such customer or customers, as well as the loss of such customer or customers, could adversely affect our business or financial results.
we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control, which could harm our business.
we sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added resellers and oems (collectively "distributors"). using third parties for distribution exposes teledyne to many risks, including concentration, credit risk and compliance risks. we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivables and financial results. violations of the fcpa or similar anti-bribery laws by distributors or other third party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position, and could result in sanctions against us.
compliance with increasing environmental and climate change regulations, as well as the effects of potential environmental liabilities, could have a material adverse financial effect on us.
we, like other industry participants, are subject to various federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations. we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase. future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. environmental regulations on hydraulic fracturing and the use of seismic energy sources for offshore energy exploration could adversely affect some product lines of our instrumentation segment.
our manufacturing operations, including former operations, could expose us to material environmental liabilities. additionally, companies we acquire may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition.
the u.s. environmental protection agency ("epa") has focused on greenhouse gases ("ghgs"), maintaining ghgs threaten the public health and welfare of the american people. the epa also maintains that ghg emissions from on-road vehicles contribute to that threat. the epa's endangerment finding covers emissions of six greenhouse gases. the epa's continuing efforts to limit ghg emissions could adversely affect our u.s. manufacturing operations, increase prices for energy, fuel and transportation, require us to accommodate changes in parameters, such as the way parts are manufactured, and may, in some cases, require us to redesign certain of our products. this could lead to increased costs, which we may not be able to recover from customers, delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors.
for additional discussion of environmental matters, see the discussion under the caption "other matters - environmental" of "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operation and financial condition" and note 14 to our notes to consolidated financial statements.
our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success.
our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. we also have a maturing workforce. while we have engaged in succession planning, the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
25
we may not be able to sell, exit or reconfigure businesses, facilities or product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy or that should be consolidated.
consistent with our strategy to emphasize growth in our core markets, we continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy. this review led to the decision to sell the net assets of the printed circuit technology ("pct") business in 2016 and the general aviation piston engine businesses in 2011. as a result of our review and declines in our electronic manufacturing services businesses, in 2013, we closed our teledyne microelectronics technologies' facility in marina del rey, california and relocated several of its product lines to other teledyne locations. in further response to downturns in our defense businesses, in 2013, we also began consolidating some of our microelectronic component operations into our mountain view, california facility and also our shipley, england facility, and relatedly sold a former manufacturing site in sunnyvale, california. additionally, we closed teledyne cml group limited's precision machining and fabrications business in birkenhead, england to focus more on its advanced composites manufacturing business.
in 2015, we began to consolidate some of the businesses units and facilities in our instrumentation segment, and it continued into 2016. we may not be able to realize efficiencies and cost savings from these consolidation activities.  there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful.  if we do not successfully manage our current consolidation activities, or any other similar activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. our ability to dispose of, exit or reconfigure businesses that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors, including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement, as well as industry, business and economic conditions. we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell non-strategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. in addition, if the sale of any non-strategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical, alternative courses of action, including relocation of product lines or closure, may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated.
natural and man-made disasters could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
several of our facilities, as a result of their locations, could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados, floods, ice storms or other natural disasters. many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in california and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage in wildfires. teledyne dalsa's semiconductor facilities in quebec, canada have been impacted by severe ice storms, including a storm in 2013. in addition, we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened and struck by major hurricanes. in october 2012, lecroy and other teledyne facilities incurred business interruptions and were without power for several days as a result of hurricane sandy. our facilities in alabama, florida, nebraska, tennessee and virginia have also been threatened by tornados. in june 2012, a tornado caused substantial damage to and interrupted business at our teledyne hastings instruments facility in hampton, virginia. in april 2011, tornados caused substantial damage in huntsville, alabama. while teledyne brown engineering's main facility in huntsville, alabama incurred minimal building damage and business interruption, the facility was without power for several days. if any of our california facilities, including our california headquarters, were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our alabama, florida, louisiana, nebraska, tennessee or texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane, storm, tornado or other natural disaster, or if dalsa's facilities in quebec experience long-term loss of electrical power, such event could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities. while teledyne has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement, such insurance would not cover all possible losses. in addition, our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans (including those relating to our information technology systems) may not be fully responsive to, or minimize losses associated with, catastrophic events.
the environmental disaster triggered by the deepwater horizon rig explosion and oil spill in 2010 resulted in a moratorium on offshore oil and gas production in the gulf of mexico that adversely affected the results of operations of some of our teledyne oil and gas businesses, although such adverse impact was offset, in part, by the products we manufacture that supported well-capping and environmental clean-up efforts. environmental regulations enacted in the wake of this oil spill have resulted in increased compliance costs to some of our teledyne oil and gas businesses. similar future man-made disasters that limit or cease offshore oil and gas production or further exploration in the regions in which we sell our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
disasters that do not directly impact us can have an indirect adverse impact on our business. for example, in 2011 the earthquake in northern japan and the related tsunami and severe flooding in thailand resulted in certain of our customers delaying orders for our products because they were unable to obtain critical supplies from vendors in the impacted areas.
26
teledyne brown engineering, inc. is building an imaging platform to be affixed to the iss. for the program to be financially successful, the 18 year-old iss must continue to fly in a safe and human tended condition. while certain spaceflight risks, such as a high-velocity debris impact to the station causing significant structural damage or necessitating the evacuation of the iss, have been regarded as small, if such event were to occur, the iss program continuation could be threatened, jeopardizing our investment and potential revenue generation from iss-based earth imaging.
we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, or third parties may claim infringement of their intellectual rights, each which may harm our ability to compete and thus harm our business.
our ability to enforce and protect our patents, copyrights, software licenses, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries. when we seek to enforce our rights, we have found that various claims may be asserted against us, including claims that our intellectual property right is invalid, is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim. in addition, we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties. if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation, we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction, or we may have to pay damages that could, in turn, harm our results of operations. our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business.
higher tax rates may harm our results of operations and cash flow.
our effective tax rate for 2016 was 20.9%, compared with 24.3% for 2015 and 23.6% for 2014. while the new presidential administration has commented about lowering the corporate tax rate in the united states to improve global competitiveness, a number of factors may impact our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income and increase our tax payments, including:
•   the relative amount of income we earn in jurisdictions;
•   changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the united states to the taxation of foreign income and expenses, changes in tax laws in foreign jurisdictions, and changes in u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and governing body pronouncements and interpretations;
•   the resolution of issues arising from tax audits;
•   changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, including deferred tax valuation allowances;
•   adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;
•   increases in expense not deductible for tax purposes;
•   changes in available tax credits; and
•   any decision to repatriate non-u.s. earnings for which we have not previously provided for u.s. taxes.
our inability to efficiently implement changes to our enterprise resource planning software could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment, operations and profitability.
we are implementing enterprise resource planning software systems, which are intended to improve our business processes in certain business units. the costs associated with such systems can be significant and we could incur costs in excess of budgeted costs. any technical or other difficulties in developing or implementing this initiative may increase the costs of the project and have an adverse effect on our operations and reporting processes, including our internal controls over financial reporting. as we make adjustments to operations as a result of this project, we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure. although implementation has occurred in only selected business units to date and efforts have been made to minimize adverse impacts on our controls, we cannot assure that all such impacts have been mitigated. further, we may not realize anticipated cost improvements and greater efficiencies from the project.
our financial statements are based on estimates required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"), and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions.
our financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap. these principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. for example, estimates are used when accounting for items such as asset valuations, allowances for doubtful accounts, allowance for excess and obsolete inventory, depreciation and amortization, impairment assessments, employee benefits, taxes, recall and warranty costs, product and general liability and contingencies. while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made, actual results may differ materially from those estimated. our most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in this form 10-k under "critical accounting estimates."

while we believe our internal control systems are effective, there are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.
we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls, disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud. a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. in addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. the design of any system of controls is also based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.
provisions of our governing documents, applicable law, and our change in control severance agreements could make an acquisition of teledyne more difficult.
our restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of teledyne, in a transaction not approved by our board of directors, more difficult. we have also entered into change in control severance agreements with thirteen members of our current management, which could have an anti-takeover effect. these provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our company.
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since we became a public company, and could continue to do so.
since we became an independent public company on november 29, 1999, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and fluctuations in our stock price could continue. in fiscal 2015, our stock price declined 15% and in fiscal 2016, our stock increased 38.6%. among the factors that could affect our stock price are:
•   quarterly variations in our operating results;
•   strategic actions by us or our competitors;
•   acquisitions;
•   divestitures;
•   stock repurchases;
•   adverse business developments;
•   war in the middle east or elsewhere;
•   terrorists activities;
•   military or homeland defense activities;
•   changes to the u.s. federal budget;
•   changes in the energy exploration or production, semiconductor, digital imaging, telecommunications, commercial aviation, and electronic manufacturing services markets;
•   general market conditions;
•   changes in tax laws;
•   general economic factors unrelated to our performance;
•   changes from analysts' expectations in revenues, earnings or other financial results; and
•   one or more of the risk factors described in this report.
the stock markets in general, and the markets for high-technology companies in particular, have experienced a high degree of volatility that is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies. we cannot provide assurances as to our stock price. we have in the past repurchased shares of our stock pursuant to board-approved stock repurchase programs. we cannot provide assurances that we will continue to repurchase shares under those programs, or that our board will authorize new repurchase programs.

on december 12, 2016, teledyne and e2v technologies plc ("e2v") reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition to be made by teledyne for the ordinary share capital of e2v by means of a scheme of arrangement (the "offer"). under the terms of the offer, e2v's ordinary shareholders ("e2v shareholders") will receive 275 pence in cash for each e2v share valuing the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of e2v at approximately £619.6 million on a fully diluted basis. it is expected that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all relevant conditions, the acquisition will be completed in the first half of calendar 2017. at meetings held in january 2017, e2v shareholders voted in favor of the resolution to approve the scheme of arrangement and voted to pass a special resolution to approve the implementation of the scheme.  the waiting periods required under both the u.s. hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, and in respect of the e2v's u.s. state department's itar registration have expired.  clearance or expiration of the waiting period under german merger control laws remains outstanding.  after discussions with the german authorities, e2v and teledyne submitted a revised application for clearance on february 24, 2017 in respect of the acquisition.  the german authorities have one month to review such revised submission. clearance from the french ministry of economy and finance and the french ministry of defense in respect of the acquisition also remains outstanding. teledyne expects to fund the acquisition from cash on hand and its credit facility, as well as the anticipated proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and term loans.
for the machine vision market, e2v provides high performance image sensors and custom camera solutions and application specific standard products. in addition, e2v provides high performance space qualified imaging sensors and arrays for space science and astronomy. e2v also produces components and subsystems that deliver high reliability radio frequency power generation for healthcare, industrial and defense applications. finally, the company provides high reliability semiconductors and board-level solutions for use in aerospace, space and radio frequency communications applications. at announcement, the aggregate enterprise value for the transaction is expected to be approximately £627.1 million (or approximately $788.9 million) taking into account e2v stock options and net debt. for its fiscal year ended march 31, 2016, e2v had sales of approximately £236.4 million.
in connection with our strategy, in the third quarter of 2016, teledyne completed the disposition of the net assets of its printed circuit technology ("pct") business for $9.3 million in cash, resulting in no gain or loss. pct was part of the aerospace and defense electronics segment. in connection with the sale, we entered into a transition services agreement, effective july 8, 2016, to provide certain administrative services to facilitate the orderly transfer of the business operations to the buyer, with the transition services agreement expected to continue through the first half of 2017. in addition, in 2016 we sold a former operating facility in california and recorded a pretax gain of $17.9 million, and incurred pretax charges totaling $7.9 million related to the pending e2v acquisition.

total year 2016 and 2015 reflected pretax charges totaling $17.3 million and $8.4 million, respectively, for severance and facility consolidation charges. net income for 2016 and 2015 also included net discrete tax benefits of $10.9 million and $9.8 million, respectively. we also recorded a gain in 2016 of $17.9 million on the sale of a former operating facility in california, and incurred pretax charges totaling $7.9 million related to the pending e2v acquisition.
sales the decrease in sales in 2016, compared with 2015, reflected lower sales in the instrumentation and engineered systems segments, partially offset by higher sales in the aerospace and defense and electronics and digital imaging segments. sales in the instrumentation segment reflected $15.6 million of incremental sales from recent acquisitions while sales in the digital imaging segment reflected $9.6 million of incremental sales from recent acquisitions. the incremental sales from recent acquisitions in 2016 was $25.2 million.
sales under contracts with the u.s. government were approximately 27% of sales in 2016 and 26% of sales in 2015. sales to international customers represented approximately 43% of sales in 2016 and 44% of sales in 2015.
cost of sales total company cost of sales decreased by $109.8 million in 2016, compared with 2015, which primarily reflected the impact of lower sales, partially offset by higher severance and facility consolidation expenses of $3.1 million. the total company cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2016 was 61.3%, compared with 62.1% for 2015.

selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses, including company-funded research and development and bid and proposal expense, in total dollars were lower in 2016, compared with 2015. the decrease reflected the impact of lower sales, partially offset by higher severance and facility consolidation expenses of $5.8 million. corporate administrative expense in 2016 was $46.1 million, compared with $40.2 million in 2015, an increase of 14.7%. the increase in corporate administrative expense reflected higher professional fees expense, including $1.9 million related to the pending e2v acquisition. for 2016, we recorded a total of $11.6 million in stock option expense, of which $3.2 million was recorded as corporate expense and $8.4 million was recorded in the operating segment results. for 2015, we recorded a total of $12.2 million in stock option expense, of which $3.4 million was recorded as corporate expense and $8.8 million was recorded in the operating segment results. selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, was 26.9% for 2016, compared with 25.6% for 2015 and reflected the impact of higher research and development and bid and proposal expense, higher severance and facility consolidation expenses and professional fees expense related to the pending e2v acquisition.
pension income/expense included in operating income in 2016 was pension income of $2.2 million compared with pension expense of $3.0 million in 2015. the change to pension income in 2016 from pension expense in 2015 primarily reflected the impact of using a 4.91 percent discount rate to determine the benefit obligation for the domestic plan in 2016 compared with a 4.50 percent discount rate used in 2015. included in the $3.0 million of pension expense in 2015, in the first quarter of 2015, teledyne froze its non-qualified pension plan for top executives which resulted in a one-time gain of $1.2 million. pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to u.s. government cost accounting standards ("cas") was $13.8 million for both 2016 and 2015. pension expense determined under cas can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services sold to the u.s. government.
operating income operating income for 2016 was $253.8 million, compared with $281.7 million for 2015, a decrease of 9.9%. the decrease in operating income primarily reflected lower costs as a result of the lower sales. operating income in 2016 and 2015 included $17.3 million and $8.4 million in severance and facility consolidation costs, respectively. the incremental operating loss included in the results for 2016 from recent acquisitions was $0.6 million which included $1.3 million in additional intangible asset amortization expense. operating income in 2016 included pension income of $2.2 million compared to pension expense of $3.0 million in 2015.
interest expense and other income and expense total interest expense, including credit facility fees and other bank charges, was $23.6 million in 2016, including $0.5 million related to the pending e2v acquisition, and $24.0 million in 2015. interest income was $0.3 million in 2016 and $0.1 million in 2015. other income for 2016 included a gain of $17.9 million on the sale of a former operating facility in california. other income and expense in 2016 reflected $5.5 million of expense for a foreign currency hedge contract related to the pending e2v acquisition. other income and expense in 2015 included net gains on legal settlements of $3.0 million.
income taxes the company's effective tax rate for 2016 was 20.9%, compared with 24.3% for 2015. total year 2016 reflected $10.9 million in net discrete income tax benefits. the net discrete income tax benefits of $10.9 million, includes $6.7 million in income tax expense related to the $17.9 million gain on the sale of the operating facility and a $8.5 million income tax benefit related to the adoption of asu 2016-09, as well as $9.1 million income tax benefit for the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations, the release of valuation allowances and a favorable tax ruling in the netherlands. total year 2015 included net discrete tax benefits of $9.8 million primarily related to the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions which were mainly due to the expiration of statute of limitations and the release of valuation allowances. total year 2016 and 2015 also included $4.1 million and $5.9 million in federal research and development tax credits, respectively. excluding the net discrete income tax benefits in both years, and the gain and related taxes on the operating facility sale in 2016, the effective tax rates would have been 27.4% for 2016 and 28.1% for 2015.

selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses, including company-funded research and development and bid and proposal expense, in total dollars were lower in 2015 compared with 2014. the decrease reflected the impact of lower sales and lower corporate administrative expense. corporate administrative expense in 2015 was $40.2 million, compared with $43.9 million in 2014, a decrease of 8.4%. the decrease in corporate administrative expense reflected lower compensation and professional fees expense. for 2015, we recorded a total of $12.2 million in stock option expense, of which $3.4 million was recorded as corporate expense and $8.8 million was recorded in the operating segment results. for 2014, we recorded a total of $14.0 million in stock option expense, of which $4.5 million was recorded as corporate expense and $9.5 million was recorded in the operating segment results. stock option expense in 2015 was lower than in 2014 primarily due to the absence of stock option grants in 2015. selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, were 25.6% for both 2015 and 2014.
pension income/expense included in operating income in 2015 was pension expense of $3.0 million compared with pension income of $1.3 million in 2014. the change to pension expense in 2015 from pension income in 2014 primarily reflected the impact of using a 4.5 percent discount rate to determine the benefit obligation for the domestic plan in 2015 compared with a 5.4 percent discount rate used in 2014. in the first quarter of 2015, teledyne froze its non-qualified pension plan for top executives which resulted in a one-time gain of $1.2 million. pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to cas was $13.8 million for both 2015 and 2014.
operating income operating income for 2015 was $281.7 million, compared with $294.5 million for 2014, a decrease of 4.3%. operating income reflected the impact of lower sales. operating income in 2015 and 2014 included $8.4 million and $4.2 million in severance costs, respectively. the incremental operating loss included in the results for 2015 from recent acquisitions was $3.7 million which included $3.3 million in additional intangible asset amortization expense. operating income in 2015 included pension expense of $3.0 million compared to pension income of $1.3 million in 2014.
interest expense and other income and expense total interest expense, including credit facility fees and other bank charges, was $24.0 million in 2015 and $19.2 million in 2014. the increase in interest expense primarily reflected the impact of higher outstanding debt levels, due to recent acquisitions and stock repurchases. interest income was $0.1 million in 2015 and $0.2 million in 2014. other income and expense in 2015 and 2014 included net gains on legal settlements of $3.0 million and $6.5 million, respectively.
income taxes the company's effective tax rate for 2015 was 24.3%, compared with 23.6% for 2014. total year 2015 included net discrete tax benefits of $9.8 million primarily related to the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions which were mainly due to the expiration of statute of limitations and the release of valuation allowances. total year 2015 also included $5.9 million in federal research and development tax credits. total year 2014 included net discrete tax benefits of $8.9 million primarily related to the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions, which were mainly due to an expiration of statute of limitations and the favorable resolution of a tax matter. total year 2014 also included $5.6 million in federal research and development tax credits. excluding the impact of the net discrete tax benefits of $9.8 million for 2015 and $8.9 million for 2014, the effective tax rates would have been 28.1% for 2015, compared with 26.7% for 2014.

financial condition, liquidity and capital resources principal capital requirements our principal cash and capital requirements are to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, income tax payments, pension contributions and debt service requirements, as well as acquisitions and the pending e2v acquisition. we may also deploy cash for the stock repurchase program. it is anticipated that operating cash flow, together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below, will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund acquisitions in 2017. to support acquisitions, we may need to raise additional capital. our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of off-balance sheet financial arrangements. we have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose or unconsolidated entities.
credit facility, senior notes and term loans in december 2016, the company entered into an amendment relating to unsecured term loans of $182.5 million in aggregate principal amount (the "term loans") to extend the maturity date of the term loans from march 1, 2019 to january 31, 2022 and extending the date on which amortization of principal begins; and generally lowering the applicable rate for base rate and eurocurrency loans. the other material terms of the term loans, including covenants, remain unchanged. in november 2015, the company issued $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes ("senior unsecured notes"). the notes consisted of $25.0 million of 2.81% senior unsecured notes due in november 2020, and $100.0 million of 3.28% senior unsecured notes due in november 2022. also in december 2015, the company amended the $750.0 million unsecured credit facility ("credit facility") to extend the maturity from march 2018 to december 2020. excluding interest and fees, no payments are due under the credit facility until it matures. borrowings under our credit facility and term loans are at variable rates which are, at our option, tied to a eurocurrency rate equal to libor (london interbank offered rate) plus an applicable rate or a base rate as defined in our credit agreements. eurocurrency rate loans may be denominated in u.s. dollars or an alternative currency as defined in the agreement. eurocurrency or libor based loans under the facility typically have terms of one, two, three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date. the company has not drawn any loans with a term longer than three months under the credit facility. base rate loans have interest rates that primarily fluctuate with changes in the prime rate. interest rates are also subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. the credit facility also provides for facility fees that vary between 0.12% and 0.25% of the credit line, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as calculated from time to time.
in connection with the agreement to acquire e2v, teledyne, together with certain of its subsidiaries as guarantors, has entered into a credit agreement (the "bridge facility") dated december 11, 2016. the lenders under the bridge facility are committed to lend up to £345.0 million to fund the acquisition, and teledyne has committed to have remain available for borrowing up to $410.0 million under its $750.0 million credit facility to fund the acquisition. no amounts have been drawn against the bridge facility to date.

our credit facility, senior notes and term loans agreements require the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants, including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios, as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt. at january 1, 2017, the company was in compliance with these covenants and we had a significant amount of margin between required financial covenant ratios and our actual ratios. currently, we do not believe our ability to undertake additional debt financing, if needed, is reasonably likely to be materially impacted by debt restrictions under our credit agreements subject to our complying with required financial covenants listed in the table below.
financial covenant ratios and the actual ratios at january 1, 2017:
$750.0 million credit facility expires december 2020 and $182.5 million term loans due through january 2022 (issued in october 2012)
financial covenant                                           requirement                                                                                actual measure consolidated leverage ratio (net debt/ebitda) (a)            no more than 3.25 to 1                                                                           1.7 to 1

consolidated interest coverage ratio (ebitda/interest) (b)   no less than 3.0 to 1                                                                           16.0 to 1
(a)   the consolidated leverage ratio is equal to net debt/ebitda as defined in our private placement note purchase agreement and our $750.0 million credit agreement.
(b)   the consolidated interest coverage ratio is equal to ebitda/interest as defined in our private placement note purchase agreement and our $750.0 million credit agreement.
in the event of an acquisition, our debt instruments permit us, at our option, to exceed the consolidated leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1 for up to four quarters following the fiscal quarter in which the acquisition event occurs, provided that the consolidated leverage ratio does not exceed 3.5 to 1.  if the pending acquisition of e2v closes, we expect to remain in compliance with this financial ratio as a result.
available borrowing capacity under the $750.0 million credit facility, which is reduced by borrowings and outstanding letters of credit, was $735.5 million at january 1, 2017; noting, however, that teledyne has committed to have remain available for borrowing up to $410.0 million under this facility to fund the pending e2v acquisition.
teledyne also has a $5.0 million uncommitted credit line which permits credit extensions up to $5.0 million plus an incremental $2.0 million solely for standby letters of credit. this credit line is utilized, as needed, for periodic cash needs. at january 1, 2017, $3.5 million was outstanding under the uncommitted credit line. no amounts were outstanding under this credit line at january 3, 2016.
permanently reinvested earnings we intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our material foreign subsidiaries in our operations outside of the united states. the cash that the company's foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including acquisitions. we expect to fund a portion of the cost of the e2v acquisition with cash held by our foreign subsidiaries. we estimate that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash requirements. at january 1, 2017, the amount of undistributed foreign earnings was $226.6 million, of which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $59.0 million. should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the united states.

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at january 1, 2017. we have not included information on our normal recurring purchases of materials for use in our operations. we have also not included any amounts that may be required related to our pending acquisition of e2v.
the amounts in the following table are generally consistent from year to year, closely reflect our levels of production and are not long-term in nature:

(a)   interest expense related to the credit facility, including facility fees, is assumed to accrue at the rates in effect at year-end 2016 and is assumed to be paid at the end of each quarter with the final payment in december 2020 when the credit facility expires.
(b)   includes imputed interest and short-term portion.
(c)   purchase obligations generally include contractual obligations for the purchase of goods and services.
unrecognized tax benefits of $24.5 million are not included in the table above because $7.1 million is offset by deferred tax assets, and the remainder cannot be reasonably estimated to be settled in cash due to a lack of prior settlement history.
at january 1, 2017, we were not required, and accordingly are not planning, to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified pension plan for 2017. our minimum funding requirements after 2017, as set forth by erisa, are dependent on several factors as discussed under "accounting for pension plans" in the critical accounting policies section of this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation. estimates beyond 2017 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts, which are subject to change until the company's pension assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times. in addition, certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the u.s. government under certain government contracts, therefore, the amounts noted are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on our liquidity. we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit plans. these plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. see further discussion in note 11 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. teledyne intends to continue to monitor and manage its defined benefit pension plans obligation and may take additional actions to manage risk in the future.
operating activities in 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $317.0 million, compared with $210.2 million in 2015 and $287.9 million in 2014. the higher cash provided by operating activities in 2016, compared with 2015, reflected $61.9 million in lower income tax payments, lower annual bonus and regular payroll payments and higher customer advanced payments, partially offset by higher payments for severance, facility closure and relocation costs and lower operating income. the 2015 amounts reflected the receipt of $3.0 million related to a legal settlement while the 2014 amount reflected the receipt of $10.0 million related to a legal settlement. the lower cash provided by operating activities in 2015, compared with 2014, reflected lower net income, lower customer deposits and advanced payments and higher income tax payments.
free cash flow (cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) was $229.4 million in 2016, compared with $163.2 million in 2015 and $244.4 million in 2014. adjusted free cash flow reflects utilization of restricted cash from the sale of a former operating facility which funded, in part, the facility purchase pursuant to a 1031 like-kind exchange and was $248.9 million in 2016, compared with $163.2 million in 2015 and $244.4 million in 2014.

a)   we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities (a measure prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles) less capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. adjusted free cash flow reflects utilization of restricted cash from the sale of a former operating facility which funded, in part, the facility purchase pursuant to a 1031 like-kind exchange. the company believes that this supplemental non-gaap information is useful to assist management and the investment community in analyzing the company's ability to generate cash flow.

the increase in the current portion of long-term debt primarily reflects the expected repayment in 2017 of $100.0 million in term loans. the increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss reflects the impact of foreign currency adjustments and the non-cash reduction to stockholders' equity for the pension and postretirement plans.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $151.0 million, $109.9 million and $238.7 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. cash flows relating to investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, except 2016 also includes $9.3 million of cash received from the sale of a business and cash received of $19.5 million from the sale of a former operating facility.

$87.6             $47.0             $43.5
the increase in capital spending in 2016, compared with 2015, primarily reflected the purchase of an operating facility. during 2017 we plan to invest approximately $60.0 million in capital expenditures, principally to upgrade capital equipment, reduce manufacturing costs and introduce new products. commitments at january 1, 2017, for capital expenditures were approximately $9.5 million.
acquisitions investing activities used cash for acquisitions and investments of $93.4 million, $66.7 million and $195.8 million, in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively (see "recent acquisitions").
teledyne funded the acquisitions primarily from borrowings under its credit facility and cash on hand.
for all acquisitions, the results of operations and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition. the caris, icm and axiom acquisitions are part of the digital imaging segment. all other acquisitions in 2016, 2015 and 2014 are part of the instrumentation segment.

goodwill resulting from the acquisitions of frontline, quantum data, in usa and caris made in 2016 will be deductible for tax purposes. goodwill resulting from the 2016 acquisition of hanson research and the 2015 acquisitions of bowtech and icm will not be deductible for tax purposes.
financing activities financing activities for 2016 reflected net payments on debt of $163.1 million, compared with net payments on debt of $47.6 million in 2015 and net proceeds from debt of $29.5 million for 2014. in addition, in both 2015 and 2014, the company issued $125.0 million of senior unsecured notes. financing activities in 2016 also included the payment of $11.6 million for an option contract in connection with the pending e2v acquisition.
fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 reflect proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $36.1 million, $19.0 million and $18.3 million, respectively. financing activities for 2015 and 2014 also reflected the repurchase of common stock of $243.8 million and $146.6 million, respectively. share repurchases totaled 2,561,815 shares in 2015 and 1,396,290 shares in 2014. see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our stock repurchase program.
other matters pension plans teledyne has a domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all u.s. employees hired before january 1, 2004, or approximately 16% of teledyne's active employees. as of january 1, 2004, new u.s. hires participate in a domestic defined contribution plan. in 2016, 2015 and 2014, teledyne's domestic pension plan was over 100% funded, thus no cash contributions were made. for the company's domestic pension plan, the discount rate for 2017 will decrease to 4.54% from 4.91% in 2016. the company also has several smaller domestic and foreign-based defined benefit pension plans.
income taxes our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and
49
results of recent operations. in projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income. based on the company's history of operating earnings, expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies, management believes that it is possible that some portion of deferred taxes will not be realized as a future tax benefit and therefore has recorded a valuation allowance.
we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions. the company has substantially concluded on all u.s. federal income tax matters for all years through 2012, california income tax matters for all years through 2011 and canadian income tax matters for all years through 2008.
costs and pricing inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate. current inventory costs, the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing policies. the company emphasizes cost containment in all aspects of its business.
hedging activities and market risk disclosures teledyne transacts business in various foreign currencies and has international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, subjecting the company to foreign currency risk. the company's primary objective is to protect the united states dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings. the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in canadian dollars for our canadian companies, including dalsa. these contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.
the effectiveness of the cash flow hedge contracts, excluding time value, is assessed prospectively and retrospectively on a monthly basis using regression analysis, as well as using other timing and probability criteria. to receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedges and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. the effective portion of the cash flow hedge contracts' gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) ("aoci") in stockholders' equity until the underlying hedged item is reflected in our consolidated statements of income, at which time the effective amount in accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income. the company expects to reclassify a loss of approximately $0.8 million, net of tax, over the next 12 months based on the year-end 2016 exchange rate.
in the event that the gains or losses in aoci are deemed to be ineffective, the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value, if any, is reclassified to other income and expense. in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur, or it becomes remote that they will occur, within the defined hedge period, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges will be reclassified from aoci to other income and expense. during the current reporting period, all forecasted transactions occurred and, therefore, there were no such gains or losses reclassified to other income and expense. as of january 1, 2017, teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy canadian dollars and to sell u.s. dollars totaling $56.8 million and these contracts had a negative fair value of $1.1 million. these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from march 2017 to february 2018.
in addition, the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, including intercompany receivables and payables. as of january 1, 2017, teledyne had foreign currency contracts of this type in the following currency pairs (in millions):
contracts to buy                            contracts to sell currency               amount               currency             amount canadian dollars       c$     32.1          u.s. dollars         us$     24.2

50
these contracts had a fair value of $5.4 million at january 1, 2017. the gains and losses on these derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments, are intended to, at a minimum, partially offset the transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings. all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. as discussed below, the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. teledyne does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes.
notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risks, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the u.s. dollar from its value at january 1, 2017, would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts associated with our cash flow hedging activities by $5.7 million. a hypothetical 10% depreciation of the u.s. dollar from its value at january 1, 2017, would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts associated with our cash flow hedging activities by $5.7 million.
borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility. loans under the facility typically have terms of one, two, three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date. interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio. as of january 1, 2017, we had no amounts outstanding under our $750.0 million credit facility. any borrowings under the company's revolving credit line are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and, consequently, the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates.
we believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities. our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks. we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable.
environmental we are subject to various federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, commonly known as superfund, and comparable state laws. we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites. reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled $7.0 million at january 1, 2017, and $8.7 million at january 3, 2016. as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received, the company will adjust accruals to reflect new information. based on current information, we do not believe that future environmental costs, in excess of those already accrued, will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity. see also our environmental risk factor disclosure beginning on page 25 and notes 2 and 14 to our notes to consolidated financial statements.
government contracts we perform work on a number of contracts with the u.s. department of defense and other agencies and departments of the u.s. government including sub-contracts with government prime contractors. sales under these contracts with the u.s. government, which included contracts with the u.s. department of defense, were approximately 27% of total sales in 2016, 26% of total sales in 2015 and 25% of total sales in 2014. for a summary of sales to the u.s. government by segment, see note 12 to our notes to consolidated financial statements. sales to the u.s. department of defense represented approximately 21%, 19% and 20% of total sales for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations, which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. see also our government contracts risks factor disclosure beginning on page 19.
for information on accounts receivable from the u.s. government, see note 5 to our notes to consolidated financial statements.
estimates and reserves our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to product returns and replacements, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, pension and other postretirement benefits, long-term contracts, environmental, workers' compensation and general liability, employee dental and medical benefits and other contingencies and litigation. we
51
base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time, the results of which form the basis for making our judgments. actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. in some cases, such differences may be material. see also critical accounting policies.
the following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts, which are estimates and based on judgments as described above, at january 1, 2017, and january 3, 2016 (in millions):

(b) includes both long-term and short-term reserves.
some of the company's products are subject to standard warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties. we regularly assess the adequacy of our pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products, as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties, which are typically one year. the product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet.

critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment, complexity and uncertainty, and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. we have identified the following as critical accounting policies: revenue recognition; accounting for pension plans; accounting for business combinations, goodwill and other long-lived assets; and accounting for income taxes. for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the earnings process is substantially complete and all of the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) our price to our customer is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured.
we determine the appropriate method by which we recognize revenue by analyzing the terms and conditions of our contracts or arrangements entered into with our customers. the majority of our revenue relates to product sales and is recognized upon shipment to the customer, at fixed or determinable prices and with a reasonable assurance of collection, passage of title to the customer and fulfillment of all significant obligations. revenue is recognized net of estimated sales returns and other allowances. the company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to customers. the remaining revenue is generally associated with long-term contracts to design, develop and manufacture highly engineered products used in commercial or defense applications. such contracts are generally accounted for using contract accounting, percentage-of-completion ("poc") method.
52
the company's standard terms of sale are fob shipping point. for a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at destination point, and assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met, the company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer. if any significant obligation to the customer with respect to a sales transaction remains following shipment, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled. in general, our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based on customer specified acceptance criteria. in those circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist, and if we cannot demonstrate that the system meets those specifications prior to the shipment, then revenue is deferred until customer acceptance is obtained.
we have a few contracts that require the company to warehouse certain goods, for which revenue is recognized when all risks of loss is borne by the customer and all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
we also have a small number of multiple elements arrangements (i.e., free product, training, installation, additional parts, etc.). if contract accounting does not apply, we allocate the contract price among the deliverables based on vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value to each element in the arrangement. if objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any element is not available, we use our best estimate of selling price for purposes of allocating the total arrangement consideration among the elements. also, extended or non-customary warranties do not represent a significant portion of our revenue; however when our revenue arrangements include an extended or non-customary warranty provision, the revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the extended warranty period.
for contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period (generally one or more years), revenue is recorded under the poc method. we record net revenue and an estimated profit as work on our contracts progresses. the poc method for these contracts is dependent on the nature of the contract or products provided. depending on the contract, we may measure the extent of progress toward completion using the units-of-delivery method, cost-to-cost method or upon attainment of scheduled performance contract milestones which could be time, event or expense driven. for example, for cost-reimbursable contracts we use the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize revenue and an estimated profit as allowable costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. another example, for contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items, we record revenue and an estimated profit on a poc basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract. occasionally, it is appropriate to combine individual customer orders and treat them as one arrangement when the underlying agreement was reached with the customer for a single large project.
accounting for contracts using the poc method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenue and cost, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. contract revenue may include estimated amounts not contractually agreed to by the customer, including price redetermination, cost or performance incentives (such as award and incentives fees), un-priced change orders, claims and requests for equitable adjustment. the poc method requires management's judgment to make reasonably dependable cost estimates generally over a long time period. since certain contracts extend over a long period of time, the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings on a cumulative catch-up basis. this method recognizes, in the current period, the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters. additionally, if the current contract estimate indicates a loss, a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident. contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed at least quarterly.

we do not believe that any discrete event or adjustment to an individual contract within the aggregate changes in contract estimates for 2016, 2015 or 2014 was material to the consolidated statements of income for such annual periods.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. for a discussion of this new accounting standard see note 2 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements.

pension plans teledyne has a domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all u.s. employees hired before january 1, 2004, or approximately 16% of teledyne's active employees. as of january 1, 2004, new u.s. hires participate in a defined contribution plan only. the company also has several smaller domestic and foreign-based defined benefit pension plans. at january 1, 2017, the benefit obligation for the domestic defined benefit pension plans totaled $810.9 million and the fair value of the net qualified plan assets totaled $857.1 million. at january 1, 2017, the benefit obligation for the foreign-based pension plans totaled $51.4 million and the fair value of the net plan assets totaled $42.1 million. the company's accounting for its defined benefit pension plans requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as contributions are made to the plan. in consultation with our actuaries, we determine the appropriate assumptions for use in determining the liability for future pension benefits. net actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a plan-by-plan basis when they exceed the accounting corridor. the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10 percent of the greater of the market related value of assets or benefit obligations. gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over our average employee future service period of approximately nine years. significant assumptions used in determining the company's pension income or expense is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant mortality estimates, expected rates of increase in future compensation levels, employee turnover, as well as the assumed discount rate on pension obligations. the company has assumed, based upon the types of securities the domestic qualified pension plan assets are invested in and the long-term historical returns of these investments, that the long-term expected return on the domestic qualified pension plan assets will be 8.0% in 2017 and the assumed discount rate for determining benefit obligations will be 4.54% in 2017. the company's long-term expected return on the domestic qualified pension assets used in 2016 was 8.0% and the assumed discount rate used in 2016 was 4.91%. the actual rate of return on the domestic qualified pension plan assets was 7.09% in 2016 and a negative return of 1.1% in 2015 for its domestic qualified pension plan. if the actual rate of return on pension assets is below the expected rate of return, the company may be required to make additional contributions to the pension trust. at january 1, 2017, the domestic qualified pension plan is over-funded and contributions are not required. the company did not make any cash contributions to its domestic qualified pension plan since 2013 when it made a voluntary pretax cash contribution of $83.0 million, before recovery from the u.s. government. each year beginning with 2014, the society of actuaries released revised mortality tables, which updated life expectancy assumptions. in consideration of these tables, we updated the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension obligations. the net impact of these new mortality assumptions has resulted in an increase to our pension obligation and an increase in future pension expense. our plan remains over-funded after the impact of the new mortality assumptions, as well as from changes to other relevant assumptions. at year-end 2016, the company has a $249.6 million non-cash reduction to stockholders' equity and a long-term additional liability of $396.9 million related to its pension plans. at year-end 2015, the company had a $232.3 million non-cash reduction to stockholders' equity and a long-term additional liability of $370.4 million related to its pension plans.
differences in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2016 pension expense (in millions):
0.25 percentage point increase               0.25 percentage point decrease increase (decrease) to pension expense resulting from:
change in discount rate                                  $(1.4                     )                               $1.5
change in long-term rate of return on plan assets        $(2.3                     )                               $2.3

business combinations, goodwill and acquired intangible assets the results for all acquisitions are included in the company's consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition. business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. we determine the fair value of such assets and liabilities, generally in consultation with third-party valuation advisors. acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period.
goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. we review goodwill and acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year. we would test goodwill and acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in

an entity's market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business, or other factors. based on an annual impairment test completed in 2016, there was no impairment to acquired intangible assets. based on a quarterly impairment test completed in 2016, the company recorded a $1.0 million impairment to acquired intangible assets. based on a quarterly impairment test completed in 2015, the company recorded a $0.5 million impairment to acquired intangible assets. no impairment of goodwill was indicated in 2016 or 2015, based on the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of each year.
for goodwill impairment testing, the company estimates the fair value of the reporting units, using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans, and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values over a multi-year period. there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. if actual results are not consistent with management's estimates and assumptions, goodwill may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings.
as of january 1, 2017, the company had 17 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. the carrying value of goodwill included in the company's individual reporting units ranges from $1.0 million to $422.5 million. the company's analysis in 2016 indicated that in all instances, the fair value of the company's reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value of the respective reporting unit) for each of the company's reporting units as of the fourth quarter of 2016, the annual testing date, ranged from approximately 19% to 4873%.
changes in these projections could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company's reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values. based on this sensitivity analysis, the company did not identify any goodwill impairment. due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit's fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis.
the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. the company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues from our most recent business and strategic plans, and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset. without exception, the estimated fair values exceed the carrying value for each of the company's indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the fourth quarter of 2016, the annual testing date.
income taxes income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements. significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in the current year and future returns. deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards. although we believe our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. to the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. the provision for income taxes includes the impact of uncertain tax benefits that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.
significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
we record uncertain tax benefits on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the positions and (2) for those tax positions that meet the "more-likely-than-not" recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.

safe harbor cautionary statement regarding forward-looking information this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contains forward-looking statements, as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, directly and indirectly relating to earnings, growth opportunities, acquisitions and divestitures, product sales, capital expenditures, pension matters, stock option compensation expense, the credit facility, interest expense, severance and relocation costs, environmental remediation cost, stock repurchases, taxes, exchange rate fluctuations and strategic plans. all statements made in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation that are not historical in nature should be considered forward-looking. actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
many factors could change the anticipated results, including: disruptions in the global economy; changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics, instrumentation, digital imaging, energy exploration and production, commercial aviation, semiconductor and communications markets; funding, continuation and award of government programs; and cuts to defense spending resulting from existing and future deficit reduction measures; risks associated with our pending acquisition of e2v, including the failure to satisfy closing conditions and the failure to successfully integrate the business; impacts from the united kingdom's decision to exit the european union; uncertainties related to the policies of the new u.s. presidential administration; and threats to the security of our confidential and proprietary information, including cyber security threats. continued lower oil and natural gas prices, as well as instability in the middle east or other oil producing regions, and new regulations or restrictions relating to energy production, including with respect to hydraulic fracturing could further negatively affect our businesses that supply the oil and gas industry. increasing fuel costs could negatively affect the markets of our commercial aviation businesses. in addition, financial market fluctuations affect the value of our pension assets. changes in the policies of u.s. and foreign governments could result, over time, in reductions or realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the company participates.
while teledyne's growth strategy includes possible acquisitions, including the pending e2v transaction, we cannot provide any assurance as to when, if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made. acquisitions involve various inherent risks, such as, among others, our ability to integrate acquired businesses, retain customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies. there are additional risks associated with acquiring, owning and operating businesses outside of the united states, including those arising from u.s. and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations.
we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls, disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. while we believe our control systems are effective, there are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.
additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements is contained beginning on page 13 of this form 10-k under the caption "risk factors; cautionary statement as to forward-looking statements." forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as "estimate", "project", "predict", "believes" or "expect", that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or otherwise.

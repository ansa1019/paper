item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k in evaluating us and our common stock. some of these risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate, while others relate to the ownership of our common stock.
our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks, and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
risks relating to our business a substantial or extended decline in refining and marketing gross margins would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could materially and adversely impact our future rate of growth, the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend.
our operating results, cash flows, future rate of growth, the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products. the measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, or crack spread, is commonly used by the industry as a proxy for refining and marketing gross margins. historically, refining and marketing gross margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile. our margins from the sale of gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions, including the price of crude oil. we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine. the price of crude oil and the price at which we can sell our refined products may fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market conditions. any overall change in crack spreads will impact our refining and marketing gross margins. many of the factors influencing a change in crack spreads and refining and marketing gross margins are beyond our control. these factors include:
•   worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and refined products;
•   the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks to be manufactured into refined products;
•   the prices realized for refined products;
•   utilization rates of refineries;
•   natural gas and electricity supply costs incurred by refineries;
•   the ability of the members of opec to agree to and maintain production controls;
•   political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions;
•   local weather conditions;
•   seasonality of demand in our marketing area due to increased highway traffic in the spring and summer months;
•   natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes;
•   the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy;
•   domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and
•   local, regional, national and worldwide economic conditions.
some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. the longer-term effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing gross margins are uncertain. we purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks weeks before we refine them and sell the refined products. price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results. we also purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers. price changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
lower refining and marketing gross margins may reduce the amount of refined products we produce, which may reduce our revenues, income from operations and cash flows. significant reductions in refining and marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures, impair the carrying value of our assets (such as property, plant and equipment, inventory or goodwill), decrease or eliminate our share repurchase activity and our base dividend.
29
our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. failure to manage risks associated with business interruptions could adversely impact our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds, unplanned maintenance or unplanned events such as explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents, power outages, severe weather, labor disputes, or other natural or man-made disasters, such as acts of terrorism. for example, pipelines provide a nearly-exclusive form of transportation of crude oil to, or refined products from, some of our refineries. in such instances, a prolonged interruption in service of such a pipeline could materially and adversely affect the operations, profitability and cash flows of the impacted refinery.
explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities.
we do not insure against all potential losses, and, therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.
we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many, but not all, potential liabilities arising from operating hazards. uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards, including but not limited to, explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations, could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we also have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates.
we rely on the performance of our information technology systems, the failure of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we are heavily dependent on our information technology systems and network infrastructure and maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. these information systems involve data network and telecommunications, internet access and website functionality, and various computer hardware equipment and software applications, including those that are critical to the safe operation of our business. these systems and infrastructure are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, software viruses or other malware, power failures, cyber-attacks and other events. we also face various other cyber-security threats, including threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable. to protect against such attempts of unauthorized access or attack, we have implemented infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans. there can be no guarantee such plans, to the extent they are in place, will be effective.
the retail market is diverse and highly competitive, and very aggressive competition could adversely impact our business.
we face strong competition in the market for the sale of retail gasoline, diesel fuel and merchandise. our competitors include outlets owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers, and other well-recognized national or regional retail outlets, often selling gasoline or merchandise at very competitive prices. several non-traditional retailers such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants are in the retail business. these non-traditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the transportation fuels market and we expect their market share to grow. because of their diversity, integration of operations, experienced management and greater financial resources, these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market. in addition, these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts, both at the pump and in the store, to encourage in-store merchandise sales. these activities by our competitors could pressure us to offer similar discounts, adversely affecting our profit margins. additionally, the loss of market share by our convenience stores to these and other retailers relating to either gasoline or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the development, availability and marketing of alternative and competing fuels in the retail market could adversely impact our business. we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel needs of our consumers. increased competition from these alternatives as a result of governmental regulations, technological advances and consumer demand could have an impact on pricing and demand for our products and our profitability.
30
we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil and refined products.
we utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries. in addition to our own operational risks discussed above, we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines, railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, governmental regulations or third-party actions. a prolonged disruption of the ability of the pipelines, railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products to or from one or more of our refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we may incur losses to our business as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions.
we currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to enter into these types of transactions in the future. a failure of a futures commission merchant or counterparty to perform would affect these transactions. to the extent the instruments we utilize to manage these exposures are not effective, we may incur losses related to the ineffective portion of the derivative transaction or costs related to moving the derivative positions to another futures commission merchant or counterparty once a failure has occurred.
we have significant debt obligations; therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile, a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us, or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally.
at december 31, 2016, our total debt obligations for borrowed money and capital lease obligations were $11.1 billion, including $4.9 billion of obligations of mplx. we may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future.
our indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences, including:
•   increasing our vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory and industry conditions;
•   limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;
•   limiting our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders;
•   limiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and
•   requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and other purposes.
a decrease in our debt or commercial credit capacity, including unsecured credit extended by third-party suppliers, or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and/or limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we have a trade receivables securitization facility that provides liquidity of up to $750 million depending on the amount of eligible domestic trade accounts receivables. in periods of lower prices, we may not have sufficient eligible accounts receivables to support full availability of this facility.
historic or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate.
we currently are defending litigation and anticipate we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. our operations, including those of mplx, and those of our predecessors could expose us to litigation and civil claims by private plaintiffs for alleged damages related to contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, products liability, consumer credit or privacy laws, product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. while an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us, in class-action litigation, large classes of plaintiffs may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages. attorneys general and other government officials may pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims, including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages. we are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future. if we are not able to successfully defend such litigation, it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, plaintiffs in litigation may also seek injunctive relief
31
which, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
a portion of our workforce is unionized, and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
approximately 36 percent of our refining employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. certain hourly employees at our canton, catlettsburg, galveston bay and texas city refineries are represented by the united steel, paper and forestry, rubber, manufacturing, energy, allied industrial and service workers union under labor agreements that are due to expire in 2019. the international brotherhood of teamsters represents certain hourly employees at our detroit refinery under a labor agreement that is also scheduled to expire in 2019. in addition, they represent certain hourly employees at speedway under agreements that cover certain outlets in new york and new jersey that expire on march 14, 2019 and june 30, 2019, respectively. these contracts may be renewed at an increased cost to us. in addition, we have experienced, or may experience, work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements. any prolonged work stoppages disrupting operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership, mplx, which may involve a greater exposure to certain legal liabilities than existed under our historic business operations.
one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of mplx, a publicly traded master limited partnership. our control of the general partner of mplx may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to mplx. any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
if foreign investment in us or mplx exceeds certain levels, mplx could be prohibited from operating inland river vessels, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the shipping act of 1916 and merchant marine act of 1920, which we refer to collectively as the maritime laws, generally require that vessels engaged in u.s. coastwise trade be owned by u.s. citizens. among other requirements to establish citizenship, entities that own such vessels must be owned at least 75 percent by u.s. citizens. if we fail to maintain compliance with the maritime laws, mplx would be prohibited from operating vessels in the u.s. inland waters. such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we are subject to certain continuing contingent liabilities of marathon oil relating to taxes and other matters and to potential liabilities pursuant to the tax sharing agreement and separation and distribution agreement we entered into with marathon oil that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
although the spinoff occurred in mid-2011, certain liabilities of marathon oil could become our obligations. for example, under the internal revenue code of 1986 (the "code") and related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the spinoff is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period. in connection with the spinoff, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with marathon oil that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group between us and marathon oil. however, if marathon oil is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes. other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities.
also pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, following the spinoff we are responsible generally for all taxes attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries, whether accruing before, on or after the spinoff. we also agreed to be responsible for, and indemnify marathon oil with respect to, all taxes arising as a result of the spinoff (or certain internal restructuring transactions) failing to qualify as transactions under sections 368(a) and 355 of the code for u.s. federal income tax purposes to the extent such tax liability arises as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation by us or certain affiliates made in connection with the issuance of the private letter ruling relating to the spinoff or in the tax sharing agreement. in addition, we agreed to indemnify marathon oil for specified tax-related liabilities associated with our 2005 acquisition of the minority interest in our refining joint venture from ashland inc. our indemnification obligations to marathon oil and its subsidiaries, officers and directors are not limited or subject to any cap. if we are required to indemnify marathon oil and its subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors under the tax sharing agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. at this time, we cannot precisely quantify the amount of these liabilities that have been assumed pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, and there can be no assurances as to their final amounts.
32
also, in connection with the spinoff, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with marathon oil that provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions that were required to affect the spinoff, certain conditions to the spinoff and provisions governing the relationship between our company and marathon oil with respect to and resulting from the spinoff. among other things, the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our downstream business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the spinoff, as well as certain obligations of marathon oil assumed by us. our obligations to indemnify marathon oil under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement could subject us to substantial liabilities. marathon oil also agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities retained by marathon oil, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from marathon oil will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, that marathon oil will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or that marathon oil's insurers will cover us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the spinoff. moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from marathon oil or its insurers any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. the tax liabilities and underlying liabilities in the event marathon oil is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations described in this paragraph could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.
we may not realize the growth opportunities and commercial synergies that are anticipated from the markwest merger.
the benefits that are expected to result from the markwest merger will depend, in part, on mplx's ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and commercial synergies as a result of the markwest merger. mplx's success in realizing these growth opportunities and commercial synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of mplx and markwest. there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition as sizable as markwest. the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of mplx and markwest. members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company, maintain relationships with employees, customers or suppliers, attract new customers and develop new strategies. if senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer. there can be no assurance that mplx will successfully or cost-effectively integrate markwest. the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
even if mplx is able to integrate markwest successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and commercial synergies that we currently expect from this integration, and we cannot guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within anticipated time frames or at all. for example, mplx may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs. moreover, mplx may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of markwest. while it is anticipated that certain expenses will be incurred to achieve commercial synergies, such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately, and may exceed current estimates. accordingly, the benefits from the markwest merger may be offset by costs incurred to, or delays in, integrating the businesses.
significant acquisitions in the future will involve the integration of new assets or businesses and present substantial risks that could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.
significant future transactions involving the addition of new assets or businesses will present potential risks, which may include, among others:
•   inaccurate assumptions about future synergies, revenues, capital expenditures and operating costs;
•   an inability to successfully integrate assets or businesses we acquire;
•   a decrease in our liquidity resulting from using a portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement to finance transactions;
•   a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance transactions;
•   the assumption of unknown environmental and other liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;
•   the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; and
•   the incurrence of other significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges.
33
a significant decrease or delay in oil and natural gas production in mplx's areas of operation, whether due to sustained declines in oil, natural gas and ngl prices, natural declines in well production, or otherwise, may adversely affect mplx's business, results of operations and financial condition, and could reduce mplx's ability to make distributions to us.
a significant portion of mplx's operations are dependent upon production from oil and natural gas reserves and wells, which will naturally decline over time, which means that mplx's cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time. to maintain or increase throughput levels and the utilization rate of mplx's facilities, mplx must continually obtain new oil, natural gas, ngl and refined product supplies, which depends in part on the level of successful drilling activity near its facilities.
we have no control over the level of drilling activity in the areas of mplx's operations, the amount of reserves associated with the wells or the rate at which production from a well will decline. in addition, we have no control over producers or their production decisions, which are affected by, among other things, prevailing and projected energy prices, drilling costs per mcf or barrel, demand for hydrocarbons, operational challenges, access to downstream markets, the level of reserves, geological considerations, governmental regulations and the availability and cost of capital. because of these factors, even if new oil or natural gas reserves are discovered in areas served by mplx assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. if mplx is not able to obtain new supplies of oil or natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells, throughput on mplx pipelines and the utilization rates of mplx facilities would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on mplx's business, results of operations and financial condition and could reduce mplx's ability to make distributions to us.
decreases in energy prices can decrease drilling activity, production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves. the prices for oil, natural gas and ngls depend upon factors beyond our control, including global and local demand, production levels, changes in interstate pipeline gas quality specifications, imports and exports, seasonality and weather conditions, economic and political conditions domestically and internationally and governmental regulations. sustained periods of low prices could result in producers also significantly curtailing or limiting their oil and gas drilling operations which could substantially delay the production and delivery of volumes of oil, gas and ngls to mplx's facilities and adversely affect mplx's revenues and cash available for distribution to us. this impact may also be exacerbated due to the extent of mplx's commodity-based contracts, which are more directly impacted by changes in gas and ngl prices than its fee-based contracts due to frac spread exposure and may result in operating losses when natural gas becomes more expensive on a btu equivalent basis than ngl products. in addition, mplx's purchase and resale of gas and ngls in the ordinary course exposes mplx to significant risk of volatility in gas or ngl prices due to the potential difference in the time of the purchases and sales and the potential difference in the price associated with each transaction, and direct exposure may also occur naturally as a result of mplx's production processes. the significant fluctuation and decline in natural gas, ngl and oil prices currently occurring has adversely impacted mplx's unit price, thereby increasing its distribution yield and cost of capital. such impacts could adversely impact mplx's ability to execute its long‐term organic growth projects, satisfy obligations to its customers and make distributions to unitholders at intended levels, and may also result in non-cash impairments of long-lived assets or goodwill or other-than-temporary non-cash impairments of our equity method investments.
our recently announced strategic actions designed to enhance shareholder value may not deliver the anticipated benefits.
in january 2017, we announced updates to our previously announced strategic actions designed to enhance shareholder value, including the significant acceleration of dropdowns of midstream assets into mplx and the expected exchange of our economic interests in the general partner, including incentive distribution rights, for newly issued mplx common units in conjunction with the completion of such dropdowns. we may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits of these actions as we may not be able to implement the announced strategic actions due to: the inability to agree with the mplx conflicts committee with respect to the value attributed to assets identified for dropdown; the adequacy of mplx's capital and liquidity, including, but not limited to, mplx's access to debt to fund the anticipated dropdowns on commercially reasonable terms; and the time, cost and ability to obtain requisite approvals and regulatory clearances, including tax clearance. in addition, the market price of our common stock could decline if securities or industry analysts or our investors disagree with these strategic actions or the way we implement such actions. accordingly, even if we are able to implement some or all of the strategic actions successfully, there is no assurance that these actions will be reflected in the market price of our stock to the extent currently anticipated by management.
34
significant stockholders may attempt to effect changes at our company or acquire control over our company, which could impact the pursuit of business strategies and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
our stockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance stockholder proposals or otherwise attempt to affect changes or acquire control over our company. campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company. responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies. as a result, stockholder campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
risks relating to our industry changes in environmental or other laws or regulations may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin and may result in substantial capital expenditures and operating costs that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
various laws and regulations are expected to impose increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our operations, which may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin. laws and regulations expected to become more stringent relate to the following:
•   the emission or discharge of materials into the environment,
•   solid and hazardous waste management,
•   pollution prevention,
•   greenhouse gas emissions,
•   characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels,
•   public and employee safety and health, and
•   facility security.
the specific impact of laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas, crude oil and feedstock sources and production processes. we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
because the issue of climate change continues to receive scientific and political attention, there is the potential for further laws and regulations that could affect our operations. the u.s. pledge in 2009, as part of the copenhagen accord, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 remains in effect and was reaffirmed in the president's 2013 climate action plan. the 2015 paris un climate change conference agreement aims to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below two degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels. in november 2016, the obama administration released its strategy for "deep de-carbonization," which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050. the u.s. climate change strategy and implementation of that strategy through legislation and regulation may change under the new administration; therefore, the impact to our industry and operations due to greenhouse gas regulation is unknown at this time.
in october 2015, the epa finalized regulations to reduce carbon emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed power plants (new source performance standards) and from existing power plants (existing source performance standards; also known as the clean power plan). through the regulations, the epa is requiring a reduction in nationwide carbon emissions from the power generation sector by 32 percent below 2005 levels. these standards could increase our electricity costs and potentially reduce the reliability of our electricity supply. in february 2016, the u.s. supreme court stayed implementation of the clean power plan until the legal challenge filed by several states and industry could be heard by the courts.
35
the obama administration developed the social cost of carbon ("scc"), which is to be used by the epa and other federal agencies in regulatory cost-benefit analyses to take into account alleged broad economic consequences associated with changes to emissions of greenhouse gases. the scc was first issued in 2010. in 2013, the obama administration significantly increased the estimate to $36 per ton. in response to the regulated community and congress' critiques of how the scc was developed, the office of management and budget ("omb") provided an opportunity to comment on the scc. in july 2015, the omb issued a response to comments and a revised technical support document explaining adjustments to the scc calculations. additionally, in august 2016, the white house council on environmental quality issued its final guidance to federal agencies on assessing a project's impact to climate change under the national environmental policy act by estimating the greenhouse gas emissions from the project, including using the scc when analyzing costs and benefits of a project. while the impact of a higher scc in future regulations is not known at this time, it may result in increased costs to our operations.
an article on the social cost of methane has also been published and was used by the epa in its regulatory impact analysis of the proposed emission standards for new and modified sources in the oil and natural gas sector. these regulations were proposed pursuant to president obama's strategy to reduce methane emissions as part of the administration's efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. the finalization of these regulations could directly impact mplx by creating delays in the construction and installation of new facilities due to more stringent permitting requirements, increasing costs to reduce ghg emissions or requiring aggregation of emissions from separate facilities for permitting purposes. these regulations may also impact us by increasing the costs of domestic crude supplies.
in the absence of federal legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, states may become more active in regulating greenhouse gas emissions. these measures include state actions to develop statewide or regional programs to impose emission reductions. these measures may also include low carbon fuel standards, such as the california program. in addition, private party litigation is pending against federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken. these actions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls and costs to administer any carbon trading or tax programs implemented. although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for the products we sell and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities.
in october 2015, the epa reduced the primary (health) ozone national ambient air quality standards ("naaqs") to 70 ppb from the prior ozone level of 75 ppb. the epa is expected to finalize new ozone attainment and nonattainment designations by late 2017, using 2014-2016 air quality monitor data. the lower primary ozone standard may not by attainable in some areas and could result in the cancellation or delay of capital projects at our facilities or increased costs related to an increase in the production of low reid vapor pressure (rvp) gasoline.
the eisa establishes increases in fuel mileage standards and contains a second renewable fuel standard commonly referred to as rfs2. increases in fuel mileage standards and the increased use of renewable fuels (including ethanol and advanced biofuels) may reduce demand for refined products. governmental regulations encouraging the use of new or alternative fuels could also pose a competitive threat to our operations. specifically, the rfs2 required the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the u.s. to reach 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. the rfs2 presents production and logistics challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining industries, and may continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use. gasoline consumption has been lower than forecasted by the epa, which has led to concerns that the renewable fuel volumes may not be met. the 2017 renewable fuel standards were finalized and published on november 23, 2016. the final standards are lower than the statutory requirements but nevertheless result in volumes that breach the ethanol "blendwall." the advanced biofuels program, a subset of the rfs2 requirements, creates uncertainties and presents challenges of supply, and may require that we and other refiners and other obligated parties purchase credits from the epa to meet our obligations.
tax incentives and other subsidies have also made renewable fuels more competitive with refined products than they otherwise would have been, which may further reduce refined product margins. the tax incentives and subsidies are causing uncertainties because they have expired and been reinstituted retroactively. the biodiesel credit, for example, expired at the end of 2016 and there is uncertainty if it will be reinstituted.
on march 3, 2014, the epa signed the final tier 3 fuel standards. the final tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts ppm beginning in calendar year 2017. in addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm, while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. we anticipate that we will spend an estimated $650 million between 2014 and 2019 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards, which includes estimated capital expenditures of approximately $200 million in 2017.
36
federal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could delay or impede producer's gas production or result in reduced volumes available for mplx to gather, process and fractionate. mplx does not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, but it does provide gathering, processing and fractionation services with respect to natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by its customers as a result of such operations. if federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells in shale formations and increase producers' costs of compliance.
severe weather events may adversely affect our facilities and ongoing operations.
for a variety of reasons, natural and/or anthropogenic, some members of the scientific community believe that climate changes could occur that could have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.
plans we may have to expand existing assets or construct new assets are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the future development, transportation and use of carbon-based fuels. such risks could adversely impact our business and ability to realize certain growth strategies.
our anticipated growth and planned expenditures are based upon the assumption that societal sentiment will continue to enable and existing regulations will remain intact to allow for the future development, transportation and use of carbon-based fuels. a portion of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to expand existing assets and to construct additional assets. however, policy decisions relating to the production, refining, transportation and marketing of carbon-based fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence of environmental and other special interest groups. the construction of new refinery processing units or crude oil or refined products pipelines, or the extension or expansion of existing assets, involve numerous political and legal uncertainties, many of which may cause significant delays or cost increases and most of which are beyond our control. delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results, thereby limiting our ability to grow and generate cash flows.
large capital projects can take many years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date, negatively impacting project returns. if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:
•   denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits;
•   unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor;
•   disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials;
•   adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers;
•   shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;
•   market-related increases in a project's debt or equity financing costs; and
•   nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors.
any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects. if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs, or if market conditions change, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

the availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce profitability and refining and marketing gross margins.
the profitability of our operations depends largely on the difference between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products. a portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies, including suppliers from canada, the middle east and various other international locations. the market for crude oil and other feedstocks is largely a world market. we are, therefore, subject to the attendant political, geographic and economic risks of such a market. if one or more major supply sources were temporarily or permanently eliminated, we believe adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our operations, sales of refined products and refining and marketing gross margins could be adversely affected, materially and adversely impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
worldwide political and economic developments could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in addition to impacting crude oil and other feedstock supplies, political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways. hostilities in the middle east or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the u.s. and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products, ngls and natural gas. additionally, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult and/or costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. additionally, tax policy, legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability. for example, the u.s. government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products, ngls, natural gas or the conduct of business with certain foreign countries.
compliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales and use, payroll, franchise, withholding and property taxes. new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. for example, the u.s. house of representatives republican leadership released a tax reform blueprint proposing the replacement of the current corporate income tax with a destination-based cash flow tax. because the value of our crude oil imports exceed the value of our refined product exports, this proposal could have a material adverse effect on our u.s. income tax liabilities. additionally, many tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities, and such audits could subject us to interest and penalties.
terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities or that impact our customers or the markets we serve could adversely affect our business.
the u.s. government has issued warnings that energy assets in general, including the nation's refining, pipeline and terminal infrastructure, may be future targets of terrorist organizations. the threat of terrorist attacks has subjected our operations to increased risks. any future terrorist attacks on our facilities, those of our customers and, in some cases, those of other pipelines, could have a material adverse effect on our business. similarly, any future terrorist attacks that severely disrupt the markets we serve could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
risks relating to ownership of our common stock provisions in our corporate governance documents could operate to delay or prevent a change in control of our company, dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity.
the existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable. these include provisions:
•   providing that our board of directors fixes the number of members of the board;
•   providing for the division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered terms;
•   providing that only our board of directors may fill board vacancies;
•   limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;
•   prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;
38
•   establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;
•   establishing supermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and stockholder proposals for amendments to our amended and restated bylaws;
•   providing that our directors may only be removed for cause;
•   authorizing a large number of shares of common stock that are not yet issued, which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us; and
•   authorizing the issuance of "blank check" preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt.
we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors time to assess any acquisition proposal, and are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. however, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition.
our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.
finally, to facilitate compliance with the maritime laws, our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by non-u.s. citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 percent of the outstanding shares. we may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by non-u.s. citizens to exceed 23 percent. our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock. these limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to non-u.s. citizens due to the limitations on ownership by non-u.s. citizens. any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.

corporate overview we are an independent petroleum refining and marketing, retail and midstream company. overall, we are one of the largest independent petroleum product refining, marketing, retail and transportation businesses in the united states and the largest east of the mississippi.
we currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the united states, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.8 mmbpcd. our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the midwest, northeast, east coast, southeast and gulf coast regions of the united states. we distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest terminal operations in the united states and a combination of mpc-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area.
we have two strong retail brands: speedway® and marathon®. we believe that speedway llc, a wholly-owned subsidiary, operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the united states, with approximately 2,730 convenience stores in 21 states throughout the midwest, east coast and southeast. the marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states, and is available through approximately 5,500 retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 19 states.
through our ownership interests in mplx and its wholly-owned subsidiary, markwest, we are one of the largest processors of natural gas in the united states, the largest processor and fractionator in the marcellus and utica shale regions and we distribute refined products through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges. our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas and ngls from some of the largest supply basins in the united states to domestic and international markets. our midstream gathering and processing operations include: natural gas gathering, processing and transportation; and ngl gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing. our assets include approximately 7,500 mmcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and 500 mbpd of fractionation capacity as of december 31, 2016. we also own 5,600 miles of gas gathering and ngl pipelines and have ownership interests in more than 50 gas processing plants, more than 10 ngl fractionation facilities and two condensate stabilization facilities. as of december 31, 2016, we owned, leased or had ownership interests in approximately 8,400 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas.
we revised our operating segment presentation in the first quarter of 2016 in connection with the contribution of our inland marine business to mplx. in previous periods, our inland marine business and our investment in an ocean vessel joint venture, crowley ocean partners, were presented within our refining & marketing segment. they are now presented in our midstream segment. comparable prior period information has been recast to reflect our revised segment presentation. we plan additional dropdowns of mlp-qualifying assets to mplx in 2017 and would expect changes to our segment reporting in connection with these transactions.
our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: refining & marketing; speedway; and midstream. each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer. see item 1. business for additional information on our segments.
•   refining &amp; marketing - refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the gulf coast and midwest regions of the united states, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including terminals and trucks that we own or operate. we sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, buyers on the spot market, our speedway business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate marathon® retail outlets.
50
•   speedway - sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the midwest, east coast and southeast.
•   midstream - includes the operations of mplx and certain other related operations. the midstream segment gathers, processes and transports natural gas; gathers, transports, fractionates, stores and markets ngls and transports and stores crude oil and refined products.
strategic actions to enhance shareholder value on january 3, 2017, we announced plans to significantly accelerate the dropdown of assets with an estimated $1.4 billion of mlp-eligible annual ebitda to mplx now expected to be completed in 2017, subject to requisite approvals and regulatory clearances, including tax clearance, and market and other conditions. we expect these dropdowns to be valued consistent with recent industry precedent valuation multiples ranging between 7.0x and 9.0x ebitda, subject to the mplx conflicts committee review process and receipt of customary fairness opinions. we also expect mplx to finance the dropdown transactions with debt and equity in approximately equal proportions in the aggregate for all planned dropdowns of assets. the equity financing is expected to be funded through mplx common units issued to us. in conjunction with the completion of the dropdowns, we also expect to exchange our economic interests in the general partner of mplx, including incentive distribution rights, for newly issued mplx common units. additionally, a special committee of our board of directors, with the assistance of an independent financial advisor, will conduct a full and thorough review of speedway to ensure optimum value is being delivered to shareholders over the long term. we expect to provide an update on the review by mid-2017. this significant acceleration of dropdowns and other announced strategic actions are designed to further highlight the substantial value embedded in our integrated businesses.
executive summary results select results for 2016 and 2015 are reflected in the following table.
(in millions, except per share data)   2016                                                    2015
income from operations by segment refining &amp; marketing                                             $1,543              $4,086

total                                                                $2,378              $4,692
net income attributable to mpc                                       $1,174              $2,852
net income attributable to mpc per diluted share                      $2.21               $5.26
net income attributable to mpc decreased $1.68 billion, or $3.05 per diluted share, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to reduced results from our refining & marketing segment.
refining & marketing segment income from operations decreased in 2016 compared to 2015. segment income in 2015 includes a $345 million non-cash charge related to the company's lcm inventory reserve. due to increased refined product prices in 2016, this inventory reserve was completely reversed resulting in a non-cash benefit to segment income of $345 million. the favorable lcm inventory adjustment variance was more than offset by the unfavorable effects of lower crack spreads and higher direct operating costs due to refinery turnarounds.
speedway segment income from operations increased in 2016 compared to 2015. segment income in 2015 includes a $25 million non-cash charge related to the company's lcm inventory reserve. due to increased refined product prices in 2016, this inventory reserve was completely reversed resulting in a non-cash benefit to segment income of $25 million. in addition to the favorable lcm inventory adjustment variance, the remaining increase during the year was primarily due to higher merchandise gross margin and gains from asset sales, partially offset by lower gasoline and distillate gross margins.
midstream segment income from operations increased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the inclusion of markwest's operating results following the merger with mplx on december 4, 2015 (as discussed below), as well as earnings from new and existing pipeline and marine equity investments.
51
items not allocated to segments in 2016 includes non-cash impairment charges totaling $486 million, which included $267 million related to our equity method investment in the sandpiper pipeline project resulting from the indefinite deferral of this project, $130 million related to the goodwill recognized in connection with the markwest merger and $89 million related to an mplx equity method investment. items not allocated to segments in 2015 includes an impairment charge of $144 million related to the cancellation of the roux project.
mplx lp mplx is a diversified, growth-oriented publicly traded master limited partnership originally formed by us to own, operate, develop and acquire midstream energy infrastructure assets. mplx is engaged in the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas; the gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing of ngls; and the gathering, transportation and storage of crude oil and refined petroleum products. on december 4, 2015, mplx merged with markwest, whereby markwest became a wholly-owned subsidiary of mplx. markwest is engaged in the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas and the gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing of ngls.
as of december 31, 2016, we owned a 25.5 percent interest in mplx, including a two percent general partner interest. this ownership percentage reflects the conversion of the mplx class b units in july 2017 at 1.09 to 1.00. mplx is a vie because the limited partners of mplx do not have substantive kick-out or substantive participating rights over the general partner. we are the primary beneficiary of mplx because in addition to significant economic interest, we also have the power, through our 100 percent ownership of the general partner, to control the decisions that most significantly impact mplx. we therefore consolidate mplx and record a noncontrolling interest for the 74.5 percent interest owned by the public. the components of our noncontrolling interest consist of equity-based noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest. the redeemable noncontrolling interest relates to mplx's preferred units, discussed below.
the creditors of mplx do not have recourse to mpc's general credit through guarantees or other financial arrangements. the assets of mplx are the property of mplx and cannot be used to satisfy the obligations of mpc.
dropdowns to mplx on march 1, 2014, we sold mplx a 13 percent interest in mplx pipe line holdings llc ("pipe line holdings") for $310 million. mplx financed this transaction with $40 million of cash on-hand and $270 million of borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility.
on december 1, 2014, we sold and contributed interests in pipe line holdings totaling 30.5 percent to mplx for $600 million in cash and 2.9 million mplx common units valued at $200 million. mplx financed the sales portion of this transaction with $600 million of borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility.
on december 4, 2015, we sold our remaining 0.5 percent interest in pipe line holdings to mplx for $12 million. as a result, mplx now owns 100 percent of pipe line holdings.
the sales and contribution of our interests in pipe line holdings to mplx resulted in a change of our ownership in pipe line holdings, but not a change in control. we accounted for these sales as transactions between entities under common control and did not record a gain or loss.
on march 31, 2016, we contributed our inland marine business to mplx in exchange for 23 million common units and 460 thousand general partner units. the number of units we received from mplx was determined by dividing $600 million by the volume weighted average nyse price of mplx common units for the 10 trading days preceding march 14, 2016, pursuant to the membership interests contribution agreement. we also agreed to waive first-quarter 2016 common unit distributions, idrs and general partner distributions with respect to the common units issued in this transaction. the contribution of our inland marine business was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control and we did not record a gain or loss.
on december 5, 2016, our board of directors authorized us to offer up to 100 percent of mplx terminals llc ("mplx terminals"), hardin street transportation llc ("hardin street transportation") and woodhaven cavern llc ("woodhaven cavern") to mplx. mplx terminals owns and operates light products terminals. hardin street transportation owns and operates various private crude oil and refined product pipeline systems and associated storage tanks. woodhaven cavern owns and operates butane and propane storage caverns. the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, pending requisite approvals.
52
reorganization transactions on september 1, 2016, mpc, mplx and various affiliates initiated a series of reorganization transactions in order to simplify mplx's ownership structure and its financial and tax reporting. in connection with these transactions, mpc contributed $225 million to mplx, and all of the issued and outstanding mplx class a units, all of which were held by markwest hydrocarbon, a wholly-owned subsidiary of mplx, were exchanged for newly issued common units representing limited partner interests in mplx. the simple average of the closing prices of mplx common units for the last 10 trading days prior to september 1, 2016 was used for purposes of these transactions. as a result of these transactions, mpc increased its ownership interest in mplx by 7 million mplx common units, or approximately 1 percent.
private placement of preferred units on may 13, 2016, mplx completed the private placement of approximately 30.8 million 6.5 percent series a convertible preferred units (the "mplx preferred units") at a cash price of $32.50 per unit. the aggregate net proceeds of approximately $984 million from the sale of the mplx preferred units was used for capital expenditures, repayment of debt and general partnership purposes.
the mplx preferred units rank senior to all mplx common units with respect to distributions and rights upon liquidation. the holders of the mplx preferred units are entitled to receive quarterly distributions equal to $0.528125 per unit commencing for the quarter ended june 30, 2016, with a prorated amount from the date of issuance. following the second anniversary of the issuance of the mplx preferred units, the holders of the mplx preferred units will receive as a distribution the greater of $0.528125 per unit or the amount of per unit distributions paid to common units. the mplx preferred units are convertible into mplx common units on a one for one basis after three years, at the purchasers' option, and after four years at mplx's option, subject to certain conditions.
the mplx preferred units are considered redeemable securities due to the existence of redemption provisions upon a deemed liquidation event which is considered outside our control. therefore they are presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets. we have recorded the mplx preferred units at fair value as of their issuance date, net of issuance costs. since the mplx preferred units are not currently redeemable and not probable of becoming redeemable in the future, adjustment to the initial carrying amount is not necessary and would only be required if it becomes probable that the security would become redeemable.
public offerings on december 8, 2014, mplx completed a public offering of 3.5 million common units at a price to the public of $66.68 per mplx common unit, with net proceeds of $221 million. mplx used the net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under its bank revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes.
on february 12, 2015, mplx completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of four percent unsecured senior notes due february 15, 2025 (the "senior notes"). the senior notes were offered at a price to the public of 99.64 percent of par. the net proceeds of this offering were used to for general corporate purposes, including dropdowns.
on february 10, 2017, mplx completed a public offering of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.125% unsecured senior notes due march 2027 (the "mplx 2027 senior notes") and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.200% unsecured senior notes due march 2047 (the "mplx 2047 senior notes"). mplx intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general partnership purposes, which may include, from time to time, acquisitions (including the previously announced planned dropdown of assets from mpc) and capital expenditures.
atm program on august 4, 2016, mplx entered into a second amended and restated distribution agreement (the "distribution agreement") providing for the continuous issuance of common units, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of any offerings (such continuous offering program, or at-the-market program, referred to as the "atm program"). mplx expects to use the net proceeds from sales under the atm program for general partnership purposes including repayment of debt and funding for acquisitions, working capital requirements and capital expenditures.
during 2016, mplx issued an aggregate of 26 million common units under the atm program, generating net proceeds of approximately $776 million. as of december 31, 2016, $717 million of common units remains available for issuance through the atm program under the distribution agreement.
53
distributions from mplx the following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from mplx during 2016 and 2015.
(in millions)            2016                                              2015
cash distributions received from mplx:
general partner distributions, including idrs        $190               $21
limited partner distributions                         142                97
total                                                $332              $118
the market value of the 86.6 million mplx common units we owned at december 31, 2016 was $3.0 billion based on the december 31, 2016 closing unit price of $34.62. as mentioned in the strategic actions to enhance shareholder value section above, we believe there is substantial value in our economic interests in the general partner of mplx and expect to exchange these economic interests for newly issued mplx common units in conjunction with completion of our dropdowns to highlight and capture that value.
on january 25, 2017, mplx declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.52 per common unit, which was payable february 14, 2017. as a result, mplx made distributions totaling $243 million to its limited and general partners. mpc's portion of this distribution was approximately $102 million, $57 million for its general partner interests including idrs and $45 million for its limited partner units.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 4 for additional information on mplx.
acquisitions and investments on february 13, 2017, mplx announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement with enbridge pipelines (ozark) llc ("enbridge ozark"), under which an affiliate of pipe line holdings has agreed to purchase the ozark pipeline for approximately $220 million from enbridge ozark. the ozark pipeline is a 433-mile, 22-inch crude oil pipeline originating in cushing, oklahoma, and terminating in wood river, illinois, capable of transporting approximately 230 mbpd. the purchase transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.
on february 6, 2017, mplx announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, markwest, and antero midstream partners l.p. ("antero midstream") formed a strategic joint venture to support the development of antero resources corporation's extensive marcellus shale acreage in the prolific rich-gas corridor of west virginia. in connection with this transaction, markwest contributed approximately $134 million of assets currently under construction at the sherwood complex and antero midstream made an initial capital contribution of approximately $154 million.
in the fourth quarter of 2016, speedway and pilot flying j finalized the formation of a joint venture consisting of 123 travel plazas, primarily in the southeast united states. the new entity, pfj southeast, consisted of 41 existing locations contributed by speedway and 82 locations contributed by pilot flying j, all of which carry either the pilot or flying j brand and are operated by pilot flying j. our non-cash contribution was $272 million based on the book value of the assets we contributed to the joint venture.
on september 1, 2016, enbridge energy partners announced that its affiliate, north dakota pipeline, would withdraw certain pending regulatory applications for the sandpiper pipeline project and that the project would be deferred indefinitely. these decisions were considered to indicate an impairment of the costs capitalized to date on the project. we made contributions of $14 million to north dakota pipeline during the year ended december 31, 2016 and have contributed $301 million since project inception to fund our share of the construction costs for the project. as the operator of north dakota pipeline, which owns the investments made to date in the sandpiper pipeline project, and the entity responsible for maintaining its financial records, enbridge energy partners completed a fixed asset impairment analysis as of august 31, 2016, in accordance with asc topic 360, to determine the fixed asset impairment charge. based on the estimated liquidation value of the fixed assets, an impairment charge was recorded by north dakota pipeline. based on our 37.5 percent ownership of north dakota pipeline, we recognized approximately $267 million of this charge in the third quarter of 2016 through "income (loss) from equity method investments" on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17 to the for information regarding the charge.

on february 15, 2017, mplx closed on the previously announced transaction to acquire a partial, indirect equity interest in the dapl and etcop projects, collectively referred to as the bakken pipeline system, through a joint venture with enbridge energy partners. mplx contributed $500 million of the $2 billion purchase price paid by the joint venture to acquire a 36.75 percent indirect equity interest in the bakken pipeline system from etp and sxl. mplx holds, through a subsidiary, a 25 percent interest in the joint venture, which equates to an approximate 9.2 percent indirect equity interest in the bakken pipeline system. the bakken pipeline system is currently expected to deliver in excess of 470 mbpd of crude oil from the bakken/three forks production area in north dakota to the midwest through patoka, illinois and ultimately to the gulf coast. furthermore, mpc expects to become a committed shipper on the bakken pipeline system under terms of an on-going open season.
in connection with closing the transaction with etp and sxl, enbridge energy partners canceled mpc's transportation services agreement with respect to the sandpiper pipeline project and released mpc from paying any termination fee per that agreement.
we currently have indirect ownership interests in two ocean vessel joint ventures with crowley, which were established to own and operate jones act vessels in petroleum product service. we have invested a total of $189 million in these two ventures as described further below.
in september 2015, we acquired a 50 percent ownership interest in a joint venture, crowley ocean partners, with crowley. the joint venture owns and operates four new jones act product tankers, three of which are leased to mpc. two of the vessels were delivered in 2015 and the remaining two were delivered in 2016. during 2016, we contributed $69 million in connection with the delivery of the third and fourth vessels. we have contributed a total of $141 million for the four vessels.
in may 2016, mpc and crowley formed a new ocean vessel joint venture, crowley coastal partners, in which mpc has a 50 percent ownership interest. mpc and crowley each contributed their 50 percent ownership in crowley ocean partners, discussed above, into crowley coastal partners. in addition, we contributed $48 million in cash and crowley contributed its 100 percent ownership interest in crowley blue water partners to crowley coastal partners. crowley blue water partners is an entity that owns and operates three 750 series atb vessels that are leased to mpc. we account for our 50 percent interest in crowley coastal partners as part of our midstream segment using the equity method of accounting.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 6 for additional information on crowley coastal partners as a vie and note 25 for information regarding our conditional guarantee of the indebtedness of crowley ocean partners and crowley blue water partners.
on december 4, 2015, mplx merged with markwest, whereby markwest became a wholly-owned subsidiary of mplx. each common unit of markwest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the markwest merger was converted into a right to receive 1.09 common units of mplx representing limited partner interests in mplx, plus a one-time cash payment of $6.20 per unit. each class b unit of markwest outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive one class b unit of mplx having substantially similar rights, including conversion and registration rights, and obligations the class b units of markwest had immediately prior to the merger. at closing, we contributed $1.23 billion in cash to mplx to pay the cash consideration to markwest common unitholders. we will contribute an additional total of $50 million in cash to mplx for the cash consideration to be paid upon the conversion of the mplx class b units to mplx common units in equal installments, the first $25 million of which was paid in july 2016 and the second $25 million of which will be paid in july 2017. these contributions are with respect to mpc's existing interests in mplx (including idrs) and not in consideration of new units or other equity interest in mplx. we assigned the total consideration transferred of $8.61 billion, including the $7.33 billion fair value of the equity consideration and the $1.28 billion of cash contributions, to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities and noncontrolling interest assumed in the markwest merger, with the excess recorded as goodwill. during the first quarter of 2016, the preliminary fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed recorded in the 2015 year-end financial statements were revised based on additional analysis. these adjustments to the fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and equity investments, among other items, resulted in an offsetting reduction to goodwill of approximately $241 million. as a result, we recognized total assets acquired of $11.91 billion, including $8.52 billion of property plant and equipment and $2.60 billion of equity investments, and total liabilities and noncontrolling interests assumed of $5.51 billion, including $4.57 billion of assumed debt. goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted due to events or changes in circumstances.
55
mplx recorded an impairment charge of approximately $129 million in the first quarter of 2016 to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill, as adjusted, recorded in connection with the markwest merger. in the second quarter of 2016, mplx completed its purchase price allocation, which resulted in an additional $1 million of impairment expense that would have been recorded in the first quarter of 2016 had the purchase price allocation been completed as of that date. this adjustment to the impairment expense was the result of completing an evaluation of the deferred tax liabilities associated with the markwest merger and their impact on the resulting goodwill that was recognized. see the critical accounting estimates - impairment assessments of long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity investments section for a discussion of recent circumstances which may impact the assessment of this goodwill. our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of markwest operations from the date of the acquisition in the midstream segment.
consistent with our strategy to grow our midstream business, the markwest merger combines one of the nation's largest processors of natural gas and the largest processor and fractionator in the marcellus and utica shale regions with a rapidly growing crude oil and refined products logistics partnership sponsored by mpc. the complementary aspects of the highly diverse asset base of markwest, mplx and mpc provide significant additional opportunities across multiple segments of the hydrocarbon value chain. the combined entity will further markwest's leading midstream presence in the marcellus and utica shales by allowing it to pursue additional midstream projects, which should allow producer customers to achieve superior value for their growing production in these important shale regions.
on september 30, 2014, we acquired from hess all of its retail locations, transport operations and shipper history on various pipelines, including approximately 40 mbpd on colonial pipeline, for $2.82 billion. we refer to these assets as "hess' retail operations and related assets" and substantially all of these assets are part of our speedway segment. this acquisition significantly expanded our speedway presence from nine to 22 states throughout the east coast and southeast consistent with our strategy to grow higher-valued, more stable cash flow businesses. this acquisition also enables us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations, providing an outlet for assured sales from our refining system. the transaction was funded with a combination of debt and available cash. our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results for hess' retail operations and related assets in our speedway segment from the date of the acquisition.
in july 2014, we exercised our option to acquire a 35 percent ownership interest in enbridge inc.'s sax pipeline which runs from flanagan, illinois to patoka, illinois. this option resulted from our agreement to be the anchor shipper on the sax pipeline. during 2016, we made contributions of $32 million to illinois extension pipeline to fund our portion of the construction costs for the sax project. we have contributed $299 million since project inception. the pipeline became operational in december 2015. our investment in the pipeline is included in our midstream segment.
in march 2014, we acquired from chevron raven ridge pipe line company an additional seven percent interest in explorer for $77 million, bringing our ownership interest to 25 percent. due to this increase in our ownership percentage, we now account for our investment in explorer using the equity method of accounting as part of our midstream segment and report explorer as a related party. explorer owns approximately 1,900 miles of refined products pipeline from port arthur, texas to hammond, indiana.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 5 for additional information on these acquisitions and investments.
share repurchases since january 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $10.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $7.44 billion of our common stock, leaving $2.56 billion available for repurchases as of december 31, 2016. under these authorizations, we have acquired 202 million shares at an average cost per share of $36.77.
liquidity as of december 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $887 million and no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our $3.5 billion bank revolving credit facilities or under our $750 million trade receivables securitization facility ("trade receivables facility"). as of december 31, 2016, eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of $684 million under the trade receivable facility. as of december 31, 2016, we do not have any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. we do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facilities. mplx had no borrowings outstanding under its $2 billion revolving credit agreement as of december 31, 2016.

overview of segments refining & marketing refining & marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining & marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs.
our refining & marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. as a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate midwest (chicago) and usgc crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. lls prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of lls crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of three percent residual fuel oil) are used for these crack-spread calculations.
our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. the amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our refining & marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. in general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our refining & marketing gross margin.
future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as u.s. energy policy.
the following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions.
(in millions, after-tax)
lls 6-3-2-1 crack spread sensitivity(a) (per $1.00/barrel change)                        $450

(a)   weighted 40 percent chicago and 60 percent usgc lls 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.
(b)   lls (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: arab light, kuwait, maya, western canadian select and mars].
(c)   assumes approximately 20 percent of crude oil throughput volumes are wti-based domestic crude oil.
(d)   this is consumption based exposure for our refining &amp; marketing segment and does not include the sales exposure for our midstream segment.
in addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the lls to wti differential, our refining & marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as:
•   the selling prices realized for refined products;
•   the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;
•   our refinery yields;
•   the cost of products purchased for resale;
•   the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk; and
57
•   the potential impact of lcm adjustments to inventories in periods of declining prices.
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the lifo inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. at december 31, 2015, costs of inventories on a consolidated basis exceeded market value resulting in an lcm charge to cost of revenues of $370 million, of which $345 million was allocated to our refining & marketing segment. as of june 30, 2016, market value exceeded cost and we reversed the lcm inventory reserve resulting in a benefit to cost of revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016. at december 31, 2016, market values for refined products continue to exceed their cost basis and, therefore, there is no lcm inventory market valuation reserve at the end of the year. based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings. such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover.
refining & marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs, which include turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses. changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. the following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years.

speedway our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the speedway segment profitability. gasoline and distillate prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in supply and demand. numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. padd 2 estimated 2016 gasoline demand grew for the fourth consecutive year to a record level, up 1.8 percent year over year in 2016, and 1.2 percent above the former record set in 2006. continuing economic growth and year-on-year declines in prices supported gasoline demand in most of the u.s., more than offsetting fleet fuel efficiency gains. estimated gasoline demand in padd 1, however, posted a small decline of 0.1 percent year over year in 2016 as prices increased year over year in the last four months of the year-exacerbated by colonial pipeline disruptions in september and late october. distillate demand in 2016 faced enormous headwinds as a much warmer than normal first quarter suppressed heating oil demand and rail traffic (total carloads and intermodal) fell to a six-year low for the year. padd 1 estimated 2016 distillate demand was down 5.8 percent year over year to a four year low, pulled down by a first quarter that was down nearly 15 percent year over year. padd 2 distillate demand is estimated down 2.0 percent year over year, also a four year low. the gross margin on merchandise sold at our convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to speedway's gross margin. more than
58
half of speedway's gross margin was derived from merchandise sales in 2016. speedway's convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items.
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value. costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the lifo inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. as of december 31, 2015, costs of inventories on a consolidated basis exceeded market value resulting in an lcm charge to cost of revenues of $370 million, of which $25 million was allocated to our speedway segment. as of june 30, 2016, market value exceeded cost and we reversed the lcm inventory reserve resulting in a benefit to cost of revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016. as of december 31, 2016, market values for refined products continue to exceed their cost basis and, therefore, there is no lcm inventory market valuation reserve at the end of the year. based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings. such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover.
midstream ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors. our midstream segment profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‐party processing plants, purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‐related prices and the cost of third‐party transportation and fractionation services. to the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling volumes by our producer customers, such prices also affect midstream segment profitability.
the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations included in our midstream segment, primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. a majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our refining & marketing segment. the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. the volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. in most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from may through september of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. as with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.

net income attributable to mpc decreased $1.68 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $328 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to our refining & marketing segment income from operations, which decreased $2.54 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $548 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease in income from operations in 2016 for our refining & marketing segment was partially offset by increases in our midstream and speedway segments. income from operations for 2016 includes a non-cash benefit of $370 million related to the reversal of the company's lcm inventory valuation reserve and impairment charges of $356 million related to equity method investments and $130 million recorded by mplx to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill recorded in connection with the markwest merger. income from operations for 2015 includes a non-cash $370 million lcm inventory valuation charge and an impairment charge of $144 million. see segment results for additional information.
sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) decreased $8.71 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 and $25.77 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower refined product sales prices and sales volumes. the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to lower refined product sales prices, partially offset by increases in refined product sales volumes. mpc consolidated refined product sales decreased 32 mbpd in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 163 mbpd in 2015 compared to 2014.
income (loss) from equity method investments decreased $273 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and $65 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to impairment charges related to equity method investments of $356 million, partially offset by increases in income from new and existing pipeline and marine equity investments.the
60
decrease in 2015 was primarily due to decreases in income from our ethanol affiliates of $69 million, mainly due to lower ethanol prices.
net gain on disposal of assets increased $25 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased $14 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the sale of certain speedway locations during the year. the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the sale of two terminals and related terminal assets in 2014.
other income increased $66 million in 2016 compared to 2015. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of markwest other income and increased rin sales. other income in 2015 was comparable to 2014.
cost of revenues decreased $6.41 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 and $28.19 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to:
•   a decrease in refined product cost of sales of $6.52 billion, primarily due to a decrease in our average crude oil costs of $7.26 per barrel; partially offset by
•   an increase in refinery direct operating costs of $407 million, or $0.72 per barrel of total refinery throughput, primarily due to significantly higher turnaround activity in 2016 as compared to a lower than normal level of turnaround costs in 2015.
the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to:
•   a decrease in refined product cost of sales of $28.67 billion, primarily due to a decrease in our average crude oil costs of $43.97 per barrel, partially offset by an increase in refined product sales volumes; and
•   decreases in refinery direct operating costs of $726 million, or $1.40 per barrel of total refinery throughput, primarily due to significantly lower turnaround activity in 2015 and decreases in other manufacturing costs.
purchases from related parties increased $201 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased $197 million in 2015 compared 2014. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to:
•   increases in volumes transported by illinois extension pipeline, which is a pipeline affiliate that became operational in december of 2015, of $106 million;
•   increases in transportation services provided by crowley ocean partners, which is a new marine joint venture established in september of 2015, of $46 million; and
•   increases in transportation services provided by crowley blue water partners, which is a new marine joint venture established in may of 2016, of $37 million.
the decrease in purchases from related parties in 2015 was primarily due to decreases in prices and volumes of ethanol purchases from the andersons marathon ethanol llc, the andersons clymers ethanol llc and the andersons albion ethanol llc, our affiliated ethanol operations, of $149 million, decreases in purchases from loop of $36 million and explorer of $19 million.
inventory market valuation adjustment decreased costs and expenses by $740 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased costs and expenses by $370 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the lcm inventory reserve recorded in 2015 of $370 million was reversed in 2016 due to increases in refined product prices during the second quarter of 2016 resulting in reductions to cost of revenues of $370 million in 2016.
consumer excise taxes decreased $186 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $1.01 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in taxable refined product sales volumes and tax rates in certain jurisdictions. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to increases in taxable refined product sales volumes, including the effects of the acquisition of hess' retail operations and related assets.
impairment expense decreased $14 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $144 million in 2015 compared to 2014. impairment expense in 2016 reflects a $130 million charge recorded by mplx to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill recorded in connection with the markwest merger. in 2015, an impairment charge of $144 million was recorded related to the cancellation of the roux project at our garyville refinery. impairments related to equity method investments were recorded to income (loss) from equity method investments and discussed above.
61
depreciation and amortization increased $499 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and $176 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the depreciation of the fair value of the assets acquired in connection with the markwest merger. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to the depreciation of the fair value of the assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of hess' retail operations and related assets.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $29 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and $201 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of markwest expenses, largely offset by decreases in contract services and other selling, general and administrative expenses. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to increases in employee benefit costs, contract services and additional expenses related to the convenience stores acquired from hess along the east coast and southeast, partially offset by a decrease in pension settlement expenses.
other taxes increased $44 million in 2016 compared to 2015. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of markwest's taxes. other taxes in 2015 were comparable to 2014.
net interest and other financial costs increased $238 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and $102 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to interest on the debt assumed in the markwest merger. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to senior notes issued by mpc in september 2014 to finance the acquisition of hess' retail operations and related assets, higher levels of borrowings on mplx's bank revolving credit facility used to fund the acquisition of pipe line holdings and interest on the debt assumed from markwest. we capitalized interest of $63 million in 2016, $37 million in 2015 and $27 million in 2014. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 19 for further details.
provision for income taxes decreased $897 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $226 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to changes in our income before income taxes, which decreased $2.55 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $539 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the effective tax rates of 33 percent, 34 percent and 33 percent in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are slightly less than the u.s. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences, including the domestic manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state and local tax expense. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 12 for further details.

refining & marketing segment income from operations decreased $2.54 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $548 million in 2015 compared to 2014. segment income in 2015 includes a $345 million non-cash charge related to the company's lcm inventory reserve, which was reversed in 2016 due to increased refined product prices, resulting in a non-cash benefit to segment income of $345 million. the favorable lcm inventory adjustment variance was more than offset by the unfavorable effects of lower crack spreads and higher direct operating costs due to refinery turnarounds. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to higher crack spreads, favorable effects of changes in market structure on crude oil acquisition prices, more favorable net product price realizations compared to spot market reference prices and lower direct operating costs. these favorable impacts were partially offset by higher crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to benchmark lls crude oil, the unfavorable effect of lower commodity prices on volumetric gains and an lcm inventory valuation charge of $345 million.

based on the market indicators above and our refinery throughputs, we estimate the following impacts on refining & marketing segment income from operations for 2016 compared to 2015 and for 2015 compared to 2014:
•   the usgc lls 6-3-2-1 crack spread decreased $2.31 per barrel in 2016 compared to 2015 which had a negative impact on segment income of $1.13 billion and increased $1.88 per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014 which had a positive impact on segment income of $940 million.
•   the chicago lls 6-3-2-1 crack spread decreased $3.48 per barrel in 2016 compared to 2015 which had a negative impact on segment income of $846 million and increased $1.11 per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014 which had a positive impact on segment income of $400 million.
•   the sweet/sour crude oil differential increased $0.42 per barrel in 2016 compared to 2015 which had a positive impact on segment income of $334 million and narrowed $0.87 per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014 which had a negative impact on segment income of $27 million.
•   the lls-wti crude oil differential narrowed $2.04 per barrel in 2016 compared to 2015 resulting in a negative impact on segment income of $260 million. the lls-wti crude oil differential narrowed $0.40 per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014. this decrease was more than offset by an increase in volume of wti resulting in a positive impact on segment income of $6 million.
the market indicators shown above use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. differences in our results compared to these market indicators, including product price realizations, the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, the effects of lcm inventory valuation adjustments, the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, had an estimated negative impact on refining & marketing segment income of $304 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and $1.03 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. the significant elements of the negative impact for 2016 were unfavorable product price realizations and unfavorable crude acquisition costs relative to the market indicators, partially offset by the reversal of the company's lcm inventory valuation reserve that was recorded in 2015. the significant elements of the negative impact for 2015 were unfavorable crude oil acquisition costs relative to the market indicators, the unfavorable effect of lower commodity prices on volumetric gains, the price differential of charge and blend stock relative to crude oil and the lcm inventory valuation charge, partially offset by the effects of changes in market structure on our crude oil acquisition costs and product price realizations.
the cost of inventories of crude oil and refinery feedstocks, refined products and merchandise is determined primarily under the lifo method. in the second quarter of 2016, we had recognized the the effects of an interim liquidation of our refined products inventories which we did not expect to reinstate by year end resulting in a pre-tax charge of approximately $54 million to income. based on year end refined product inventories, which were higher than inventories at the beginning of the year, we had a build in refined product inventories for 2016. therefore, we recognized the effects of this annual build in our refined products in the fourth quarter of 2016 which had the effect of reversing the second quarter charge. in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a lifo charge of $45 million as a result of annual decreased levels in refined products and crude inventory volumes. since the lifo costs for these inventory layers were based on 2014 costs, the liquidation resulted in a charge to income. in the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized annual builds in our refined product and crude inventories. these builds were based on january 2014 costs which were significantly higher than fourth quarter 2014 costs resulting in a benefit of approximately $240 million to income. for the full year, we recognized a lifo charge of $2 million in 2016 and $78 million in 2015 as compared to a lifo benefit of $265 million in 2014.

refinery direct operating costs increased $0.72 per barrel in 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased $1.40 per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014. these changes in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2015 compared to 2014 include an increase in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs of $0.70 per barrel and a decrease of $0.67 per barrel, respectively, as well as decreases in other manufacturing costs of $0.06 per barrel and $0.71, respectively. the increase in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs for 2016 are primarily attributable to higher turnaround activity at the galveston bay, garyville and robinson refineries and a lower than normal schedule of turnaround activity in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in turnaround activity at the catlettsburg refinery. the decrease in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs for 2015 was primarily attributable to lower turnaround activity at the galveston bay, robinson and garyville refineries, partially offset by an increase in turnaround activity at the detroit refinery. in 2016, the decrease in other manufacturing costs was primarily due to lower routine maintenance costs, general and administrative expenses and waste costs. in 2015, the decrease in other manufacturing costs was primarily attributable to lower energy costs and routine maintenance costs.
we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance. our expenses associated with purchased rins were $288 million in 2016, $212 million in 2015 and $141 million in 2014. in 2015, we recorded a $46 million charge to recognize increased estimated costs for compliance based on the renewable fuel standards for 2014 and 2015 proposed by the epa in may 2015 and finalized in november 2015, particularly those for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels. excluding this charge, the increases in both years were primarily due to the effect of increased purchases of biomass-based diesel rins at increased prices. in 2015, this increase was partially offset by decreased purchases of ethanol rins at decreased prices.
speedway segment income from operations increased $61 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and $129 million in 2015 compared to 2014. segment income in 2015 includes a $25 million non-cash charge related to the company's lcm inventory reserve, which was reversed in 2016 due to increased refined product prices, resulting in a non-cash benefit to segment income of $25 million. in addition to the favorable lcm inventory adjustment variance, the remaining increase during the year was primarily due to higher merchandise gross margin of $67 million and gains from asset sales, partially offset by lower gasoline and distillate gross margin of $91 million, or $0.0167 per gallon. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to an increases in our gasoline and distillate gross margin of $401 million and our merchandise gross margin of $393 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses. the increase in 2015 was primarily attributable the full year effect of the acquisition of hess' retail operations and related assets on september 30, 2014. the increases in merchandise gross margin in both years were related to a combination of higher merchandise and food sales and improved margins.

midstream segment income from operations increased $491 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and $38 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of markwest's operating results following the merger with mplx, as well as earnings from new and existing pipeline and marine equity investments. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to the inclusion of the financial results of markwest, which are reflected in midstream segment income from the december 4, 2015 markwest merger date, partially offset by $30 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition.
corporate and other unallocated expenses decreased $22 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $22 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease in 2016 is primarily due to increased allocations of corporate costs to the segments. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to a lower allocation of employee benefit costs to the segments.
unallocated items in 2016 also includes impairment charges of $486 million resulting from non-cash charges of $267 million related to the indefinite deferral of the sandpiper pipeline project, $130 million related to the goodwill recognized in connection with the markwest merger and $89 million related to an mplx equity method investment. unallocated items in 2015 includes an impairment charge of $144 million recorded in the third quarter of 2015 related to the cancellation of the roux project at our garyville refinery. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17 for additional information on the impairment charges.

net cash provided by operating activities decreased $75 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to decreased operating results, partially offset by favorable changes in working capital of $1.22 billion compared to 2015. net cash provided by operating activities increased $951 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased operating results, partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital of $330 million compared to 2014. the above changes in working capital exclude changes in short-term debt.
for 2016, changes in working capital were a net $200 million source of cash, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in current receivables and inventories. changes from december 31, 2015 to december 31, 2016 per the consolidated balance sheets, excluding the impact of acquisitions, were as follows:
•   accounts payable increased $850 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to higher crude oil payable prices.
•   current receivables increased $690 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil receivable prices.

•   excluding the change in the company's lcm inventory valuation reserve of $370 million, inventories increased $61 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product inventory volumes.
for 2015, changes in working capital were a net $1.02 billion use of cash, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by decreases in current receivables and inventories. accounts payable decreased $1.92 billion from year-end 2014, primarily due to lower crude oil payable prices and volumes; current receivables decreased $1.13 billion from year-end 2014, primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil receivable prices and lower crude oil receivable volumes; and inventories decreased $47 million from year-end 2014, excluding a $370 million lcm inventory valuation charge, primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil inventory volumes.
for 2014, changes in working capital were a net $694 million use of cash, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in inventories, partially offset by a decrease in current receivables. excluding the impact of acquisitions, accounts payable decreased $1.65 billion from year-end 2013, primarily due to lower crude oil payable prices, partially offset by higher crude oil payable volumes; inventories decreased $796 million from year-end 2013, primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil inventory volumes; and current receivables decreased $1.63 billion from year-end 2013, primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil receivable prices.
cash flows used in investing activities decreased $500 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and $1.10 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. the investing activity is further discussed below.

net investments were a use of cash of $262 million in 2016 compared to $327 million in 2015 and $404 million in 2014. the change in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to decreases in contributions to the sax pipeline project of $114 million, the sandpiper pipeline project of $57 million and crowley ocean partners of $38 million, partially offset by increases in contributions to crowley coastal partners of $82 million and mplx equity method investments of $74 million. the change in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in contributions to the sax pipeline project of $121 million and the 2014 investment in explorer, partially offset by contributions to crowley ocean partners of $72 million.
financing activities were a $1.29 billion use of cash in 2016, a $987 million use of cash in 2015 and a $635 million source of cash in 2014.
long-term debt borrowings and repayments were a net $1.42 billion use of cash in 2016 compared to a $746 million source of cash in 2015 and a $3.22 billion source of cash in 2014. during 2016, mplx used proceeds from its issuance of the mplx preferred units to repay amounts outstanding under the mplx bank revolving credit facility and mpc chose to prepay $500 million under its term loan. during 2015, we used $763 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of $1.5 billion of mpc senior notes to extinguish our obligation for the $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2016 and mplx used proceeds from its issuance of $500 million aggregate of principal amount of mplx senior notes to repay $385 million outstanding under the mplx bank revolving credit facility. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 19 for additional information on our long-term debt.
cash proceeds from the issuance of mplx common units were $776 million in 2016 and $221 million in 2014. cash proceeds from the issuance of mplx preferred units was $984 million in 2016. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 4 for further discussion of mplx.

because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, including a commercial paper program, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.
as discussed in the "strategic actions to enhance shareholder value" section in the corporate overview, we expect mplx to finance the planned dropdown transactions with debt and equity in approximately equal proportions in the aggregate for all planned dropdowns of assets. the equity financing will be funded through mplx common units issued to us. in conjunction with the completion of the dropdowns, we also expect to exchange our economic interests in the general partner of mplx, including incentive distribution rights, for newly issued mplx common units. cash proceeds from the dropdowns and ongoing mplx common unit distributions to us are expected to fund the substantial ongoing return of capital to mpc shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining an investment-grade credit profile.
see discussion of the february 2017 issuance of mplx senior notes due 2027 and 2047 under the mplx lp section of the executive summary.
commercial paper - on february 26, 2016, we established a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of $2 billion in commercial paper outstanding, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. we do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facilities. at december 31, 2016, we had no amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program.
mpc bank revolving credit facility - on july 20, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders to replace our existing mpc bank revolving credit facility due in 2017. the new agreement provides for a four-year $2.5 billion bank revolving credit facility ("four-year revolving credit facility") maturing on july 20, 2020. additionally, we entered into a 364-day $1 billion bank revolving credit facility maturing on july 19, 2017. the financial covenants contained in these agreements remain the same as under the previous bank revolving credit facility.
our four-year revolving credit facility includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to $2.0 billion and swingline loan capacity of up to $100 million. we may increase our borrowing capacity under our four-year revolving credit facility by up to an additional $500 million, subject to certain conditions including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would be increased. in addition, the maturity date of the four-year revolving credit facility may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods subject to the approval of lenders holding a majority of the commitments then outstanding, provided that the commitments of any non-consenting lenders will terminate on the then-effective maturity date.
there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding at december 31, 2016.
trade receivables facility - on july 20, 2016, we amended our trade receivables facility to, among other things, reduce the capacity from $1 billion to $750 million and to extend the maturity date to july 19, 2019. the reduction in capacity reflects the lower refined product price environment.
70
as of december 31, 2016, eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of $684 million. there were no borrowings outstanding at december 31, 2016. availability under our trade receivables facility is a function of refined product selling prices.
mplx credit agreement - mplx is party to a credit agreement, dated as of november 20, 2014, and amended as of october 27, 2015 ("mplx credit agreement"), providing for a $2 billion bank revolving credit facility with a maturity date of december 4, 2020 and an outstanding $250 million term loan facility with a maturity date of november 20, 2019.
the mplx credit agreement includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to $250 million and swingline loan capacity of up to $100 million. the revolving borrowing capacity under the mplx credit agreement may be increased by up to an additional $500 million, subject to certain conditions, including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would increase. in addition, the maturity date of the bank revolving credit facility may be extended from time-to-time during its term to a date that is one year after the then-effective date, subject to the approval of lenders holding the majority of the loans and commitments then outstanding, provided that the commitments of any non-consenting lenders will be terminated on the then-effective maturity date.
the maturity date for the term loan facility may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods subject to the consent of the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding term loan borrowings, provided that the portion of the term loan borrowings held by any non-consenting lenders will continue to be due and payable on the then-effective maturity date.
during 2016, mplx borrowed $434 million under the bank revolving credit facility, at an average interest rate of 1.9 percent, per annum, and repaid $1.31 billion of outstanding borrowings. at december 31, 2016, mplx had no borrowings and $3 million of letters of credit outstanding under the bank revolving credit facility, resulting in total unused loan availability of $2.0 billion.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 19 for further discussion of our debt.
the term loan agreement, the mpc bank revolving credit facility and the mplx credit agreement contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. the financial covenant included in the term loan agreement and the mpc bank revolving credit facility requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization (as defined in the term loan agreement and the mpc bank revolving credit facility) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. as of december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization of 0.31 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the term loan agreement and the mpc bank revolving credit facility.
the mplx credit agreement includes certain representations and warranties, affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type. the mplx credit agreement includes a financial covenant that requires mplx to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to consolidated ebitda (both as defined in the mplx credit agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions). consolidated ebitda is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. other covenants restrict mplx and certain of its subsidiaries from incurring debt, creating liens on its assets and entering into transactions with affiliates. as of december 31, 2016, mplx was in compliance with the covenants contained in the mplx credit agreement, including a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda of 3.26 to 1.0.
our intention is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. as of january 31, 2017, the credit ratings on our and mplx's senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows.
company   rating agency           rating mpc       moody's                 baa2 (negative outlook)
standard &amp; poor's   bbb (stable outlook)
fitch                   bbb (negative watch)
mplx      moody's                 baa3 (stable outlook)
standard &amp; poor's   bbb- (stable outlook)
fitch                   bbb- (stable outlook)
the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment-grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.
71
neither the revolving credit facility, the mplx credit agreement nor our trade receivables facility contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. however, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment-grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the revolving credit facility and our trade receivables facility. in addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment-grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements.
debt-to-total-capital ratio our debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 33 percent and 38 percent at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

redeemable noncontrolling interest - on may 13, 2016, mplx completed the private placement of approximately 30.8 million 6.5 percent series a convertible preferred units (the "mplx preferred units") at a cash price of $32.50 per unit. the mplx preferred units are considered redeemable securities due to the existence of redemption provisions upon a deemed liquidation event which is considered outside mplx's control. therefore they are presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets. we have recorded the mplx preferred units at their issuance date fair value, net of issuance costs.
mpc senior notes - on december 14, 2015, we completed a public offering of $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes ("mpc senior notes"). the net proceeds from the offering of the mpc senior notes were $1.49 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. we used approximately $763 million of the net proceeds from this offering to fund the extinguishment of our obligation for the $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.500% senior notes due 2016.
the mpc senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of ours and rank equally with all our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
mplx and markwest senior notes - in connection with the markwest merger, mplx assumed markwest's outstanding debt, which included $4.1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. on december 22, 2015, approximately $4.04 billion aggregate principal amount of markwest's outstanding senior notes were exchanged for an aggregate principal amount of approximately $4.04 billion of new unsecured senior notes issued by mplx in an exchange offer and consent solicitation undertaken by mplx and markwest.
on february 12, 2015, mplx completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of four percent unsecured senior notes due february 15, 2025. the net proceeds, which were approximately $495 million after deducting underwriting discounts, were used to repay the amounts outstanding under the mplx bank revolving credit facility, as well as for general partnership purposes.
see discussion of the february 2017 issuance of mplx senior notes due 2027 and 2047 under the mplx lp section of the executive summary.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 19 for further discussion of our debt.

capital requirements our board approved a 2017 capital spending and investment plan of $1.7 billion for mpc, excluding mplx. mplx's capital investment plan includes $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion of organic growth capital, not including anticipated dropdowns and acquisitions previously discussed or their respective subsequent capital spending, and approximately $100 million of maintenance capital. additional details related to expected 2017 capital spending and investments are discussed in the capital budget outlook section below.
during the second quarter of 2016, we paid bp $200 million for the third period's contingent earnout related to the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and have paid bp $569 million to-date leaving $131 million remaining under the total cap of $700 million. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17.
in 2016, we made pension contributions totaling $119 million. we have no required funding for 2017, but may make voluntary contributions at our discretion.
on january 27, 2017, our board of directors approved a $0.36 per share dividend, payable march 10, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on february 16, 2017.
since january 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $10.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $7.44 billion of our common stock, leaving $2.56 billion available for repurchases as of december 31, 2016. under these authorizations, we have acquired 202 million shares at an average cost per share of $36.77.
we may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through rule 10b5-1 plans. the timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including execution of our strategic initiatives, market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.
we may, from time to time, repurchase notes in the open market, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in such volumes, at such prices and upon such other terms as we deem appropriate.
contractual cash obligations the table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of december 31, 2016. the contractual obligations detailed below do not include our contractual obligations to mplx under various fee-based commercial agreements as these transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.
we have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. in conjunction with the spinoff, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to marathon oil. these arrangements are described in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 25.
capital budget outlook we expect to spend $1.7 billion in 2017 on capital projects and investments, excluding mplx, capitalized interest and acquisitions we may complete. we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.
refining & marketing the refining & marketing segment's forecasted 2017 capital spending and investments is $1.17 billion, which includes approximately $325 million for refining margin enhancement projects and approximately $840 million for refinery-sustaining capital. a number of these projects span multiple years.
the $325 million forecasted for refining margin enhancement projects includes spending for garyville distillate projects, galveston bay export capacity expansion and approximately $85 million for the star project.
the remaining $840 million budget is primarily allocated to maintaining facilities and meeting regulatory requirements, including the epa's tier 3 gasoline fuel standards, at our refineries.
speedway the speedway segment's 2017 capital forecast of approximately $380 million is focused on building new stores and remodeling and rebuilding existing retail locations in its core markets. we have identified numerous opportunities for new convenience stores or store rebuilds in our existing market, with a continued focus in pennsylvania and tennessee, as well as opportunities for growth in new markets including georgia, south carolina and the florida panhandle. we also plan to capitalize on diesel demand growth by building out our network of commercial fueling lane locations, within our core market which cater to local and regional transport fleets.
midstream mplx's capital investment plan includes $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion of organic growth capital, not including anticipated dropdowns and acquisitions previously discussed or their respective subsequent capital spending, and approximately $100 million of maintenance capital. approximately $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion of these growth investments are for the development of natural gas and gas liquids infrastructure to support mplx's producer customers, primarily in the prolific marcellus shale. the remaining $400 million of growth capital is planned for the development of various crude oil and refined petroleum products infrastructure projects, including a build-out of utica shale infrastructure in connection with the recently completed cornerstone pipeline, a butane cavern in robinson, illinois, and a tank farm expansion in texas city, texas.
the midstream segment's forecasted 2017 capital spend, excluding mplx, is approximately $90 million.
corporate and other the 2017 capital forecast includes approximately $100 million to support corporate activities.

factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include our ability to achieve the strategic and other objectives related to the strategic initiatives discussed herein; adverse changes in laws including with respect to tax and regulatory matters; inability to agree with the mplx conflicts committee with respect to the timing of and value attributed to assets identified for dropdown; changes to the expected construction costs and timing of projects; continued/further volatility in and/or degradation of market and industry conditions; the availability and pricing of crude oil and other feedstocks; slower growth in domestic and canadian crude supply; completion of pipeline capacity to areas outside the u.s. midwest; consumer demand for refined products; transportation logistics; the reliability of processing units and other equipment; mpc's ability to successfully implement growth opportunities; modifications to mplx earnings and distribution growth objectives; compliance with federal and state environmental, economic, health and safety, energy and other policies and regulations, including the cost of compliance with the renewable fuel standard, and/or enforcement actions initiated thereunder; changes to mpc's capital budget; other risk factors inherent to mpc's industry; these factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. for additional information on forward-looking statements and risks that can affect our business, see "disclosures regarding forward-looking statements" and item 1a. risk factors in this annual report on form 10-k.
transactions with related parties we believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 7 for discussion of activity with related parties.
environmental matters and compliance costs we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. if these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.
legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including costs of compliance and permitting delays. the extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered, the costs and the time frames for compliance, and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers. for additional information see item 1a. risk factors.
our environmental expenditures, including non-regulatory expenditures, for each of the last three years were:

(a)   based on the american petroleum institute's definition of environmental expenditures.
(b)   these amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude non-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation.
we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required.
new or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. we believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed.
75
our environmental capital expenditures accounted for ten percent, nine percent and five percent of capital expenditures excluding the markwest merger and the acquisition of hess' retail operations and related assets in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate $422 million, or 12 percent, of total capital expenditures in 2017. predictions beyond 2017 can only be broad-based estimates, which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies, among other matters. based on currently identified projects, we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $400 million in 2018; however, actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed.
for more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see item 1. business - environmental matters, item 1a. risk factors and item 3. legal proceedings.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.
fair value estimates fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. there are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. the income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts. the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. this is often referred to as current replacement cost. the cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence.
the fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques. these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
•   level 1 - observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
•   level 2 - observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. these are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date.
•   level 3 - unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.
valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. the assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. we use a market or income approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17 for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements.
76
significant uses of fair value measurements include:
•   assessment of impairment of long-lived assets;
•   assessment of impairment of intangible assets:
•   assessment of impairment of goodwill;
•   assessment of impairment of equity method investments;
•   recorded values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions; and
•   recorded values of derivative instruments.
impairment assessments of long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity method investments fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. significant assumptions include:
•   future margins on products produced and sold. our estimates of future product margins are based on our analysis of various supply and demand factors, which include, among other things, industry-wide capacity, our planned utilization rate, end-user demand, capital expenditures and economic conditions. such estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews.
•   future volumes. our estimates of future refinery, pipeline throughput and natural gas and ngl processing volumes are based on internal forecasts prepared by our refining &amp; marketing and midstream segments operations personnel.
•   discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. we apply a discount rate to our cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. this discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible. a higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows.
•   future capital requirements. these are based on authorized spending and internal forecasts.
we base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable. however, actual results may differ from these projections.
the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced, a poor outlook for profitability, a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes, a significant reduction in natural gas or ngls processed, a significant reduction in refining margins, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the asset or equity method investment is located.
long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flow of an asset group. for purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for refining & marketing segment assets, site level for speedway segment convenience stores, and the plant level or pipeline system level for midstream segment assets. if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, fair value is calculated, and the carrying value is written down if greater than the calculated fair value.
unlike long-lived assets, goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. we have thirteen reporting units, nine of which have goodwill allocated to them. at december 31, 2016, we had a total of $3.59 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
based on an interim goodwill impairment test, mplx recorded approximately $130 million of impairment expense related to charges recorded during the first and second quarters of 2016, which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements.
mpc has nine reporting units with goodwill totaling approximately $3.59 billion as of november 30, 2016. step 1 of the annual impairment analysis resulted in the fair value of the reporting units exceeding their carrying value by percentages ranging from approximately 8 percent to 303 percent. the reporting unit with fair value exceeding its carrying value by approximately 8 percent has goodwill of $228 million at december 31, 2016. an increase of 0.50 percent to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge as of november 30, 2016. significant assumptions used to estimate the reporting units' fair value included estimates of future cash flows. if estimates for future cash flows, which are impacted primarily by commodity prices and producers' production plans, were to decline, the overall reporting units' fair value would decrease, resulting in potential goodwill impairment charges. fair value determinations
77
require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. as a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.
equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value. factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value, absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee's inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value. at december 31, 2016, we had $3.83 billion of investments in equity method investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g., pricing, volumes and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. that is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions.
mplx performed a fixed asset impairment analysis during the second quarter of 2016 for ohio condensate company ("occ") resulting in an impairment charge of $96 million within occ's financial statements. approximately $58 million of the charge was attributable to mplx based on its 60 percent ownership of occ and was recorded in income (loss) from equity method investments on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. furthermore, to determine the potential equity method impairment charge, an impairment analysis in accordance with asc topic 323 was performed during the second quarter resulting in an additional impairment charge of approximately $31 million, recorded in income (loss) from equity method investments on the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
for purposes of the second quarter impairment analysis, the fair value of occ was determined based on applying the discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach, and the guideline public company method, which is a market approach. the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value under the discounted cash flow method included management's best estimates of the expected results using a probability weighted average set of cash flow forecasts and using a discount rate of 11.2 percent. fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. as such, the fair value of the occ equity method investment and its underlying fixed assets represents a level 3 measurement.
as of december 31, 2016, mplx determined that there were no material events or changes in circumstances that would indicate an other-than-temporary decline in its equity method investments.
during the third quarter of 2016, enbridge energy partners announced that its affiliate, north dakota pipeline, would withdraw certain pending regulatory applications for its sandpiper pipeline project and that the project would be deferred indefinitely. these decisions were considered to indicate an impairment of the costs capitalized to date on the project. as the operator of north dakota pipeline and the entity responsible for maintaining its financial records, enbridge completed a fixed asset impairment analysis as of august 31, 2016, in accordance with asc topic 360. based on the estimated liquidation value of the fixed assets, an impairment charge was recorded by north dakota pipeline. based on our 37.5 percent ownership of north dakota pipeline, we recognized approximately $267 million of this charge in the third quarter of 2016 through "income (loss) from equity method investments" on the accompanying consolidated statements of income which impaired virtually all of our $301 million investment in the project. also, in accordance with asc topic 323, we completed an assessment to determine the potential additional equity method impairment charge to be recorded on our consolidated financial statements resulting from an other-than-temporary impairment. the result of this analysis indicated no additional charge was required to be recorded.
the fixed assets of north dakota pipeline related to the sandpiper pipeline project consist primarily of project management and engineering costs, pipe, valves, motors and other equipment, land and easements. the fair value of fixed assets was estimated based on a market approach using the estimated price that would be received to sell pipe, land and other related equipment in its current condition, considering the current market conditions for sale of these assets and length of disposal period. the valuation considered a range of potential selling prices from various alternatives that could be used to dispose of these assets. as such, the fair value of the north dakota pipeline equity method investment and its underlying assets represents a level 3 measurement. north dakota pipeline expects to dispose of these assets through orderly transactions.
centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through 2015. at december 31, 2016, centennial was not shipping product. as a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in centennial. we concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of centennial's assets. if market conditions were to change and the owners of centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets, there could be a future impairment of our centennial interest. as of december 31, 2016, our equity investment in centennial was $35 million and we had a $29 million guarantee associated with 50 percent of centennial's outstanding debt. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 25 for additional information on the debt guarantee.
78
the above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the carrying value of our centennial equity investment. factors that could affect the carrying value of our centennial equity investment include, but are not limited to, a change in business conditions, a further decline or improvement in the long-term outlook of the potential uses of centennial's assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets. these factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
acquisitions in accounting for business combinations, acquired assets, assumed liabilities and contingent consideration are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. the excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain, respectively. a significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, contingent consideration and other assets and liabilities. we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party consultants for assistance.
the fair value of assets and liabilities, including contingent consideration, as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches, including the income approach, which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate; the cost approach, which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates; and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entity-specific differences. the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value.
for the customer contract intangibles for our midstream segment, we must estimate the expected life of the relationships with our customers on an individual basis. the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value.
the fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay to bp is re-measured each quarter using an income approach, with changes in fair value recorded in cost of revenues. the amount of cash to be paid under the arrangement is based on both a market-based crack spread and refinery throughput volumes for the months during which the contract applies, as well as established thresholds that cap the annual and total payment. we used internal and external forecasts for the crack spread and internal forecasts for refinery throughput volumes and applied an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate to the range of cash flows indicated by various scenarios to determine the fair value of the arrangement. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 5 for additional information on our acquisitions. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17 for additional information on fair value measurements.
derivatives we record all derivative instruments at fair value. substantially all of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value. fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17. additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
variable interest entities we evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership or other pecuniary interest to determine if the entity is a vie. our interests in a vie are referred to as variable interests. variable interests can be contractual, ownership or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the vie's assets. when we conclude that we hold an interest in a vie we must determine if we are the entity's primary beneficiary. a primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie. this controlling financial interest is evidenced by both (a) the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie. we consolidate any vie when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary. we must disclose the nature of any interests in a vie that is not consolidated.
significant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a vie and in evaluating our interest in a vie. we use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a vie. we evaluate the entity's need for continuing financial support; the equity holder's lack of a controlling financial interest; and/or if an equity holder's voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns. we evaluate our interests in a vie to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. we use a primarily qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the vie, either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group. we continually monitor our interests in legal
79
entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests, including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions.
mplx is a vie because the limited partners of mplx do not have substantive kick-out or substantive participating rights over the general partner. we are the primary beneficiary of mplx because in addition to significant economic interest, we also have the power, through our 100 percent ownership of the general partner, to control the decisions that most significantly impact mplx. we therefore consolidate mplx and record a noncontrolling interest for the 74.5 percent interest owned by the public.
markwest utica emg, a natural gas and ngl processing joint venture, is a vie; however, we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary. as a result, it is accounted for under the equity method. changes in the design or nature of the activities of this entity, or our involvement with the entity, may require us to reconsider our conclusions on the entity's status as a vie and/or our status as the primary beneficiary. such reconsideration requires significant judgment and understanding of the organization. this could result in the consolidation of the entity which would have a significant impact on our financial statements. ohio gathering is a subsidiary of markwest utica emg and is a vie. if we were to consolidate markwest utica emg, ohio gathering would need to be assessed for consolidation or deconsolidation.
variable interest entities are discussed in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 6 .
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations - to be updated accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following:
•   the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations;
•   the expected long-term return on plan assets;
•   the rate of future increases in compensation levels;
•   health care cost projections; and
•   the mortality table used in determining future plan obligations.
we utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. we have selected different discount rates for our funded pension plans and our unfunded retiree health care plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. the selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness. in determining the assumed discount rates, we use our third-party actuary's discount rate model. this model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from aa bond yields. the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. the bonds used have an average rating of aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and generally only non-callable bonds are included. outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included. each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding.
of the assumptions used to measure the year-end obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. decreasing the discount rates of 3.90 percent for our pension plans and 4.25 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 0.25 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $44 million and $26 million, respectively, and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $3 million and $1 million, respectively.
the long-term asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 51 percent equity securities and 49 percent fixed income securities for the primary funded pension plan), past performance and other factors. certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns. in addition, our long-term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness. we used the 6.50 percent long-term rate of return to determine our 2016 defined benefit pension expense. after evaluating activity in the capital markets, along with the current and projected plan investments, we did not change the asset rate of return for our primary plan from 6.50 percent effective for 2017. decreasing the 6.50 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 percent would increase our defined benefit pension expense by $4 million.
compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans.
health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends.
we utilized the 2016 mortality tables from the u.s. society of actuaries.

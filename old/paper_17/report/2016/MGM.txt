item 1a.   risk factors

you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the sec could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. in evaluating us, you should consider carefully, among other things, the risks described below.
risks relating to our substantial indebtedness
•   our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including the fixed component of our rent payments to mgp, could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations. our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including the fixed component of our rent payments to mgp, could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations. as of december 31, 2016, we had approximately $13.1 billion principal amount of indebtedness outstanding, including $250 million of borrowings outstanding and $1.2 billion of available borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facility, and $1.9 billion, $2.1 billion and $450 million of debt outstanding under the mgm china, operating partnership, and mgm national harbor credit facilities, respectively. in addition, the operating partnership has $1.55 billion of senior notes outstanding. any increase in the interest rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our other liquidity needs. we do not guarantee mgm china's, mgm national harbor's or the operating partnership's obligations under their respective debt agreements and, to the extent mgm macau, mgm national harbor or the operating partnership were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service their indebtedness, our ability to make additional investments into such entities is limited by the covenants in our existing senior secured credit facility.

in addition, our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us, including:
•   increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•   limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;

•   limiting our ability to borrow additional funds;

•   making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; or

•   placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors.

moreover, our businesses are capital intensive. for our owned, leased and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive, we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished (and, under the master lease we are required to spend an aggregate amount of at least 1% of actual adjusted net revenues from the properties included under the master lease on capital expenditures at those properties). such investment requires an ongoing supply of cash and, to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations, funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained. similarly, development projects, including our development project in massachusetts, and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, guarantees of third-party debt, or the incurrence of contingent liabilities, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•   current and future economic, capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service or refinance our indebtedness and to make planned expenditures. our ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our indebtedness and to fund planned or committed capital expenditures and investments depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future, receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries, including mgm china and the operating partnership, borrow under our senior secured credit facility or incur new indebtedness. if regional and national economic conditions deteriorate we could experience decreased revenues from our operations attributable to decreases in consumer spending levels and could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments. we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, continue to receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries, including mgm china and the operating partnership, that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs or that we will be able to access the capital markets in the future to borrow additional indebtedness on terms that are favorable to us.

we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2018, and thereafter. our ability to timely refinance and replace our indebtedness in the future will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above. if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis, we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing, dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments. there is no assurance that any of these alternatives
12
would be available to us, if at all, on satisfactory terms, on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us, or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements.
•   the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations. covenants governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our debt securities restrict, among other things, our ability to:

•   pay dividends or distributions, repurchase or issue equity, prepay certain debt or make certain investments;

•   incur additional debt;

•   incur liens on assets;

•   sell assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets;

•   enter into transactions with affiliates;

•   allow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets; and

•   enter into sale and lease-back transactions.

our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. the breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. in addition, our senior secured credit facility requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants, including a maximum total net leverage ratio, a maximum first lien net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. any default under our senior secured credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth, our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt.
in addition, mgm grand paradise and mgm china are co-borrowers under an amended and restated credit facility and the operating partnership and mgm national harbor, llc are each borrowers under their respective senior secured credit facilities, all of which contain covenants that restrict the respective borrower's ability to engage in certain transactions. in particular, these credit agreements require mgm china, the operating partnership and mgm national harbor, llc to satisfy certain financial covenants and impose certain operating and financial restrictions on mgm china, the operating partnership and mgm national harbor, llc, and each of their subsidiaries (including, with respect to mgm china, mgm grand paradise), respectively. these restrictions include, among other things, limitations on their ability to pay dividends or distributions to us, incur additional debt, make investments or engage in other businesses, merge or consolidate with other companies, or transfer or sell assets.
•   we are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flows as fixed and percentage rent under the master lease, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth, service our indebtedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes. we are required to pay annual rent of $650 million, which increased from $550 million as a result of the borgata transaction on august 1, 2016 (with annual escalators of 2% in the second through sixth years of the master lease and the possibility for additional 2% increases thereafter, as well as potential increases in percentage rent every five years), to mgp pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the master lease. as a result, our ability to fund our own operations, raise capital, make acquisitions, make investments, service our debt and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected. for example, our obligations under the master lease may:

•   make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness;

•   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;

•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making rent payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects and other general corporate purposes;

•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

•   restrict our ability to make acquisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions; and

•   cause us to lose our rights with respect to all of the properties leased under the master lease if we fail to pay rent or other amounts or otherwise default on the master lease, given that all of the properties we lease from mgp under the master lease are effectively cross-collateralized as a result of the master lease being a single unitary lease.

13
any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
risks related to our business
•   we face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. the hotel, resort and casino industries are highly competitive. we do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area, and hotel, resort and gaming operations in other states or countries could attract our customers. to the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacity is expanded by others in major destination locations, competition will increase. major competitors, including potential new entrants, may also expand their hotel room capacity, expand their range of amenities, improve their level of service, or construct new resorts in las vegas, macau or in the domestic regional markets in which we operate, all of which could attract our customers. also, the growth of gaming in areas outside las vegas, including california, has increased the competition faced by our operations in las vegas and elsewhere.

in addition, competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the united states and elsewhere result in the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos, such as has happened in california. for example, while our macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near asia (including singapore, korea, australia, new zealand, malaysia, vietnam, cambodia, the philippines, russia, cruise ships in asia that offer gaming, and unlicensed gaming operations), certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming (including japan) and others (such as taiwan and thailand) may legalize casino gaming (or online gaming) in the future. furthermore, currently mgm grand paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the macau government to operate casinos in macau. if the macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaires open additional facilities (for example, the facilities currently being developed in cotai, macau are expected to increase total hotel room inventory by 10% through 2018 and significantly increase other gaming and non-gaming offerings in macau), we would face increased competition.
most jurisdictions where casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical and/or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses. although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming, in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities (which may include acquisitions of existing properties) that do arise. furthermore, certain jurisdictions, including nevada and new jersey, have also legalized forms of online gaming and other jurisdictions, including illinois, have legalized video gaming terminals. the expansion of online gaming and other types of gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casino resorts.
in addition to competition with other hotels, resorts and casinos, we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate. our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
•   our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations. our ownership and operation of gaming facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries, states and provinces in which we operate. these laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations. as such, our gaming regulators can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or, alternatively, cease operations in that jurisdiction. in addition, unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions. the regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. in addition, we are subject to various gaming taxes, which are subject to possible increase at any time by various federal, state, local and foreign legislatures and officials. increases in gaming taxation could also adversely affect our results. for a summary of gaming and other regulations that affect our business, see "regulation and licensing" and exhibit 99.2 to this annual report on form 10-k.

further, our directors, officers, key employees and investors in our properties must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities. if state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his, her or its interest in
14
the property. state regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors, officers, key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards. certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities.
in macau, current laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are, for the most part, fairly recent and there is little precedent on the interpretation of these laws and regulations. these laws and regulations are complex, and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations, or issue new or modified regulations, that differ from mgm china's interpretation, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, mgm china's activities in macau are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies. we cannot assure you that mgm china will be able to obtain all necessary approvals, and any such failure to do so may materially affect its long-term business strategy and operations. macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions; however, to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues.
in addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. these laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. for instance, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the clean air act, the clean water act, the resource conservation recovery act, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act and the oil pollution act of 1990. under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. for example, illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places, including bars, restaurants, work places, schools and casinos. similarly, in october 2014, casinos in macau, including mgm china, implemented a smoking ban which prohibits smoking on all mass market gaming floors and, in 2015, the macau health bureau announced that they will promote the submission of a bill proposing a full smoking ban in casinos, including in vip rooms. the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted, though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance.
we also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various anti-money laundering laws and regulations. for instance, we are subject to regulation under the currency and foreign transactions reporting act of 1970, commonly known as the "bank secrecy act"", which, among other things, requires us to report to the internal revenue service ("irs") any currency transactions in excess of $10,000 that occur within a 24-hour gaming day, including identification of the individual(s) involved in the currency transaction. we are also required to report certain suspicious activity where we know, suspect or have reason to suspect transactions, among other things, involve funds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawful purpose. in addition, under the bank secrecy act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting, recordkeeping and retention. our compliance with the bank secrecy act is subject to periodic examinations by the irs. any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. any violations of the anti-money laundering laws, including the bank secrecy act, or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
•   our business is affected by economic and market conditions in the markets in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside. our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending and corporate spending on conventions, trade shows and business development. economic contraction, economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions may cause a decline in demand for hotels, casino resorts, trade shows and conventions, and for the type of luxury amenities we offer. in addition, changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as the increased cost of travel, an unstable job market, perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth, outbreaks of contagious diseases or fears of war and future acts of terrorism. consumer preferences also evolve over time due to a variety of factors, including demographic changes, which, for instance, have resulted in recent growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings. our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers and timely react to these trends, and any failure to do so may negatively impact our results of operations. aria, bellagio and mgm grand las vegas in particular may be affected by economic conditions in the far east, and all of our nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions in the united states, and california in particular. a recession, economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition affecting consumers or corporations generally is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts,

15
which would adversely affect our operating results. for example, the prior recession and downturn in consumer and corporate spending had a negative impact on our results of operations.

in addition, since we expect a significant number of customers to come to mgm macau from mainland china, general economic and market conditions in china could impact our financial prospects. any slowdown in economic growth or changes to china's current restrictions on travel and currency conversion or movements, including market impacts resulting from china's recent anti-corruption campaign and related tightening of liquidity provided by non-bank lending entities and cross-border currency monitoring (including increased restrictions on union pay withdrawals and other atm limits on the withdrawal of patacas imposed by the government), could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland china to mgm macau and/or the amounts they are willing to spend in the casino. for example, from 2008 through 2010, china readjusted its visa policy toward macau and limited the number of visits that some mainland chinese citizens may make to macau in a given time period. in addition, effective october 2013, china banned "zero‐fare" tour groups involving no or low up-front payments and compulsory shopping, which were popular among visitors to macau from mainland china, and in december 2014 the chinese government tightened the enforcement of visa transit rules for those seeking to enter macau at the gongbei border (including requirements to present an airplane ticket to a destination country, a visa issued by such destination country and a valid chinese passport). it is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect, become more restrictive, or be readopted in the future. these developments have had, and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have, the effect of reducing the number of visitors to macau from mainland china, which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in macau.
furthermore, our operations in macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources. our success in macau will be impacted by our ability to retain and hire employees. we compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition will grow in light of new developments in macau. while we seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resorts, certain macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications (for instance, the macau government requires that we only hire macau residents as dealers in our casinos) and any future government policies that freeze or cancel our ability to import labor could cause labor costs to increase. in addition, limitations on the number of gaming tables permitted by the macau government could impact our current expectation on the number of table games we will be able to utilize at our cotai project. such limitations or reduction in table game availability may impact mgm china's results of operations. finally, because additional casino projects are under construction and are to be developed in the future, existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to macau. if transportation facilities to and from macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting macau, the desirability of macau as a gaming destination, as well as the results of operations at our development in cotai, macau, could be negatively impacted.
•   we may not be able to sustain continued improvements as a result of our profit growth plan. in 2015, we commenced an initiative for sustained growth and margin enhancement, focused on improving our business processes to optimize scale for greater efficiency and lower costs throughout our business. while we believe these initiatives will continue to result in adjusted ebitda benefit, our optimization efforts may fail to achieve expected results or we may not be able to sustain our historic efforts to produce continuous improvements. in addition, while we expect to continue to explore additional opportunities to drive further improvement to our business processes, we may not be able to achieve the historic adjusted ebitda benefits at the same rate (or at all) and we may not be able to institutionalize the continuous improvement business practices that developed in connection with implementing the profit growth plan.

•   our ability to pay ongoing regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure, existing and future debt agreements entered into by us or our subsidiaries and state law requirements. we intend to pay ongoing regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. however, our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. in addition, our ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain covenants in our credit agreement, and because we are a holding company with no material direct operations, we are dependent on receiving cash from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds from operations necessary to pay dividends on our common stock. we expect our subsidiaries will continue to generate significant cash flow necessary to maintain quarterly dividend payments on our common stock, however, their ability to generate funds will be subject to their operating results, cash requirements and financial condition, any applicable provisions of state law that may limit the amount of funds available to us, and compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future agreements governing any indebtedness at such subsidiaries and any limitations in other agreements such subsidiaries may have with third parties. in addition, each of the companies in our corporate chain must manage its assets, liabilities and working capital in order to meet all of their respective cash obligations. as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, future dividend payments may be reduced or eliminated. any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

16
•   a significant number of our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination, lease extensions, charges and our relationship with the lessor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. we lease ten of our destination resorts and the park from a subsidiary of mgp pursuant to the master lease. the master lease has a term of ten years with up to four additional five year extensions, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. the master lease is commonly known as a triple-net lease. accordingly, in addition to rent, we are required to pay the following, among other things: (1) all facility maintenance, (2) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor), (4) all capital expenditures, and (5) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. we are responsible for paying for these expenses notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall accrue in part to mgp as owner of the associated facilities. in addition, if some of our leased facilities should prove to be unprofitable or experience other issues that would warrant ceasing operations or if we should otherwise decide to exit a particular property, we would remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under the master lease even if we decided to cease operations at those locations unless we are able to transfer the rights with respect to a particular property in accordance with the requirements of the master lease. our ability to transfer our obligations under the master lease to a third-party with respect to individual properties, should we decide to withdraw from a particular location, is limited to non-las vegas properties and no more than two las vegas gaming properties and is subject to identifying a willing third-party who meets the requirements for a transferee set forth in the master lease. we may be unable to find an appropriate transferee willing to assume the obligations under the master lease with respect to any such property. in addition, we could incur special charges relating to the closing of such facilities including sublease termination costs, impairment charges and other special charges that would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, our obligation to pay rent as well as the other costs described above is absolute in virtually all circumstances, regardless of the performance of the properties and other circumstances that might abate rent in leases that now place these risks on the tenant, such as certain events of casualty and condemnation.

•   any financial, operational, regulatory or other potential challenges that may arise with respect to mgp, as our sole lessor for a significant portion of our business, may adversely impair our operations. we lease a substantial number of the properties that we operate and manage, which represent a significant portion of our operations, from mgp under the master lease. if mgp has financial, operational, regulatory or other challenges, there can be no assurance that mgp will be able to comply with its obligations under the master lease or its other agreements with us. failure on the part of mgp to fulfill its commitments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

•   james j. murren, our chairman, daniel j. taylor, one of our directors, and william j. hornbuckle, elisa c. gois, and john m. mcmanus, members of our senior management, may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions at mgp. james j. murren serves as our chairman and as the chairman of mgp. in addition, daniel j. taylor, one of our directors, is also a director of mgp and william j. hornbuckle, elisa c. gois, and john m. mcmanus, members of our senior management, are also directors of mgp. while we have procedures in place to address such situations and the organizational documents with respect to mgp contain provisions that reduce or eliminate duties (including fiduciary duties) to any mgp shareholder to the fullest extent permitted by law, these overlapping positions could nonetheless create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our or mgp's management and directors pursue the same corporate opportunities, such as potential acquisition targets, or face decisions that could have different implications for us and mgp. further, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and mgp (or its subsidiaries) regarding the terms of the agreements governing the separation and the relationship, between us and mgp, such as under the master lease. potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we and mgp enter into any commercial or other adverse arrangements with each other in the future.

•   despite our ability to exercise control over the affairs of mgp as a result of our ownership of the single outstanding class b share of mgp, mgp has adopted a policy under which certain transactions with us, including transactions involving consideration in excess of $25 million, must be approved by a conflicts committee comprised of independent directors of mgp, which could affect our ability to execute our operational and strategic objectives. we own the single outstanding class b share of mgp. the class b share is a non-economic interest in mgp which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of mgp or upon liquidation or winding up of mgp and which represents a majority of the voting power of mgp's shares so long as the holder of the class b share and its controlled affiliates' (excluding mgp) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in mgp and the operating partnership does not fall below 30%. we, therefore, have the ability to exercise significant control over mgp's affairs, including control over the outcome of all matters submitted to mgp's shareholders for approval.

17
mgp's operating agreement, however, provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between us or any of our affiliates (other than mgp and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and mgp or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, any resolution or course of action by mgp's board of directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to mgp if it is (i) approved by a majority of a conflicts committee which consists solely of "independent" directors (which mgp refers to as "special approval") (such independence determined in accordance with the nyse's listing standards, the standards established by the exchange act to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors and certain additional independence requirements in our operating agreement), (ii) determined by mgp's board of directors to be fair and reasonable to mgp or (iii) approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of mgp's outstanding voting shares (excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates). furthermore, that mgp's operating agreement provides that any transaction with a value, individually or in the aggregate, over $25 million between us or any of our affiliates (other than mgp and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and mgp or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand (any such transaction (other than the exercise of rights by us or any of our affiliates (other than mgp and its subsidiaries) under any of the material agreements entered into on the closing day of mgp's formation transactions), a "threshold transaction"), shall be permitted only if (i) special approval is obtained or (ii) such transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of mgp's outstanding voting shares (excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates).
as a result, certain transactions, including any threshold transactions that we may want to pursue with mgp and that could have significant benefit to us may require special approval. there can be no assurance that the required approval will be obtained with respect to these transactions either from a conflicts committee comprised of independent mgp directors or the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares not held by us and our affiliates. the failure to obtain such requisite consent could materially affect our ability and the cost to execute our operational and strategic objectives.
•   we have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in china, macau, hong kong and taiwan, other than through mgm china. in connection with the initial public offering of mgm china, the holding company that indirectly owns and operates mgm macau, we entered into a deed of non-compete undertakings with mgm china and ms. ho, pansy catilina chiu king ("ms. ho") pursuant to which we are restricted from having any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the people's republic of china, macau, hong kong and taiwan, other than through mgm china. while gaming is currently prohibited in china, hong kong and taiwan, if it is legalized in the future our ability to compete in these locations could be limited until the earliest of (i) march 31, 2020, (ii) the date mgm china's ordinary shares cease to be listed on the stock exchange of hong kong limited or (iii) the date when our ownership of mgm china shares is less than 20% of the then-issued share capital of mgm china.

•   the macau government can terminate mgm grand paradise's subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating mgm grand paradise, exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession in 2017 or refuse to grant mgm grand paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2020, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate the subconcession in the event of fundamental non-compliance by mgm grand paradise with applicable macau laws or mgm grand paradise's basic obligations under the subconcession contract. mgm grand paradise has the opportunity to remedy any such non-compliance with its fundamental obligations under the subconcession contract within a period to be stipulated by the macau government. upon such termination, all of mgm grand paradise's casino area premises and gaming-related equipment would be transferred automatically to the macau government without compensation to mgm grand paradise, and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations. we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will perform all of its obligations under the subconcession contract in a way that satisfies the requirements of the macau government.

furthermore, under the subconcession contract, mgm grand paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the macau government might promulgate in the future. we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our macau businesses. if any disagreement arises between mgm grand paradise and the macau government regarding the interpretation of, or mgm grand paradise's compliance with, a provision of the subconcession contract, mgm grand paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the macau government. during any consultation or negotiation, mgm grand paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the macau government. currently, there is no precedent concerning how the macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above. the loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in macau, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

in addition, the subconcession contract expires on march 31, 2020. unless the subconcession is extended, or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended, all of mgm grand paradise's casino premises and gaming-related equipment will automatically be transferred to the macau government on that date without compensation to us, and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations. beginning on april 20, 2017, the macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one year's prior notice. in the event the macau government exercises this redemption right, mgm grand paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. the amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and non-gaming revenue generated by mgm grand paradise, excluding the convention and exhibition facilities, during the taxable year prior to the redemption, before deducting interest, depreciation and amortization, multiplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession. we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to renew or extend the subconcession contract on terms favorable to mgm grand paradise or at all. we also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed, the compensation paid to mgm grand paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues.
•   we are required to build and open our development in cotai, macau by january 2018. if we are unable to meet this deadline, and the deadline for the development is not extended, we may lose the land concession, which would prohibit us from operating any facilities developed under such land concession. the land concession for the approximately 18 acre site on cotai, macau was officially gazetted on january 9, 2013. if we are unable to build and open our proposed resort and casino by january 2018, and the deadline is not extended, the macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate the land concession contract. although mgm cotai is expected to open in the second half of 2017, there can be no assurances that the opening will occur within the anticipated timeframe. a loss of the land concession could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

•   mgm grand paradise is dependent upon gaming promoters for a significant portion of gaming revenues in macau. gaming promoters, who promote gaming and draw high-end customers to casinos, are responsible for a significant portion of mgm grand paradise's gaming revenues in macau. with the rise in gaming in macau and the recent reduction in the number of licensed gaming promoters in macau and in the number of vip rooms operated by licensed gaming promoters, the competition for relationships with gaming promoters has increased. while mgm grand paradise is undertaking initiatives to strengthen relationships with gaming promoters, there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain, or grow, relationships with gaming promoters. in addition, continued reductions in, and new regulations governing, the gaming promoter segment may result in the closure of additional vip rooms in macau, including vip rooms at mgm macau. if mgm grand paradise is unable to maintain or grow relationships with gaming promoters, or if gaming promoters are unable to develop or maintain relationships with our high-end customers (or if, as a result of recent market conditions in macau, gaming promoters encounter difficulties attracting patrons to come to macau or experience decreased liquidity limiting their ability to grant credit to patrons), mgm grand paradise's ability to grow gaming revenues will be hampered. furthermore, if existing vip rooms at mgm macau are closed there can be no assurance that mgm grand paradise will be able to locate acceptable gaming promoters to run such vip rooms in the future in a timely manner, or at all.

in addition, the quality of gaming promoters is important to mgm grand paradise's and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance with gaming licenses. while mgm grand paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters, we cannot assure you that the gaming promoters with whom mgm grand paradise is or becomes associated will meet the high standards insisted upon. if a gaming promoter falls below mgm grand paradise's standards, mgm grand paradise or we may suffer reputational harm or possibly sanctions from gaming regulators with authority over our operations.
we also grant credit lines to certain gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance of those gaming promoters may impact the recoverability of these loans.
•   the future recognition of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is uncertain, and the amount of valuation allowance we may apply against such deferred tax asset may change materially in future periods. we currently have significant foreign tax credit deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce potential taxable foreign-sourced income in future periods. we evaluate our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset for recoverability and record a valuation allowance to the extent that we determine it is not more likely than not such asset will be recovered. this evaluation is based on all available evidence, including assumptions about operating profits in the u.s. and abroad. as a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance and changes to our assumptions may have a material impact on the amount of the valuation allowance. for example, a change to our forecasts of future profitability of and distributions from mgm china or a change in our assumptions concerning future u.s. operating profits could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in such period. in addition, a renewal in a future period of the exemption from macau's 12% complementary tax on gaming profits could have a material impact on the provision for income taxes in such period.

19
finally, changes in u.s. tax law under consideration as part of broader corporate tax reform, namely a change from a worldwide to a territorial tax system, could eliminate our ability to utilize some portion or all of our foreign tax credits in future periods and such change could result in a material change in the valuation allowance, or elimination of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset in its entirety, with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in the period of such change.

•   extreme weather conditions or climate change may cause property damage or interrupt business, which could harm our business and results of operations. certain of our casino properties are located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather conditions, including, but not limited to, hurricanes in the united states and severe typhoons in macau. such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations, damage our properties, and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas. in addition, our operations could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water shortage. a severe drought of extensive duration experienced in las vegas or in the other regions in which we operate could adversely affect our business and results of operations. although we maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage for certain extreme weather conditions, such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from such extreme weather conditions. furthermore, such extreme weather conditions may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties and may cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

•   because a majority of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the las vegas strip, we are subject to greater risks than a gaming company that is more geographically diversified. given that a majority of our major resorts are concentrated on the las vegas strip, our business may be significantly affected by risks common to the las vegas tourism industry. for example, the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from las vegas can adversely affect our business. we cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from las vegas, but we rely on air traffic for a significant portion of our visitors. reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand can impact the number of visitors to our resorts. additionally, there is one principal interstate highway between las vegas and southern california, where a large number of our customers reside. capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities.

•   we extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables. we conduct a portion of our gaming activities on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments. table games players typically are issued more markers than slot players, and high-end players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. high-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter. furthermore, the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these high-end customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we issue markers to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. in addition, mgm grand paradise extends credit to certain gaming promoters and those promoters can extend credit to their customers. uncollectible receivables from high-end customers and gaming promoters could have a significant impact on our results of operations.

while gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of nevada, and nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the full faith and credit clause of the u.s. constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the u.s. of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from united states courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.
furthermore, we expect that mgm macau will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including macau. to the extent mgm macau gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions, mgm macau may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and mgm macau may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts. moreover, under applicable law, mgm macau remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers.
even where gaming debts are enforceable, they may not be collectible. our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.
20
•   we may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets which could negatively affect our future profits. we review our goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets on an annual basis and during interim reporting periods in accordance with the authoritative guidance. significant negative trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth have resulted in write-downs and impairment charges in the past and, if one or more of such events occurs in the future, additional impairment charges or write-downs may be required in future periods. for instance, in 2015, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.5 billion to reduce the historical carrying value of goodwill related to the mgm china reporting unit. if we are required to record additional impairment charges or write-downs, this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations.

•   leisure and business travel, especially travel by air, are particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events, such as terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility. we are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air. since most of our customers travel by air to our las vegas and macau properties, any terrorist act, outbreak of hostilities, escalation of war, or any actual or perceived threat to the security of travel by air could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. furthermore, although we have been able to purchase some insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts, insurance coverage against loss or business interruption resulting from war and some forms of terrorism continues to be unavailable.

•   co-investing in our properties, including our investment in citycenter, decreases our ability to manage risk. in addition to acquiring or developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, we have from time to time invested, and expect to continue to invest, as a co-investor. co-investors often have shared control over the operation of the property. therefore, the operation of such properties is subject to inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters. in addition, investments with other investors may involve risks such as the possibility that the co-investor might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations, or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives. consequently, actions by a co-investor might subject hotels and resorts owned by such entities to additional risk. further, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our co-investors. alternatively, our co-investors could take actions binding on the property without our consent. additionally, should a co-investor become bankrupt, we could become liable for its share of liabilities.

for instance, citycenter, which is 50% owned and managed by us, has a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations. if citycenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our co-investor are unable to support future funding requirements, as necessary, such event could have adverse financial consequences to us. in addition, the agreements governing citycenter's indebtedness subject citycenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on its ability to incur additional indebtedness, place liens upon assets, make distributions to us, make certain investments, consummate certain asset sales, enter into transactions with affiliates (including us) and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets. the citycenter third amended and restated credit facility also includes certain financial covenants that require citycenter to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio (as defined in citycenter's third amended and restated credit facility) for each quarter. we cannot be sure that citycenter will be able to meet this test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test.
•   any of our future construction, development or expansion projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks, which could have a material adverse impact on related project timetables, costs and our ability to complete the projects.

any of our future construction, development or expansion projects will be subject to a number of risks, including:
•   lack of sufficient, or delays in the availability of, financing;

•   changes to plans and specifications;

•   engineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;

•   shortages of, and price increases in, energy, materials and skilled and unskilled labor, and inflation in key supply markets;

•   delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals;

•   changes in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations, applicable to gaming, leisure, residential, real estate development or construction projects;

•   labor disputes or work stoppages;

•   availability of qualified contractors and subcontractors;

21
•   disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;

•   personal injuries to workers and other persons;

•   environmental, health and safety issues, including site accidents and the spread of viruses;

•   weather interferences or delays;

•   fires, typhoons and other natural disasters;

•   geological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems; and

•   other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.

the occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs, delay or prevent the construction, development, expansion or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future projects which we might undertake. for instance, we currently expect the total development costs of our cotai project to be approximately $3.3 billion, excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation, capitalized interest and land-related costs, and we currently expect total development costs of our massachusetts project to be approximately $865 million, excluding capitalized interest and land-related costs. while we believe that the overall budgets for these developments are reasonable, these development costs are estimates and the actual development costs may be higher than expected. we cannot guarantee that our construction costs or total project costs for future projects, including our developments in cotai and massachusetts, will not increase beyond amounts initially budgeted or that the expected design and features of current or future projects will not change. in addition, the regulatory approvals associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meet those deadlines, and any such deadlines are not extended, we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction or incur payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
•   our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer. in addition, our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future. although we have "all risk" property insurance coverage for our operating properties, which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism), each policy has certain exclusions. in addition, our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss. our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty. in addition, certain casualty events, such as labor strikes; nuclear events; acts of war; loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism; loss of electrical power due to catastrophic events, rolling blackouts or otherwise; deterioration or corrosion; insect or animal damage; and pollution, may not be covered at all under our policies. therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.

in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed. while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance, this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event.
we renew our insurance policies (other than our builder's risk insurance) on an annual basis. the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits, further increase our deductibles, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.
•   any failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business. the development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success. while our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one trademark or combination of several of our trademarks or other intellectual property, we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations through the use of trademarks. we file applications for, and obtain trademarks in, the united states and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states. monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resource. we cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the united states and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others. the unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.

•   tracinda owns a significant amount of our common stock and may be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval. as of february 21, 2017, tracinda corporation beneficially owned approximately 12% of

22
our outstanding common stock and as a result, tracinda may be able to exercise significant influence over any matter requiring stockholder approval, including the approval of significant corporate transactions. upon mr. kirk kerkorian's passing, tracinda's position in our common stock became subject to the terms of mr. kerkorian's last will and testament, which provides for an orderly disposition of tracinda's position in our common stock. as a result, while we expect that tracinda's ownership of our common stock will decline in the future, tracinda has not indicated when, if or how it intends to sell its position in our common stock.

•   we are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states. our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under non-united states laws, regulations and customs. in particular, the risks associated with the operation of mgm macau or any future operations in which we may engage in any other foreign territories, include:

•   changes in laws and policies that govern operations of companies in macau or other foreign jurisdictions;

•   changes in non-united states government programs;

•   possible failure by our employees or agents to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;

•   general economic conditions and policies in china, including restrictions on travel and currency movements;

•   difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-united states operations;

•   different labor regulations;

•   changes in environmental, health and safety laws;

•   outbreaks of diseases or epidemics;

•   potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;

•   political instability and actual or anticipated military and political conflicts;

•   economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; and

•   uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures.

these risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we are also exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. if the united states dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries, our united states dollar reported income from sources where revenue is dominated in the currencies of other such countries will decrease.
•   any violation of the foreign corrupt practices act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us. a significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the united states, which exposes us to complex foreign and u.s. regulations inherent in doing cross-border business and in each of the countries in which we transact business. we are subject to compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa") and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. while our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. violations of these laws by us or our non-controlled ventures may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties against us, and the sec and u.s. department of justice continue to vigorously pursue enforcement of the fcpa. the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.

•   we face risks related to pending claims that have been, or future claims that may be, brought against us. claims have been brought against us and our subsidiaries in various legal proceedings, and additional legal and tax claims arise from time to time. we may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of our current or future legal proceedings, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. please see the further discussion in "legal proceedings" and note 13 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

•   a significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements. work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively affect our business and results of operations. as of december 31, 2016, approximately 34,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. a prolonged dispute with the covered employees or any labor unrest, strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or others could have an adverse impact on our operations. further, adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. also, wage and/or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, to the extent that our non-union employees join unions, we would have greater exposure to risks associated with labor problems.

23
furthermore, we may have, or acquire in the future, multi-employer plans that are classified as "endangered," "seriously endangered," or "critical" status. for instance, borgata's most significant plan is the legacy plan of the national retirement fund, former hereiu and local 54, which has been listed in "critical status" and is subject to a rehabilitation plan. plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. in addition, while borgata has no current intention to withdraw from these plans, a withdrawal in the future could result in the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in an amount and at such time (or over a period of time) that would vary based on a number of factors at the time of (and after) withdrawal. any such additional costs may be significant.

•   our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results. we are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. accordingly, increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results. additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues.

•   the failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and internal customer information could result in damage of reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. we collect and store information relating to our employees and guests for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. the collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the united states and other jurisdictions around the world. privacy regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another.

compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests. in addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us), including accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage of reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. we rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of customer and employee information, such as payment card and other confidential or proprietary information. our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly; however, they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats. in addition, while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist in the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event, such coverage may not be sufficient.
we also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information and manage our businesses. disruptions in the availability of our computer systems, through cyber attacks or otherwise, could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations. for instance, there has been an increase in criminal cyber security attacks against companies where customer and company information has been compromised and company data has been destroyed. our information systems and records, including those we maintain with our third-party service providers, may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future. in addition, our third-party information system service providers face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours, and we do not directly control any of such parties' information security operations. a significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a third-party service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation, cause a material disruption to our operations and management team, and result in remediation expenses, regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other parties whose information was subject to such attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.
•   we may seek to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances or acquisitions, and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets, any of which may be unsuccessful. we intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions and investments in other businesses, properties or other assets. furthermore, we may pursue any of these opportunities in alliance with third parties, including mgp. acquisitions and investments in businesses, properties or assets, as well as these alliances, are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to:

•   spending cash and incurring debt;

•   assuming contingent liabilities;

•   unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;

•   unanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;

•   retaining key employees; and

24
•   consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that we will actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions, investments or alliances.
in addition, we periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are non-core, no longer complement our business, are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets or could be sold at significant premiums. from time to time, we may attempt to sell these identified properties and assets. there can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
•   if the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees, our results could be adversely affected. state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities. from time to time, legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. periods of economic downturn or uncertainty and budget deficits may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes. if the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase gaming taxes or fees, depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. for instance, income generated from gaming operations of mgm grand paradise currently has the benefit of a corporate tax exemption in macau, which exempts us from paying the 12% complementary tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games. this exemption is effective through march 31, 2020, which also runs concurrent with the end of the term of the current gaming subconcession. due to the uncertainty concerning taxation after the subconcession renewal process, we cannot assure you that any extensions of the tax exemption will be granted beyond march 31, 2020.

•   conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of mgm china, the holding company for mgm grand paradise which owns and operates mgm macau. as a result of the initial public offering of shares of mgm china common stock, mgm china now has stockholders who are not affiliated with us, and we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers and/or directors of mgm china may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of mgm china. decisions that could have different implications for us and mgm china, including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with mgm china, may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest or an actual conflict of interest.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

executive overview our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings. we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, las vegas visitor volume increased 1%, las vegas strip revpar increased 6% and las vegas strip gaming revenue increased by less than 1% compared to the prior year period according to information published by the las vegas convention and visitors authority. results of operations for our domestic resorts during 2016 benefited from an increase in operating margins resulting from increases in gaming revenue and revpar, and the results of our profit growth plan, discussed below. our rooms revenue benefited from increased visitation to the las vegas market and robust convention business at our las vegas strip resorts, which allowed us to yield higher room rates across our portfolio of resorts.
gross gaming revenues in the macau market decreased 3% in 2016 compared to 2015, and gross gaming revenues decreased 34% in 2015 compared to 2014. as a significant number of mgm macau's customers are from mainland china, we believe operating results were negatively affected by economic conditions in mainland china as well as certain policy initiatives in mainland china and macau. specifically, a continuing slowdown in china's economic growth rate, the chinese government's restrictions on travel and cross-border currency transactions, new compliance regulations for gaming promoters and gaming operators enacted by the macau government and implemented in late 2015 and in 2016 and a ban on mobile phone usage at gaming tables in an attempt to eliminate "proxy" bets have all negatively affected mgm macau's high-end customers and the gaming promoters with which we conduct our vip casino gaming operations. in addition, the chinese government's anti-corruption campaign has changed consumption patterns and affected the propensity of our clients to spend on certain areas like gaming or luxury items. the macau government also implemented a full main floor casino smoking ban in october 2014. these factors led to a continued decrease in gross gaming revenues for the macau market beginning in the second half of 2014 and lasted into 2016 primarily impacting vip casino gaming operations and, to a lesser extent, main floor operations throughout the macau market. despite concerns over the recent events and the sustainability of economic growth in china, we expect the macau market to grow on a long-term basis due to further development, penetration of the mainland china market and infrastructure improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within macau, and we believe recent trends reflect stabilization within the macau market. according to statistics published by the statistics and census service of the macau government, after several quarters of declines in visitation throughout 2015, visitor arrivals increased slightly by 1% and overnight visitors increased 10% in 2016 compared to 2015. additionally, gross gaming revenue increased year over year in each of the months from august 2016 through december 2016.
our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access to capital and our cost of capital. while we continue to be focused on improving our financial position, we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities. in macau, we estimate costs to develop mgm cotai will be approximately $3.3 billion, excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation, capitalized interest and land related costs. mgm cotai is a casino resort with capacity for up to 500 gaming tables and up to 1,500 slots, and featuring approximately 1,500 hotel rooms, built on an approximately 18 acre site on the cotai strip in macau. the actual number of gaming tables allocated to mgm cotai will be determined by the macau government prior to opening, and such allocation is expected to be less than our 500 gaming table capacity. mgm cotai is expected to open in the second half of 2017.
we were awarded a casino license to build and operate mgm springfield in springfield, massachusetts. mgm springfield will be developed on approximately 14 acres of land in downtown springfield. mgm's plans for the resort currently include a casino with approximately 3,000 slots and 100 table games including poker; a 250-room hotel; 100,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space; 44,000 square feet of meeting and event space; and a 3,375-space parking garage; with an expected development and construction cost of approximately $865 million, excluding capitalized interest and land-related costs. construction of mgm springfield is expected to be completed in late 2018.
in august 2015, we announced the implementation of a profit growth plan for sustained growth and margin enhancement. the profit growth plan's initiatives focused on improving business processes to leverage our scale for greater efficiency and lower costs, and to identify areas of opportunity to organically drive incremental revenue growth. the profit growth plan included a large number of initiatives to optimize operations and we continue to explore additional opportunities to drive further improvement. in june 2016,

we announced that we expect to achieve approximately $400 million of annualized adjusted ebitda benefit compared to our baseline, which we expect to be fully realized by the end of 2017.
formation and initial public offering of mgp on april 25, 2016, mgm growth properties llc ("mgp") completed its ipo of 57,500,000 of its class a shares representing limited liability company interests (inclusive of the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase 7,500,000 class a shares) at an initial offering price of $21 per share. mgp used the proceeds from the ipo to purchase operating partnership units in mgm growth properties operating partnership lp (the "operating partnership"), to which we contributed the real estate assets associated with the mirage, mandalay bay, luxor, new york-new york, monte carlo, excalibur, the park, gold strike tunica, mgm grand detroit and beau rivage in exchange for operating partnership units in the operating partnership in connection with the ipo.
mgp is organized as an umbrella partnership reit (commonly referred to as an "upreit") structure in which substantially all of its assets are owned by, and substantially all of its businesses are conducted through the operating partnership. mgp contributed the proceeds from the ipo to the operating partnership in exchange for 26.7% of the units in the operating partnership. the general partner of the operating partnership is also a wholly-owned subsidiary of mgp. as a result, mgp controls and consolidates the operating partnership. mgp has two classes of authorized and outstanding voting common shares (collectively, the "shares"): class a shares and a single class b share. we own mgp's class b share, which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of mgp or upon liquidation or winding up of mgp. mgp's class a shareholders are entitled to one vote per share, while we, as the owner of the class b share, are entitled to an amount of votes representing a majority of the total voting power of mgp's shares so long as our and our controlled affiliates' (excluding mgp) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in mgp and the operating partnership does not fall below 30%. as such, we control mgp through our majority voting rights and consolidate mgp in our financial results. subsequent to our acquisition of borgata and subsequent contribution of borgata's real estate assets to mgp as discussed below, our ownership in the operating partnership, increased from 73.3% to 76.3%. as a result of the borgata transaction, mgp's ownership in the operating partnership was correspondingly reduced from 26.7% to 23.7%.
in connection with the formation of mgp, we borrowed $4.0 billion under certain bridge facilities, the proceeds of which were used to repay outstanding obligations under our prior senior credit facility and to redeem our 7.5% senior notes due 2016 and our 10% senior notes due 2016. the bridge facilities were subsequently assumed by the operating partnership pursuant to the master contribution agreement. the operating partnership repaid the bridge facilities with a combination of proceeds from certain financing transactions and the proceeds from the ipo.
acquisition of borgata hotel casino & spa on august 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of boyd gaming corporation's ("boyd gaming") ownership interest in borgata, at which time borgata became a consolidated subsidiary of ours. accordingly, we recorded a gain of approximately $430 million as a result of the acquisition of borgata and resulting consolidation of borgata, which we previously accounted for under the equity method. see note 4 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. following completion of the acquisition, mgp subsequently acquired borgata's real property from a subsidiary of ours in exchange for mgp's assumption of $545 million of indebtedness from our subsidiary and the issuance of $27.4 million operating partnership units to our subsidiary. in connection with the borgata transaction, we borrowed $545 million under certain bridge facilities, which were subsequently contributed to the operating partnership. the operating partnership repaid the bridge facilities with a combination of cash on hand and a draw down on their revolving credit facility, which it subsequently refinanced with proceeds from its offering of its 4.5% senior notes due 2026. pursuant to an amendment to the master lease, mgp leased back the real property of borgata to a subsidiary of ours and as a result, initial rent payments to mgp increased by $100 million, prorated for the remainder of the first lease year after the borgata transaction. consistent with the master lease terms, 90% of this rent is fixed and will contractually grow at 2% per year until 2022.
reportable segments we have two reportable segments: domestic resorts and mgm china. we currently own and operate 14 resorts in the united states. mgm china's operations consist of mgm macau resort and the development of mgm cotai on the cotai strip in macau. we have additional business activities including investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and certain other corporate and management operations. citycenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate, which we also manage for a fee. our operations that are not segregated into separate reportable segments are reported as "corporate and other" operations in our reconciliations of segment results to consolidated results.

domestic resorts. at december 31, 2016, our domestic resorts consisted of the following casino resorts:
las vegas, nevada:              bellagio, mgm grand las vegas (including the signature), mandalay bay (including delano and four seasons), the mirage, luxor, new york-new york, excalibur, monte carlo and circus circus las vegas.

other:               mgm grand detroit in detroit, michigan; beau rivage in biloxi, mississippi; gold strike tunica in tunica, mississippi; borgata in atlantic city, new jersey; and mgm national harbor in prince george's county, maryland.
over half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is derived from non-gaming operations including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other non-gaming amenities. we market to different customer groups and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes which also leads to better labor utilization. our operating results are highly dependent on demand for our services, and the volume of customers at our resorts, which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities. also, we generate a significant portion of our revenue from our domestic resorts in las vegas, nevada, which exposes us to certain risks, such as increased competition from new or expanded las vegas resorts, and from the expansion of gaming in the united states generally.
key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue at our domestic resorts are:
•   gaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); "win" or "hold" percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. our normal table games hold percentage is in the range of 19% to 23% of table games drop and our normal slots hold percentage is in the range of 8.5% to 9% of slots handle; and

•   hotel revenue indicators: hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate ("adr," a price indicator); and revenue per available room ("revpar," a summary measure of hotel results, combining adr and occupancy rate). our calculation of adr, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or "cash" rates for each customer segment and each type of room product to estimate complimentary rates which are consistent with retail rates. complimentary rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions. because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite adr including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the adr for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites.

mgm china. subsequent to the acquisition of an additional 4.95% of the outstanding common shares of our mgm china subsidiary in september 2016, we own an approximate 56% controlling interest in mgm china, which owns mgm grand paradise, the macau company that owns and operates mgm macau and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions, and is in the process of developing mgm cotai. we believe our investment in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability.
revenues at mgm macau are generated from three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market: vip casino gaming operations, main floor gaming operations, and slot machine operations. vip players play mostly in dedicated vip rooms or designated gaming areas. vip customers can be further divided into customers sourced by in-house vip programs and those sourced through gaming promoters. a significant portion of our vip volume is generated through the use of gaming promoters. gaming promoters introduce vip gaming players to mgm macau, assist these customers with travel arrangements, and extend gaming credit to these players. in exchange for their services, gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenue-sharing arrangements or rolling chip turnover based commissions. in-house vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate. mgm macau main floor operations primarily consist of walk-in and day trip visitors. unlike gaming promoters and in-house vip players, main floor players do not receive commissions. the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. gaming revenues from the main floor segment have become an increasingly significant portion of total gaming revenues in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future.
vip gaming at mgm macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips from mgm macau and in turn they sell these chips to their players. the nonnegotiable chips allow mgm macau to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters' clients in order to determine vip gaming play. gaming promoter commissions are based on a percentage of the gross table games win or a percentage of the table games turnover they generate. they also receive a complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the table games turnover they generate, which can be applied to hotel rooms, food and beverage and other discretionary customers-related expenses. the estimated portion of the gaming promoter payments that represent amounts passed through to vip customers is recorded as a reduction of casino revenue, and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded as casino expense. in-house vip commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue.
34
in addition to the key performance indicators used by our domestic resorts, mgm macau utilizes "turnover," which is the sum of nonnegotiable chip wagers won by mgm macau calculated as nonnegotiable chips purchased plus nonnegotiable chips exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned. turnover provides a basis for measuring vip casino win percentage. win for vip gaming operations at mgm macau is typically in the range of 2.7% to 3.0% of turnover.
corporate and other. corporate and other includes our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain management and other operations. see note 1 and note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the company's unconsolidated affiliates.
results of operations the following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
summary operating results the following table summarizes our operating results:
year ended december 31,

net revenues                  $9,455,123                    $9,190,068                   $10,081,984
operating income (loss)               2,079,787                     (156,232   )                 1,323,538
consolidated net revenues for 2016 increased 3% compared to 2015 due primarily to the borgata transaction on august 1, 2016, the opening of mgm national harbor in december 2016 and an increase in casino revenue, rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and other revenue including parking fee revenue at our domestic resorts, partially offset by a decrease in casino revenue at mgm china. consolidated net revenues for 2015 decreased 9% compared to 2014 due primarily to a decrease in casino revenue at mgm china, offset by increases in casino and non-casino revenue at our domestic resorts. see "operating results - detailed segment information" below for additional information related to segment revenues.
consolidated operating income of $2.1 billion in 2016 compared to an operating loss of $156 million in 2015. operating income in 2016 benefited from $39 million of operating income from borgata subsequent to the acquisition, a $430 million gain recognized on the borgata transaction, and an increase in income from unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to a $401 million gain related to the sale of crystals at citycenter (see "operating results - income (loss) from unconsolidated affiliates" for further discussion). operating income in 2016 was also negatively affected by charges of $152 million of nv energy exit expense associated with the company's strategic decision to exit the fully bundled sales system of nv energy, which includes expense at our domestic resorts as well as our 50% share of expense recognized at citycenter, an increase in preopening expense, and an increase in corporate expense. see "operating results - details of certain charges" below for additional detail on our preopening expense. corporate expense increased to $313 million in 2016, due primarily to costs incurred to implement initiatives related to the profit growth plan of $23 million, costs associated with the initial public offering of mgp of $25 million, transaction costs incurred in connection with the borgata transaction, incremental performance-based compensation expense, and costs associated with a litigation settlement.
consolidated operating loss of $156 million in 2015 was negatively affected by an operating loss for mgm china that included a $1.5 billion non-cash impairment charge to goodwill recognized in the acquisition of a controlling interest in mgm china in 2011. in connection with that acquisition, we recorded a $3.5 billion non-cash gain. the 2015 impairment charge, which represents approximately 42% of the amount of the previously recognized gain, resulted from our annual review of our goodwill carrying values and was incurred as a result of reduced cash flow forecasts for mgm china's resorts based on market conditions at that time and lower valuation multiples for gaming assets in the macau market. in addition, the operating loss was affected by a decrease in operating results at mgm macau. the operating loss for mgm china was partially offset by an increase in operating income at our domestic resorts and an increase in income from unconsolidated affiliates, primarily from citycenter, which included $80 million related to our share of the gain recognized by citycenter as a result of the final resolution of its construction litigation and related settlements. in addition, corporate expense increased 15% to $275 million in 2015, due primarily to costs incurred to implement initiatives in relation to the profit growth plan of $24 million and $20 million in costs associated with the mgp transaction. preopening expense, primarily related to our mgm cotai, mgm springfield and mgm national harbor development projects, increased to $71 million in 2015 compared to $39 million in 2014. consolidated operating loss in 2015 was also negatively affected by impairment charges and losses on disposal of certain assets recorded in "property transactions, net." see "operating results - details of certain changes" below for additional detail related to property transactions.

in 2016, interest cost related to mgm resorts, excluding mgm china, decreased compared to 2015 primarily as a result of a decrease in the average long-term debt outstanding, and also due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate, partially offset by an increase in amortization of debt issuance cost associated with the mgp related financing transactions in april 2016. interest cost related to mgm china increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an increase in the average outstanding amounts borrowed under the mgm china credit facility partially offset by a decrease in amortization of debt issuance costs. in 2015, interest cost related to mgm resorts, excluding china, decreased compared to 2014 as a result of a decrease in the average long-term debt outstanding during the year related to our senior notes. interest cost related to mgm china increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to an increase in the average outstanding amounts borrowed under the mgm china credit facility and an increase in the amortization of debt issuance costs resulting from costs incurred associated with the refinancing of the mgm china credit facility in june 2015.

non-operating items from unconsolidated affiliates. non-operating expense from unconsolidated affiliates decreased $23 million in 2016 compared to 2015, due primarily to the acquisition of borgata on august 1, 2016, at which time the subsidiary operating borgata became a consolidated subsidiary of our company. prior to the acquisition, we held a 50% ownership interest in borgata, which was accounted for under the equity method. non-operating expense from unconsolidated affiliates decreased $11 million in 2015 compared to 2014, due primarily to a decrease in interest expense at citycenter.
other, net. other expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to a $16 million loss on the early retirement of debt related to the $743 million 7.625% senior notes due 2017, as well as a $49 million loss incurred on the early retirement of debt related to the $1.23 billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 7.5% senior notes due 2016 and 10% senior notes due 2016 and our prior senior credit facility, recorded in the second quarter of 2016.

our effective tax rate in 2016 was favorably impacted by income tax benefits attributable to a decrease in valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryovers and permanent exclusion of a portion of the gain on the borgata transaction, partially offset by income tax expense attributable to the remeasurement of macau deferred tax liabilities resulting from a change in assumption concerning renewal of the exemption from the macau complementary tax on gaming profits. our effective tax rate in 2015 was unfavorably impacted by the non-cash impairment charge on mgm china goodwill for which we did not record income tax benefit. our effective tax rate decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of providing greater tax benefit in 2015 than in 2014 for foreign tax credits, net of valuation allowance, partially offset by tax benefit resulting from audit settlements in 2014.
41
cash taxes paid increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in federal income taxes paid due to increased u.s. taxable income. cash taxes paid decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of a $16 million refund of taxes and associated interest received in 2015 on the closure of the irs examination of citycenter, which is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes which partially offset federal income tax estimated tax payments of $23 million made during the year. the remaining $5 million of cash taxes paid in 2015 consist of state and foreign income taxes.
non-gaap measures
"adjusted ebitda" is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, nv energy exit expense, gain on borgata transaction, goodwill impairment charges, and property transactions, net. "adjusted property ebitda" is adjusted ebitda before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to both the mgm resorts and mgp stock-based compensation plans, which are not allocated to each reportable segment or operating segment, as applicable. mgm china recognizes stock compensation expense related to its stock-based compensation plan which is included in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for mgm china. "same-store adjusted property ebitda" is adjusted property ebitda related to the operating resorts which were consolidated by the company for both the entire current and prior year periods presented. adjusted ebitda and adjusted property ebitda information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because management believes these measures are 1) widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming and hospitality industry, and 2) a principal basis for valuation of gaming and hospitality companies. we present adjusted property ebitda on a "same-store" basis as supplemental information for investors because management believes that providing performance measures on a "same-store" basis is useful for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our domestic casino resorts.
we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitda, adjusted property ebitda and same-store adjusted property ebitda may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented. also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. for example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. in addition, capital allocation, tax planning, financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level. therefore, we use adjusted property ebitda and same-store adjusted property ebitda as the primary measure of domestic resorts operating performance.
adjusted ebitda, adjusted property ebitda or same-store adjusted property ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income, as an indicator of our performance; or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity; or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. we have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda, adjusted property ebitda, or same-store adjusted property ebitda. also, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitda, adjusted property ebitda or same-store adjusted property ebitda information may calculate adjusted ebitda, adjusted property ebitda or same-store adjusted property ebitda in a different manner.

cash flows operating activities. trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in working capital, cash paid for interest, the timing of significant tax payments or refunds, and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates. cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion in 2016 compared to $1.0 billion in 2015. operating cash flows increased in the current period due to an increase in operating income at our domestic resorts and a decrease in cash paid for interest, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes. cash provided by operating activities in the prior year was negatively affected by changes in working capital primarily related to short-term gaming liabilities.

mgm china and mgm grand paradise, as co-borrowers, are parties to a fourth amended and restated credit facility which consists of $1.55 billion of term loans and a $1.45 billion revolving credit facility. the interest rate on the facility fluctuates annually based on hibor plus a margin that ranges between 1.375% and 2.5% based on mgm china's leverage ratio. the credit facility matures in april 2019, with scheduled amortization payments of the term loans beginning in october 2017. the mgm china credit facility is secured by mgm grand paradise's interest in the cotai land use right, and mgm china, mgm grand paradise and their guarantor subsidiaries have granted a security interest in substantially all of their assets to secure the facility.
the mgm china credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants, including that mgm china maintains compliance with a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. mgm china was in compliance with its credit facility covenants at december 31, 2016. in february 2017, the mgm china credit facility was amended to increase the maximum total leverage ratio to 6.00 to 1.00 through december 31, 2017, declining to 5.50 to 1.00 at march 31, 2018, 5.00 to 1.00 at june 30, 2018 and 4.50 to 1.00 at september 30, 2018 and thereafter.
in january 2016, mgm national harbor, llc entered into a credit agreement consisting of a $100 million revolving credit facility and a $425 million term loan facility. the revolving and term loan facilities bear interest at libor plus an applicable rate determined by mgm national harbor, llc's total leverage ratio (2.25% as of december 31, 2016). the term loan and revolving facilities are scheduled to mature in january 2021 and the term loan facilities are subject to scheduled amortization payments on the last day of each calendar quarter beginning the fourth full fiscal quarter following the opening date of mgm national harbor, initially in an amount equal to 1.25% of the aggregate principal balance and increasing to 1.875% and 2.50% of the aggregate principal balance on the last day of the twelfth and sixteenth full fiscal quarters, respectively.
the mgm national harbor credit agreement is secured by a leasehold mortgage on mgm national harbor and substantially all of the existing and future property of mgm national harbor. mandatory prepayments will be required upon the occurrence of certain events, including sales of certain assets, casualty events and the incurrence of certain additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights. in addition, to the extent mgm national harbor generates excess cash flow (as defined in the mgm national harbor credit agreement), a percentage of such excess cash flow (ranging from 0% to 50% based on a total leverage ratio) will be required to be used to prepay the term loan facilities commencing with the fiscal year ending 2017.
the mgm national harbor credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants, including that mgm national harbor, llc and its restricted subsidiaries maintain compliance with a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. mgm national harbor, llc was in compliance with its credit agreement covenants at december 31, 2016.

off balance sheet arrangements our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which consist primarily of our investments in citycenter, grand victoria, and las vegas arena company, llc. we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities, nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions, other than our mgp cash flow hedges. see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. our unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a full-scale resort or other entertainment properties in a manner that minimizes our initial investment. we guarantee the t-mobile arena credit facility as described below. in addition, there are no other provisions in the agreements with our investees which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort.
in conjunction with the las vegas arena company, llc entering into a senior secured credit facility in september 2014, we and aeg each entered into joint and several completion guarantees for the project (which were subsequently terminated in february 2017), as well as a repayment guarantee for the term loan b (which is subject to increases and decreases in the event of a rebalancing of the principal amount of indebtedness between the term loan a and term loan b facilities). as of december 31, 2016, term loan a was $150 million and term loan b was $50 million.
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations as of december 31, 2016:

(1)   estimated interest payments are based on principal amounts and expected maturities of debt outstanding at december 31, 2016 and management's forecasted libor rates for our senior credit facility and hibor rates for the mgm china credit facility. in december 2016, the operating partnership entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan b facility. these interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and have a notional value of $500 million and mature on november 30, 2021. the weighted average fixed rate paid is 1.825%, and the variable rate received resets monthly to the one-month libor subject to a minimum rate of 0.75%.

(2)   the amount for 2017 includes $471 million related to mgm cotai and $39 million and $76 million related to mgm national harbor and mgm springfield, respectively.

(3)   the table above excludes our future lease obligations to a subsidiary of the operating partnership pursuant to the master lease agreement discussed in note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. we own 76.3% of the operating partnership units as of december 31, 2016. mgm national harbor is located on land subject to a long-term ground lease. see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

(4)   approximately $12 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and other tax liabilities are excluded from the table as we cannot reasonably estimate when examination and other activity related to these amounts will conclude or when these amounts will be paid, if ever.

(5)   the amount for 2017 includes $124 million related to employment agreements, $129 million for entertainment agreements and $120 million of open purchase orders. other commitments include various contracted amounts, including information technology, advertising, maintenance and other service agreements. our largest entertainment commitments consist of minimum contractual payments to cirque du soleil, which performs shows at several of our resorts. our contractual commitments for these shows generally do not exceed 12 months and are based on our ability to exercise certain termination rights; however, we expect these shows to continue for longer periods.

while we have significant indebtedness and other obligations, we believe we have the ability to meet known obligations, including principal and interest obligations as well as planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months from the balance sheet date with existing cash and cash deposits, cash flows from operations, dividends and distributions from mgm china and the
50
operating partnership, and availability under our senior credit facility, the mgm china credit facility, the operating partnership credit facility and the mgm national harbor credit facility. we have $138 million of maturities of long-term debt in 2017. see "liquidity and capital resources - other factors affecting liquidity" for further discussion of anticipated uses of cash.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates, where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates, and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates. however, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates.
allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our las vegas resorts. our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well. mgm china extends credit to certain in-house vip gaming customers and gaming promoters. we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts, including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation. markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 53% and 42%, respectively, of our casino accounts receivable at our domestic resorts were owed by customers from the united states. markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 35% and 37%, respectively, of our casino accounts receivable at our domestic resorts were owed by customers from the far east. we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when we issue credit to customers at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the united states. mgm china performs background checks and investigates the credit worthiness of gaming promoters and casino customers prior to issuing credit.
we maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. the provision for doubtful accounts, an operating expense, increases the allowance for doubtful accounts. we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts. at domestic resorts where marker play is not significant, the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances. at domestic resorts where marker play is significant, we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer's financial condition, collection history and any other known information. mgm china specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account, the financial condition and the collection history of the gaming promoter or casino customer.
in addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers at our domestic resorts is affected by a number of factors, including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers' home countries. because individual customer account balances can be significant, the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region's economy occur.
the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables:

percentage of casino accounts outstanding over 180 days                  21    %                   26   %
approximately $35 million and $40 million of casino receivables and $8 million and $9 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to mgm china at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. casino receivables increased in the
51
current year as a result of the borgata transaction and the opening of mgm national harbor. the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has decreased in the current year due to a decrease in the age of outstanding account balances. at december 31, 2016, a 100 basis-point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by $3 million.
fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies property and equipment are stated at cost. for the majority of our property and equipment, cost was determined at the acquisition date based on estimated fair values in connection with the august 2016 borgata acquisition, the june 2011 mgm china acquisition, the april 2005 mandalay acquisition and the may 2000 mirage resorts acquisition. maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. when we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries. in addition, interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project. interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings. capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.
we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment. when constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also may be a matter of judgment. in addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets' estimated useful lives. we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset. whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.
impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets we evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used. several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. for assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. for assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset. for operating assets, fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry. if an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. all recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.
there are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets. first, management must determine the usage of the asset. to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized. assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. this means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets. future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.
on a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment. potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economic factors, significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group, including potential sale. historically, undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin.
we review indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. we perform our annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights, which are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach, and trademarks, which are tested for impairment using the relief-from-royalty method. see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.
52
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. we test goodwill for relevant reporting units for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and in interim periods if circumstances exist such that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. accounting guidance provides entities the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill (commonly referred to as "step zero") in order to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. in performing the step zero analysis we take into account macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, current and forecasted financial performance, entity-specific events, and changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets of reporting units. in addition, management takes into consideration the amount of excess of fair value over carrying value determined in the last quantitative analysis that was performed, as well as the period of time that has passed since the last quantitative analysis. if the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, further quantitative analysis is not required. if the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would proceed to a two-step quantitative analysis.
under the two-step quantitative analysis, goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgeted future results discounted using a weighted average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry, and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an indication of impairment exists and we must proceed to measure an impairment loss, if any. in measuring an impairment loss, the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities and the amount remaining, if any, is the implied fair value of goodwill. if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value then it must be written down to its implied fair value.
with the exception of our mgm china reporting unit, discussed below, none of our other reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2016, 2015 or 2014. for our 2016 annual impairment test, we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our domestic resorts reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. the estimated fair values of reporting units for which we elected to forego the step zero analysis and instead utilized the two-step quantitative analysis were substantially in excess of their carrying values. as discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. if future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge.
during the fourth quarter of 2015, we conducted our annual impairment tests of goodwill by reviewing each of our reporting units, including our mgm china reporting unit. the step one goodwill analysis of the mgm china reporting unit indicated the fair value was less than its carrying value by 4%. the decrease in fair value resulted from a decrease in forecasted cash flows based on then current market conditions and a sustained decline in the enterprise value multiples of the mgm china reporting unit as well as those of the mgm china reporting unit's peer group. as a result of the indication of impairment from the step one analysis, we proceeded to perform a step two impairment analysis to measure the impairment loss. as such, we determined the fair values of all assets of the mgm china reporting unit, including its separately identifiable intangible assets. the fair values of each of the separately identifiable intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by a significant amount, leading to a lower implied fair value of goodwill. therefore, we recorded a $1.5 billion non-cash impairment charge to reduce the historical carrying value of goodwill related to the mgm china reporting unit to its implied fair value in 2015.
there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment. in particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. in addition, the determination of multiples, capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions.
see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment.
impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. if such conditions exist, we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment is indicated and determine whether the impairment is other-than-temporary based on our assessment of relevant factors, including consideration of our intent and ability to retain our investment. we estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of future cash flows and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates, as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group. see note 7 and note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of other-than-temporary impairment charges.
53
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.
as of december 31, 2016, we have a foreign tax credit carryover of $2.8 billion against which we have recorded a valuation allowance of $2.5 billion based upon our assessment of future realization. the foreign tax credits are attributable to the macau special gaming tax which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in macau. because mgm grand paradise is presently exempt from the macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits, we believe that payment of the macau special gaming tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against u.s. taxes.
on september 7, 2016, mgm grand paradise was granted an additional extension of the complementary tax exemption through march 31, 2020, concurrent with the end of the term of its current gaming subconcession. a competitor of mgm grand paradise subsequently received an additional extension of its exemption through march 31, 2020, which also runs concurrent with the end of the term of its current gaming concession. based upon these developments and the uncertainty concerning taxation after the concession renewal process, we have concluded that we can no longer assume that mgm grand paradise will be entitled to additional exemption periods beyond the end of the extension recently granted. thus, for all periods beyond march 31, 2020, we have assumed that mgm grand paradise will pay the macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits and will thus not be able to credit the macau special gaming tax in such years, and have factored that assumption into our assessment of the realization of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset and the measurement of macau deferred tax liabilities.
due to improvements in our u.s. operations, we have generated u.s. operating profits for the past eight consecutive quarters and as of june 30, 2016 we no longer had cumulative u.s. losses in recent years. consequently, during 2016 we began to rely on future u.s. source operating income in assessing future foreign tax credit realization during the 10-year foreign tax credit carryover period.
our assessment of realization of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is based on available evidence, including assumptions about future profitability of and distributions from mgm china and assumptions concerning future u.s. operating profits. as a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to our assumptions may have a material impact on the amount of the valuation allowance. for example, a change to our forecasts of future profitability of and distributions from mgm china or a change in our assumptions concerning u.s. profitability could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in such period. in addition, should we in a future period actually receive an additional exemption from the complementary tax, an additional valuation allowance would likely need to be provided on some portion or all of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset, resulting in an increase in the provision for income taxes in such period and such increase may be material.
in addition, there is a $3 million valuation allowance, after federal effect, provided on certain state deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance of $71 million on certain macau deferred tax assets, and a valuation allowance of $2 million on hong kong net operating losses because we believe these assets do not meet the "more likely than not" criteria for recognition.
we file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material. our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service ("irs") and other tax authorities. positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities. see note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities.
we assess our tax positions using a two-step process. a tax position is recognized if it meets a "more likely than not" threshold, and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized. uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date. liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts, and are classified as current in "other accrued liabilities" or long-term in "other long-term liabilities" based on the time until expected payment. additionally, we recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
stock-based compensation we account for stock options and stock appreciation rights ("sars") measuring fair value using the black-scholes model. for restricted share units ("rsus"), compensation expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant.

we account for performance stock units ("psus") measuring fair value using the monte carlo valuation model. there are several management assumptions required to determine the inputs into the black-scholes model and monte carlo valuation model. our volatility and expected term assumptions used in the black-scholes model can significantly affect the fair value of stock options and sars. the monte carlo valuation model also utilizes multiple assumptions, including volatility, to determine the fair value of the award. changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of share-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements. the extent of the impact will depend, in part, on the extent of awards in any given year.
market risk in addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risks. market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term debt. we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities. a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. as fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures. we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions.
in december 2016, the operating partnership entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan b facility. these interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and have a notional value of $500 million and mature on november 30, 2021. the weighted average fixed rate paid is 1.825%, and the variable rate received resets monthly to the one-month libor subject to a minimum rate of 0.75%. in january 2017, the operating partnership entered into additional interest rate swap agreements through november 2021 with a total $700 million notional amount to pay a fixed rate of 1.964% and receive the 1-month libor rate in order to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan b facility. the company does not currently have any master netting arrangements related to its derivative contracts. see note 11 for additional information.
as of december 31, 2016, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 32% of our total borrowings after giving effect to the $500 million notional amount operating partnership interest rate swaps discussed above. assuming a 100 basis-point increase in libor (in the case of the mgp term loan b facility, over the 0.75% floor specified in the operating partnership credit facility and after giving effect to the $500 million notional amount operating partnership interest rate swaps discussed above), our annual interest cost would increase by $23 million based on gross amounts outstanding at december 31, 2016. assuming a 100 basis-point increase in hibor for the mgm china credit facility, our annual interest cost would increase by $19 million based on amounts outstanding at december 31, 2016. the following table provides additional information about our gross long-term debt subject to changes in interest rates excluding the effect of the operating partnership interest rate swaps discussed above:

in addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt, we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, mainly related to mgm china and to our operations at mgm macau and the development of mgm cotai. while recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant, potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the united states, china, macau or hong kong could cause variability in these exchange rates. we cannot assure you that the hong kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the u.s. dollar or the current peg rate for the hong kong dollar will remain at the same level. the possible changes to the peg of the hong kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. as of december 31, 2016, a 1% increase in the hong kong dollar (the functional currency of mgm china) to the u.s. dollar exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our cash balance by $4 million and a 1% decrease in the exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our debt balance by $20 million.

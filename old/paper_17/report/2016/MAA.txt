item 1a. risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, we have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations. investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. if any of these risks occur, our business prospects, results of operations or financial condition could suffer, the market price of our capital stock and the trading price of our debt securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our capital stock or debt securities.
risks related to the post properties merger we have incurred and expect to incur substantial expenses related to the merger.
we have incurred and expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the merger and integrating post properties' business, operations, networks, systems, technologies, policies and procedures with ours. there are a large number of systems that are in the process of being integrated, including property management, revenue management, resident payment, credit screening, lease administration, website content management, purchasing, accounting, payroll, fixed assets and financial reporting. moreover, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these integration expenses. many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. as a result, expenses associated with the merger could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of the businesses.
we may be unable to integrate post properties' businesses with ours successfully or realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the merger or do so within the anticipated time frame.
because post properties was a public company, we expect to benefit from the elimination of duplicative costs associated with supporting post properties' public company platform and the leveraging of our technology and systems. these savings are expected to be realized upon full integration, which is expected to occur during the next 12 months. however, we are required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of post properties with our business practices and operations. potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following:
•   the inability to successfully combine the businesses of maa and post properties in a manner that permits the combined corporation to achieve the cost savings anticipated to result from the merger, which would result in the anticipated benefits of the merger not being realized in the timeframe currently anticipated or at all;
•   the complexities associated with managing the combined businesses out of several different locations and integrating personnel from the combined corporation;
•   the additional complexities of combining two companies with different histories, cultures, regulatory restrictions, markets and customer bases;
•   potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays in completing integration or regulatory conditions associated with the merger; and
•   performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management's attention caused by completing the merger and integrating the combined corporation's operations.
for all these reasons, you should be aware that it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of the combined corporation's management, the disruption of the combined corporation's ongoing business or inconsistencies in the combined corporation's operations, services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the ability of the combined corporation to maintain relationships with tenants, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger, or could otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined corporation.
we may be unable to retain key employees as a result of the merger the success of the combined corporation after the mergers will depend in part upon its ability to retain key maa employees, including those from post properties. key employees of the combined corporation may depart because of, among other things, issues relating to the combination of two companies, and uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to
13
remain long term with the combined corporation. accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain key employees to the same extent as in the past.
the mergers will result in changes to the board of directors and management of the combined corporation that may affect the strategy of the combined corporation as compared to that of maa and post properties independently.
the composition of maa's board of directors changed as a result of the merger. maa's board of directors now consists of thirteen members, including all ten directors from maa's board of directors prior to the merger and three directors who were members of the post properties' board of directors prior to the merger.  this new composition of the board of directors of maa may affect our business strategy and operating decisions going forward.
our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage the expansion of its operations following the merger.
we have expanded our operations as a result of the merger and intend to continue to expand our operations through additional acquisitions and development of properties, some of which may involve complex challenges. our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage the integration of post properties' operations and our expansion opportunities, each of which may pose substantial challenges for us to integrate new operations into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, and upon our ability to successfully monitor our operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality, and to maintain other necessary internal controls. there is no assurance that our expansion or acquisition and development opportunities will be successful, or that we will realize any operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits from any future acquisitions we may complete.
our joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on our joint venture partner's financial condition and disputes between us and our joint venture partner.
post properties had a joint venture investment that now constitutes a portion of our assets as a result of the merger. in addition, we may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. these joint venture investments involve risks not present with a property wholly owned by us, including that: (i) one or more joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund a share of required capital contributions and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses; (ii) one or more joint venture partners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, creating a conflict of interest; or (iii) disputes between us and one or more of our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our operating expenses of and divert management time and attention away from our business.
the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could cause unanticipated disruption to our operations or unanticipated costs and liabilities to us, which could in turn adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and limit our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.
we have a significant amount of indebtedness and may need to incur more in the future.
we have substantial indebtedness following completion of the merger. in addition, in connection with executing our business strategies following the merger, we expect to continue to evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional properties and making strategic investments, and we may elect to finance these endeavors by incurring additional indebtedness. the amount of such indebtedness could have material adverse consequences for us, including:
•   reducing our credit ratings and thereby raising its borrowing costs;
•   hindering our ability to adjust to changing market, industry or economic conditions;
•   limiting our ability to access the capital markets to refinance maturing debt or to fund acquisitions or emerging businesses;
•   limiting the amount of free cash flow available for future operations, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases or other uses;
•   making us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns, including interest rate increases; and
•   placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors.
moreover, to respond to competitive challenges, we may be required to raise substantial additional capital to execute our business strategy. our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. if we are able to obtain additional
14
financing, our credit ratings could be further adversely affected, which could further raise our borrowing costs and further limit our future access to capital and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.
risks related to our real estate investments and our operations developments such as another economic downturn, instability in the banking sector or a negative impact on economic growth resulting from current or future legislation or government initiatives may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
the industry in which we operate may be adversely affected by national and international economic conditions. although the u.s. real estate market has recently improved, certain international markets are experiencing increased levels of volatility due to a combination of factors, including, among others, political instability from ongoing geopolitical conflicts, high unemployment rates, fluctuating oil and gas prices and fiscal deficits, and these factors could contribute to another economic downturn in the u.s. if the u.s. experience another downturn in the economy, instability in the banking sector or a negative impact on economic growth resulting from changes in legislation, government tax increases, debt policy or spending restrictions, we may experience adverse effects on our occupancy levels, our rental revenues and the value of our properties, any of which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.
other economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following:
•   local conditions, such as an oversupply of apartments or other housing available for rent, or a reduction in demand for apartments in the area;
•   low mortgage interest rates and home pricing, making alternative housing more affordable;
•   government or builder incentives which enable home buyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing options more attractive; and
•   regional economic downturns which affect one or more of our geographical markets.
failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make payments on our debt and to pay distributions to shareholders and unitholders.
our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions depends on our ability to generate cash flow in excess of operating costs and capital expenditure requirements and/or to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing. funds from operations and the value of our apartment communities may be insufficient because of factors that are beyond our control. such events or conditions could include:
•   competition from other apartment communities;
•   overbuilding of new apartments or oversupply of available apartments in our markets, which might adversely affect occupancy or rental rates and/or require rent concessions in order to lease apartments;
•   conversion of condominiums and single family houses to rental use or the increase in the number condominiums and single family homes available for sale;
•   weakness in the overall economy which lowers job growth and the associated demand for apartment housing;
•   increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes, utilities and insurance premiums) due to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset by increased rental rates;
•   inability to initially, or subsequently after lease terminations, rent apartments on favorable economic terms;
•   failure of development communities to be completed, if at all, within budget and on a timely basis or to lease up as anticipated;
•   changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance;
•   changes in laws including, but not limited to, tax laws and housing laws including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing;
•   withdrawal of government support of apartment financing through its financial backing of the federal national mortgage association, or the federal home loan mortgage corporation;
•   an uninsured loss, including those resulting from a catastrophic storm, earthquake, or act of terrorism;
•   changes in interest rate levels and the availability of financing, borrower credit standards, and down-payment requirements which could lead renters to purchase homes (if interest rates decrease and home loans are more readily available) or increase our acquisition and operating costs (if interest rates increase and financing is less readily available); and
•   the relative illiquidity of real estate investments.
15
at times, we have relied on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program, including our existing property developments. while we have sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings, if necessary, any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to make payments on our debt and to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate. any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or the trading price of our debt securities.
we are dependent on a concentration of our investments in a single asset class, making our results of operations more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in the sector or other economic factors.
as of december 31, 2016, substantially all of our investments are concentrated in the multifamily sector. as a result, we will be subject to risks inherent in investments in a single type of property. a downturn or slowdown in the demand for multifamily housing may have more pronounced effects on our results of operations or on the value of our assets than if we had diversified our investments into more than one asset class.
our operations are concentrated in the southeast and southwest regions of the united states; we are subject to general economic conditions in the regions in which we operate.
as of december 31, 2016, approximately 39.7% of our portfolio is located in our top five markets: atlanta, georgia; dallas, texas; austin, texas; charlotte, north carolina; and tampa, florida. in addition, our overall operations are concentrated in the southeast and southwest regions of the united states. our performance could be adversely affected by economic conditions in, and other factors relating to, these geographic areas, including supply and demand for apartments in these areas, zoning and other regulatory conditions and competition from other communities and alternative forms of housing. in particular our performance is disproportionately influenced by job growth and unemployment. to the extent the aforementioned general economic conditions, job growth and unemployment in any of these markets deteriorate or any of these areas experiences natural disasters, the value of the portfolio, our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt could be materially adversely affected.
failure to succeed in new markets or sectors may have adverse consequences on our performance.
we may make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise. our historical experience in our existing markets does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets, should we choose to enter them. we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets, including an inability to accurately evaluate local market conditions, to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities, to hire and retain key personnel, and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures. in addition, we may abandon opportunities to enter new markets that we have begun to explore for any reason and may, as a result, fail to recover expenses already incurred.
substantial competition among apartment communities and real estate companies may adversely affect our rental revenues and development and acquisition opportunities.
there are numerous other apartment communities and real estate companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources than we have, within the market area of each of our communities that compete with us for residents and development and acquisition opportunities. the number of competitive apartment communities and real estate companies in these areas could have a material effect on (1) our ability to rent our apartments and the rents charged, and (2) development and acquisition opportunities. the activities of these competitors could cause us to pay a higher price for a new property than we otherwise would have paid or may prevent us from purchasing a desired property at all, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt.
actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets.
actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. in addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the u.s. economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
16
breaches of our privacy or information security systems through cyber-attacks, cyber-intrusions or otherwise, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or reputation.
we face risks associated with security breaches or disruptions, which could result from, among other incidents, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses or employee error or malfeasance. the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber-terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. the protection of customer and employee data and our network systems is critically important to us. our business requires us and our service providers (including service providers engaged in providing web hosting, property management, leasing, accounting and/or payroll software/services) to use and store personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, which may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. we also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business.
we devote significant resources to protect our customer and employee data and our network systems. however, the security measures put in place by us and our service providers cannot provide absolute security and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a data security incident in the future, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive data stored on our systems, that such access will not, whether temporarily or permanently, impact, interfere with or interrupt our operations, or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner. our information technology infrastructure could be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularity, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data or accounts. even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. accordingly, we and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us and our service providers to entirely mitigate this risk. further, in the future, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
any privacy and information incident could compromise our network systems, and the information stored by us could be accessed, misused, publicly disclosed, corrupted, lost, or stolen resulting in fraud or other harm. moreover, if a data security incident or breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information, we could be materially damaged and we may be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation, possible liability and remediation costs which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or reputation and adversely affect investor confidence.
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies.
we have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:
•   we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;
•   even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the acquisition;
•   even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after incurring certain acquisition-related costs;
•   we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are subsequently unable to complete;
•   when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability;
•   we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability; and
•   we may acquire properties that are subject to liabilities or that have problems relating to environmental condition, state of title, physical condition or compliance with zoning laws, building codes or other legal requirements and in each case, our acquisition may be without any, or with only limited, recourse with respect to unknown liabilities or conditions and we may be obligated to pay substantial sums to settle or cure it, which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results.
17
we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility.
we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities:
•   a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales. in addition, if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis. intermediary agents of section 1031 exchange transactions typically handle large sums of money in trusts. misappropriation of funds by one of these agents could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. additionally, misappropriation of funds could result in the disposal of the property not qualifying for a tax deferred basis and adversely affect our financial condition. it is also possible the qualification of a transaction as a section 1031 exchange could be successfully challenged and determined to be currently taxable. in such case, our taxable income and earnings and profits would increase, which could increase the dividend income to our shareholders by reducing any return of capital they received. in some circumstances, we may be required to pay additional dividends or, in lieu of additional dividends, corporate income tax, possibly including interest and penalties. as a result, we may be required to borrow funds in order to pay additional dividends or taxes and the payment of such taxes could cause us to have less cash available to distribute to our shareholders. in addition, if a section 1031 exchange were later to be determined to be taxable, we may be required to amend our tax returns for the applicable year in question, including any information reports we sent our shareholders; and
•   federal tax laws applicable to reits limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable.
environmental problems are possible and can be costly.
under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances in, on, around or under such property. such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. the presence of, or failure to remediate properly, hazardous, toxic substances or petroleum product releases may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using the property as collateral. persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility, whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person. certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials into the air, and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials and other hazardous or toxic substances. federal and state laws also regulate the operation and subsequent removal of certain underground storage tanks. in connection with the current or former ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management, development or control of real property, we may be considered an owner or operator of such communities or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore, may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other costs, including governmental fines, and claims for injuries to persons and property.
our current policy is to obtain a phase i environmental study on each property we seek to acquire, which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling, and to proceed accordingly. we cannot assure you, however, that the phase i environmental studies or other environmental studies undertaken with respect to any of our current or future communities will reveal:
•   all or the full extent of potential environmental liabilities;
•   that any prior owner or operator of a property did not create any material environmental condition unknown to us;
18
•   that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of such communities; or
•   that environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt.
certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period. a transfer of the property does not relieve an owner of such liability. thus, we may have liability with respect to communities previously sold by our predecessors or by us.
there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate. some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements separately. we have obtained a separate pollution insurance policy that covers mold-related claims and have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our communities as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold. to the extent not covered by our pollution policy, the presence of mold could expose us to liability from residents and others if property damage, health concerns, or allegations thereof, arise.
losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage, which may negatively impact our results of operations and reduce the value of our properties.
we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for communities we acquire in the future. some losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from floods, hurricanes or earthquakes, are subject to limitations, and thus may be uninsured. we exercise our discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance, with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms. if we suffer a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment. inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed. any losses we experience that are not fully covered by our insurance may negatively impact our results of operations and may reduce the value of our properties.
increasing real estate taxes, utilities and insurance costs may negatively impact operating results.
as a result of our substantial real estate holdings, the cost of real estate taxes, utilities, and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense. real estate taxes, utilities costs and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, which can be widely outside of our control. if the costs associated with real estate taxes, utilities and insurance should rise, without being offset by a corresponding increase in rental rates, our results of operations could be negatively impacted, and our ability to pay our dividends and distributions and senior debt could be affected.
compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost.
the americans with disabilities act, the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal, state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants. these laws may require us to modify our existing communities. these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs. legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons. we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws, which may be substantial.
development and construction risks could impact our profitability.
as of december 31, 2016, we had nine development communities under construction totaling 2,816 units. we had completed 700 units for these development projects as of december 31, 2016.  we may make further investments in development communities as the opportunities arise and may do so through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks:
•   we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay
19
initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations;
•   we may be unable to obtain financing for development activities under favorable terms, which could cause a delay in construction resulting in increased costs, decreases in revenue, and potentially cause us to abandon the opportunity;
•   yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents than pro forma;
•   bankruptcy of developers in our development projects could impose delays and costs on us with respect to the development of our communities and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations;
•   we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities;
•   we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs;
•   occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community;
•   when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defects that are uninsured or exceed the limit of our insurance; and
•   our failure to successfully enter into a joint venture agreement may prohibit an otherwise advantageous investment if we cannot raise the money through other means.
we may be adversely affected by new federal laws and regulations.
the trump administration and congress have enacted, or called for consideration of, proposals relating to a variety of issues, including with respect to financial regulation reform, tax reform, infrastructure spending, climate change, executive compensation and others. we believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material. at this time, we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us.
federal rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the most recent economic recession. these initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses. the federal legislative response in this area culminated in the enactment on july 21, 2010 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, or the dodd-frank act. many of the provisions of the dodd-frank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and continue to require rulemaking by regulatory authorities; thus, the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time. the dodd-frank act, including rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are proposed or pending in the united states congress, including the repeal of or additional amendments to the dodd-frank act, may limit our revenues, impose fees or taxes on us, and/or intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable.
changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular, including certain provisions of the dodd-frank act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the possibility of repeal or amendments to the dodd-frank act, have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the u.s. public markets. because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure, our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies. we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards, and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities.
short-term leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents.
our apartment leases are generally for a term of one year or less. as these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms.
20
risks related to our indebtedness and financing activities our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
as of december 31, 2016, the amount of our total debt was approximately $4.50 billion. we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with, among other things, our acquisition, development and operating activities.
the degree of our leverage creates significant risks, including the following:
•   we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our funds from operations to servicing our debt and our cash flow may be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest;
•   debt service obligations will reduce funds available for distribution to our shareholders and funds available for acquisitions, development and redevelopment;
•   we may be more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns than our competitors that have less debt;
•   we may be limited in our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions;
•   we may default on our indebtedness, which could result in acceleration of those obligations, assignment of rents and leases and loss of properties to foreclosure; and
•   if one of our subsidiaries defaults, it could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration provision under other indebtedness, which could cause an immediate default or would could allow the lenders to declare all funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable.
if any one of these events were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we may be unable to renew, repay or refinance our outstanding debt which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, the risk that either secured or unsecured indebtedness, will not be able to be renewed, repaid or refinanced when due or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness. if we were unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our communities on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses to us. such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt. furthermore, if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property, appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies, all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value. foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code.
rising interest rates would increase the cost of our variable rate debt.
we have incurred and expect in the future to incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. accordingly, increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead holders of our shares of common stock to demand a higher yield on their shares from distributions by us, which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock.
additionally, on december 14, 2016, the federal reserve reached a decision to raise the federal funds rate by 0.25 points with additional gradual increases anticipated to occur over the next year, subject to ongoing economic uncertainty. this increase in the federal funds rate and any future increases due to other key economic indicators, such as the unemployment rate or inflation, may cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. any continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we may incur additional debt in the future, which may adversely impact our financial condition.
we currently fund the acquisition and development of multifamily apartment communities partially through borrowings (including our revolving credit facility) as well as from other sources such as sales of communities which no longer meet our investment criteria. our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that
21
we may incur, and we may issue more debt in the future. accordingly, subject to limitations on indebtedness set forth in various loan agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes, we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt and in an increased risk of default on our obligations.
the restrictive terms of certain of our indebtedness may cause acceleration of debt payments.
at december 31, 2016, we had outstanding borrowings of approximately $4.50 billion. our indebtedness contains financial covenants as to interest coverage ratios, maximum secured debt, maintenance of unencumbered asset value, and total debt to gross assets and cross default provisions with other material debt, among others. in the event that an event of default occurs, our lenders may declare borrowings under the respective loan agreements to be due and payable immediately, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt.
failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations.
from time-to-time, we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements. these agreements involve risks, such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable. hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt.
a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we have a significant amount of debt outstanding. we are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from each of the three ratings agencies based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness. these ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, we could be required to pay additional interest and fees on our outstanding borrowings. in addition, a downgrade may adversely impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and otherwise limit our access to capital, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition.
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities, development and capital expenditures, costs of operations and potential acquisitions. we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements. if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated. accordingly, we could become more leveraged, resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in our debt service requirements, both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future. if we issue additional equity securities to obtain additional financing, the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted.
risks related to maa's organization and ownership of its stock maa's ownership limit restricts the transferability of its capital stock.
maa's charter limits ownership of its capital stock by any single shareholder to 9.9% of the value of all outstanding shares of its capital stock, both common and preferred, unless approved by its board of directors. the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in it losing reit status. this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of its shares or in five or fewer persons, applying certain broad attribution rules of the code, owning 50% or more of its shares. if you acquire shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits, maa:
•   will consider the transfer to be null and void;
•   will not reflect the transaction on its books;
22
•   may institute legal action to enjoin the transaction;
•   will not pay dividends or other distributions with respect to those shares;
•   will not recognize any voting rights for those shares;
•   will consider the shares held in trust for its benefit; and
•   will either direct you to sell the shares and turn over any profit to maa, or maa will redeem the shares. if maa redeems the shares, you will be paid a price equal to the lesser of:
◦   the principal price paid for the shares by the holder,
◦   a price per share equal to the market price (as determined in the manner set forth in its charter) of the applicable capital stock,
◦   the market price (as so determined) on the date such holder would, but for the restrictions on transfers set forth in its charter, be deemed to have acquired ownership of the shares and
◦   the maximum price allowed under tennessee greenmail act (such price being the average of the highest and lowest closing market price for the shares during the 30 trading days preceding the purchase of such shares or, if the holder of such shares has commenced a tender offer or has announced an intention to seek control of maa, during the 30 trading days preceding the commencement of such tender offer or the making of such announcement).
the redemption price may be paid, at maa's option, by delivering one common unit (subject to adjustment from time to time in the event of, among other things, stock splits, stock dividends, or recapitalizations affecting its common stock or certain mergers, consolidations or asset transfers by maa) issued by the operating partnership for each excess share being redeemed.
if you acquire shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above:
•   you may lose your power to dispose of the shares;
•   you may not recognize profit from the sale of such shares if the market price of the shares increases; and
•   you may be required to recognize a loss from the sale of such shares if the market price decreases.
future offerings of debt or equity securities, which may rank senior to our common stock, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
if we decide to issue additional debt securities in the future, which would rank senior to our common stock, it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. additionally, any equity securities or convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. we and, indirectly, our shareholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of its future offerings. thus, holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings.
the form, timing and/or amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations though our board of directors has a history of declaring dividends in advance of the quarter they are paid, the form, timing and/or amount of dividend distributions will be declared, and standing practice changed, at the discretion of the board of directors. the form, timing and/or amount of dividend distributions will depend on actual cash from operations, our financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant. our board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time.
provisions of maa's charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of maa.
ownership limit the 9.9% ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of maa by a third party without the consent of our board of directors.
23
preferred stock maa's charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 868,000 of which have been designated as maa series i preferred stock. in addition to the maa series i preferred stock, the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any other series of preferred shares issued. the issuance of preferred stock, including the maa series i preferred stock, could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of maa, even if a change in control were in maa shareholders' best interests. as of december 31, 2016, approximately 868,000 shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding.
tennessee anti-takeover statutes as a tennessee corporation, maa is subject to various legislative acts, which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions. these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire maa and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if maa's acquisition would be in maa shareholders' best interests.
market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maa's common stock.
the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares, as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates. if market interest rates increase, prospective purchasers of maa's shares may expect a higher annual distribution rate. higher interest rates would not, however, result in more funds for maa to distribute and, in fact, would likely increase maa's borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution. this could cause the market price of maa's common stock to go down. in addition, although maa's common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange, or nyse, the daily trading volume of maa's common stock may be lower than the trading volume for other industries. as a result, maa's investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of maa's common stock.
changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market's expectations with regard to our results of operations and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of maa's common stock.
we believe that the market value of a reit's equity securities is based primarily upon the market's perception of the reit's growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions, and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets. for that reason, maa's common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share. to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of maa's common stock. in addition, we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay distributions to maa's shareholders. our failure to meet the market's expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of maa's stock.
the stock markets, including nyse, on which maa lists its common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of maa's common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in maa's common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. among the market conditions that may affect the market price of maa's publicly traded securities are the following:
•   our financial condition and operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;
•   actual or anticipated differences in our quarterly and annual operating results;
•   changes in our revenues or earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;
•   publication of research reports about us or our industry by securities analysts;
•   additions and departures of key personnel;
•   inability to access the capital markets;
•   strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, dispositions, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;
•   the issuance of additional shares of maa's common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, including under maa's at-the-market offering programs;
•   the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to ours;
•   the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies);
24
•   an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for maa's common stock;
•   the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry;
•   speculation in the press or investment community;
•   actions by institutional shareholders or hedge funds;
•   changes in accounting principles;
•   terrorist acts; and
•   general market conditions, including factors unrelated to our performance.
in the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources.
risks related to the operating partnership's organization and ownership of op units the operating partnership's existing unitholders have limited approval rights, which may prevent the operating partnership's sole general partner, maa, from completing a change of control transaction that may be in the best interests of all unitholders and of all the shareholders of maa.
maa may not engage in a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership, dissolve the operating partnership or, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, take any action that would result in any unitholder realizing taxable gain, without the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding op units held by holders other than maa or its affiliates, or class a op units. the right of the holders of our class a op units to vote on these transactions could limit maa's ability to complete a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interest of all of our unitholders and all shareholders of maa.
in certain circumstances, certain of the operating partnership's unitholders must approve the operating partnership's sale of certain properties contributed by the unitholders.
in certain circumstances as detailed in the partnership agreement of the operating partnership, the operating partnership may not sell or otherwise transfer certain properties unless a specified percentage of the limited partners who were partners in the limited partnership holding such properties at the time of its acquisition by us approves such sale or transfer. the exercise of these approval rights by the operating partnership's unitholders could delay or prevent the operating partnership from completing a transaction that may be in the best interest of all of the operating partnership's unitholders and all shareholders of maa.
maa, its officers and directors have substantial influence over the operating partnership's affairs.
maa, as the operating partnership's sole general partner and acting through its officers and directors, has a substantial influence on the operating partnership's affairs. maa, its officers and directors could exercise their influence in a manner that is not in the best interest of the operating partnership's unitholders. also, maa owns approximately 96.4% of the op units and as such, will have substantial influence on the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to the operating partnership's unitholders for approval.
market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maa's common stock, which would affect the redemption price of the op units.
the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares, as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates. if market interest rates increase, prospective purchasers of maa's common stock may expect a higher annual distribution rate. higher interest rates would not, however, result in more funds for maa to distribute and, in fact, would likely increase maa's borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution. this could cause the market price of maa's common stock to go down, which would reduce the price received upon redemption of any op units, or if maa so elects, the value of maa's common stock received in lieu of cash upon redemption of such op units. in addition, although maa's common stock is listed on the nyse, the daily trading volume of maa's shares may be lower than the trading volume for companies in other industries. as a result, maa's investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of the shares.
25
insufficient cash flow from operations or a decline in the market price of maa's common stock may reduce the amount of cash available to the operating partnership to meet its obligations.
the operating partnership is subject to the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to service its debt and to pay distributions to its unitholders, which may cause maa to not have the funds to pay distributions to its shareholders. maa's failure to meet the market's expectations with regard to future results of operations and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of its shares and thus potentially reduce maa's ability to contribute funds from issuances down to the operating partnership, resulting in a lower level of cash available for investment or to service our debt or to make distributions to the operating partnership's unitholders.
risks related to tax laws failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders.
if maa fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, maa will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax) without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits. in addition, unless maa is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, maa would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it loses its qualification. the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to maa's shareholders. maa's failure to qualify as a reit also could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital, and would adversely affect the value of maa's stock.
maa believes that it is organized and qualified as a reit, and maa intends to operate in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify as a reit. maa cannot assure you, however, that it is qualified or will remain qualified as a reit. this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within maa's control. in addition, future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of qualification as a reit.
even if maa qualifies as a reit, maa will be subject to various federal, state and local taxes, including property taxes and income taxes on taxable income that maa does not timely distribute to its shareholders. in addition, maa may hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly through its taxable reit subsidiaries, or trss, and those trss will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on their taxable incomes without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits.
furthermore, we have a subsidiary that has elected to be treated as a reit, and if our subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit, it is possible that we also would fail to qualify as a reit unless we (or the subsidiary reit) could qualify for certain relief provisions. the qualification of our subsidiary reit as a reit will depend on satisfaction, on an annual or quarterly basis, of numerous requirements set forth in highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. a determination as to whether such requirements are satisfied involves various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. the fact that we hold substantially all of our assets through our operating partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements for us. no assurance can be given that our subsidiary reit will qualify as a reit for any particular year.
if colonial or post properties' failed to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we would incur adverse tax consequences and our consolidated results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
prior to their respective mergers with maa, each of colonial and post properties operated in a manner intended to allow it to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. if either colonial or post properties (each, a "merged reit") is determined to have lost its reit status at any time prior to its merger with maa, maa would be subject to serious adverse tax consequences, including:
26
•   maa would be required to pay u.s. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the taxable income of such merged reit without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction for the taxable years that the merged reit did not qualify as a reit and for which the statute of limitations period remains open; and
•   maa would be required to pay any federal alternative minimum tax liability of the merged reit and any applicable state and local tax liability, in each case, for all taxable years that remain open under the applicable statute of limitations periods.
maa is liable for any tax liability of a merged reit with respect to any periods prior to the merger of such merged reit with maa. if a merged reit failed to qualify as a reit, then in the event of a taxable disposition by maa of an asset previously held by the merged reit during a specified period of up to 10 years following the merger of the merged reit with maa, maa will be subject to corporate income tax with respect to any built-in gain inherent in such asset as of the date of such merger. in addition, unless an applicable statutory relief provision applies, if a merged reit failed to qualify as a reit for a taxable year, then the merged reit would not have been entitled to re-elect to be taxed as a reit until the fifth taxable year following the year during which it was disqualified. furthermore, if both maa and a merged reit were "investment companies" under the "investment company" rules set forth in section 368 of the code at the time of the merger of maa and such merged reit, the failure of maa or such merged reit to have qualified as a reit at the time of their merger could result in such merger being treated as taxable for federal income tax purposes. as a result of all these factors, the failure by a merged reit to have qualified as a reit could jeopardize maa's qualification as a reit and require the operating partnership to provide material amounts of cash to maa to satisfy maa's additional tax liabilities and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on maa's financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects and on maa's ability to make payments on its indebtedness or distributions to its shareholders.
the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
we believe that the operating partnership qualifies, and has so qualified since its formation, as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. no assurance can be provided, however, that the internal revenue service, or irs, will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates. in addition, the treatment of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause maa to fail to qualify as a reit. see "failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders" above.
certain dispositions of property by us may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a 100% penalty tax on gain attributable to the disposition.
any gain resulting from a transfer of property that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated for federal income tax purposes as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property would be considered prohibited transactions. whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. as such, the irs may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes. a safe harbor to the characterization of the disposition of property as a prohibited transaction and the resulting imposition of the 100% tax is available; however, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with such safe harbor in connection with any property dispositions.
recent tax legislation impacts certain u.s. federal income tax rules applicable to reits and could adversely affect our current tax positions.
the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 (the "path act") changed certain aspects of the u.s. federal income tax rules applicable to us. the path act is the most recent example of changes to the reit rules, and additional legislative changes may occur that could adversely affect our current tax positions. the path act modifies various rules that apply to our ownership of, and business relationship with, our trss and reduces the maximum allowable value of our assets attributable to trss from 25% to 20% which could impact our ability to enter into future investments. the path act also makes multiple changes related to the foreign investment in real property tax act, expands prohibited transaction safe harbors and qualifying hedges, and repeals the preferential dividend rule for public reits previously applicable to us. lastly, the path
27
act adjusts the way we may calculate certain earnings and profits calculations to avoid double taxation at the stockholder level, and expands the types of qualifying assets and income for purposes of the reit requirements. the provisions enacted by the path act could result in changes in our tax positions or investments, and future legislative changes related to those rules described above could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of both maa and the operating partnership, of which maa is the sole general partner and in which maa owned a 96.4% limited partner interest as of december 31, 2016. maa conducts all of its business through the operating partnership and the operating partnership's various subsidiaries. this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty. the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
we believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical.
acquisition of real estate assets we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with asc 805-10, business combinations, which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and furniture, fixtures and equipment, and identified intangible assets, consisting of the value of in-place leases and other contracts. in calculating the fair value of acquired tangible assets, management uses stabilized net operating income (noi) and market specific capitalization and discount rates. management analyzed historical stabilized noi to determine its estimate for forecasted noi. management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similar sized markets. although management's estimates of the fair value of acquired tangible assets have been materially accurate in the past, additional information becoming available could lead to the modification of the initial fair value calculation and purchase price allocation. subsequent adjustments made to the purchase price allocation, if any, would be made within the allocation period, which typically does not exceed one year.
impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill we account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and evaluate our goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. we evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. we periodically evaluate long-lived assets, including investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions and legal factors. if impairment indicators exist for a long-lived asset, management compares the carrying amount of the asset to an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. management estimates future cash flows by analyzing historical cash flows generated by the asset. if impairment indicators exist for goodwill, management compares the carrying amount of the asset to an estimate of the implied fair value of the asset. management calculates the fair value of the asset by dividing historical operating cash flows by a market capitalization rate. management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets. no impairment losses have been recognized during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.
cost capitalization repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized. the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred. the carrying costs related to development
44
projects, including interest, property taxes, insurance and allocated direct development salary cost during the construction period, are capitalized. management uses judgment in determining whether costs should be expensed or capitalized.
loss contingencies the outcomes of claims, disputes and legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty. we record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. we review these accruals quarterly and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. when a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, then we do not accrue the loss. however, for material loss contingencies, if the unrecorded loss (or an additional loss in excess of the accrual) is at least a reasonable possibility and material, then we disclose a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, if such reasonable estimate can be made. if we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, then that is disclosed.
the assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. among the factors that we consider in this assessment, including with respect to the matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10-k, are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if reasonably estimable), the progress of the matter, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in similar matters, the facts available to us at the time of assessment, and how we intend to respond, or have responded, to the proceeding or claim. our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress. for matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate; (ii) the proceedings are in the early stages; (iii) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties; and/or (iv) discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss, or range of loss, can be made. in such instances, we believe that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss or business impact, if any.
for more information regarding our significant accounting policies, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements, note 1.
overview of the year ended december 31, 2016
as noted earlier, on december 1, 2016, we consummated the merger and acquired all of post properties' net assets. as a result of the merger, the results of operations for 2016 include 12 months of results for maa and one month of results for post properties. our december 31, 2016 balance sheet includes the combined assets and liabilities of maa and post properties. all properties acquired from post properties have been placed in our "non-same store and other" operating segment, as the properties are recent acquisitions and have not been owned and stabilized for at least 12 months.
we experienced a decrease in income from continuing operations in 2016 despite increases in revenues outpacing increases in property operating expenses due to lower gain on sale of depreciable real estate assets and increased merger and integration costs. the increases in revenues came from a 4.9% increase in our large market same store segment, a 3.1% increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 41.7% increase in our non-same store and other segment, which was primarily a result of the merger. the increase in property operating expenses came from a 3.2% increase in our large market same store segment, a 2.0% increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 30.7% increase in our non-same store and other segment, which was primarily the result of the merger. our same store portfolio represents those communities that have been held and have been stabilized for at least 12 months. communities excluded from the same store portfolio include recent acquisitions, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities undergoing extensive renovations, and communities identified for disposition. additional information regarding the composition of operating segments is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, note 16 - segment information. the drivers of these increases are discussed below in the results of operations section.
we have grown externally during the past three years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the southeast and southwest region of the united states. apart from the merger, we acquired four apartment communities for our portfolio in 2014, seven in 2015 and five in 2016. offsetting some of this increased revenue stream were four apartment community dispositions in 2014, twenty-one in 2015, and twelve in 2016.

results of operations as a result of the merger, the results of operations for 2016 include twelve months of results for maa and one month of results for post properties. our december 31, 2016 balance sheet includes the combined assets and liabilities of maa and post properties.

the increase in property operating expenses from our large market same store group is primarily the result of increases in real estate taxes of $5.3 million, personnel expenses of $1.5 million, and utilities expenses of $1.2 million. the increase in our large market same store operating expenses was slightly offset by a decrease in insurance expense of $0.5 million. the increase in property operating expenses from our secondary market same store group is primarily a result of increases in real estate taxes of $1.3 million, personnel expenses of $0.6 million, and utilities expenses of $0.5 million. the increase in property operating expenses from our non-same store and other portfolio is primarily the result of the merger, which we classified as non-same store. see discussion of our segment classification methodology at note 16 (segment information).

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $28.4 million is primarily driven by depreciation expense of $17.4 million related to the merger. additionally, the amortization of fair market value of in-place leases began in december of 2016 totaling $4.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.
merger and integration costs merger related expenses for the acquisition of post properties were approximately $39.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. we also incurred integration related expenses of approximately $1.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. these expenses primarily consisted of legal, management salaries, and professional fees. there were no merger or integration related expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 because no merger occurred in that year and the expenses associated with our merger with colonial properties trust, or colonial, had already been incurred.
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 was approximately $129.9 million, an increase of $7.6 million from the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was due in part to decreased amortization of fair market value of debt adjustments related to debt acquired and increased interest rates towards the end of 2016. additionally, we assumed several
47
loans through the acquisition of post properties, including a secured loan with a face value of $186.0 million and two unsecured loans with face values of $150.0 million and $250.0 million.
loss on debt extinguishment loss on debt extinguishment was approximately $83,000 for the year ended december 31, 2016. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded a loss of $3.6 million. the decrease of $3.5 million was due primarily to the removal of properties from a secured tax-free debt facility for the year ended december 31, 2015. with the exception of an $83,000 gain on extinguishment, offset by a $166,000 loss for the write-off of deferred financing costs and related fees, there was no activity for the year ended december 31, 2016.
dispositions of depreciable real estate assets excluded from discontinued operations we recorded a gain on sale of depreciable assets excluded from discontinued operations of $80.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, a decrease of approximately $109.6 million from the $190.0 million gain on sale of depreciable assets recorded for the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease was primarily the result of a decline in disposition activity year over year. dispositions decreased from twenty-one multifamily properties for the year ended december 31, 2015, to twelve multifamily properties for the year ended december 31, 2016.
dispositions of non-depreciable real estate assets excluded from discontinued operations we recorded a gain on sale of non-depreciable assets excluded from discontinued operations of approximately $2.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, an increase of $2.0 million from the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase in gain on sale can be attributed to the rise in non-depreciable asset distributions year over year. dispositions increased from one property for the year ended december 31, 2015, to four properties for the year ended december 31, 2016.
preferred dividends distributed as a result of the merger, for the year ended december 31, 2016 we recorded a dividend distribution to shareholders of preferred stock of $307,000. as there were no maa series i preferred shares issued and outstanding as of the year ended december 31, 2015, we did not record a dividend distribution.
comparison of the year ended december 31, 2015 to the year ended december 31, 2014
the comparison of the year ended december 31, 2015 to the year ended december 31, 2014 shows the segment break down based on the 2015 same store portfolios. a comparison using the 2016 same store portfolio would not be comparative due to the nature of the classifications.

the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to a decrease of $19.4 million related to the amortization of the fair value of in-place leases and resident relationships acquired as a result of the merger with colonial from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of $11.7 million driven by an increase in gross real estate assets from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015.
property management expenses property management expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 were approximately $31.0 million, a decrease of $1.1 million from the year ended december 31, 2014. the majority of the decrease was related to a decrease in state franchise taxes of $2.1 million, partially offset by an increase in insurance expense of $0.6 million, an increase in payroll expense of $0.3 million, and an increase in incentive expense $0.3 million.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 was approximately $25.7 million, an increase of $4.8 million from the year ended december 31, 2014. the majority of the increase was related to increases in legal fees of $2.7 million and stock option expenses of $1.6 million.

merger and integration related expenses there were no merger or integration related expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015. for the year ended december 31, 2014, merger and integration related expenses were approximately $3.2 million and $8.4 million, respectively. these expenses related primarily to severance, legal, professional, temporary systems, staffing, and facilities costs incurred for the acquisition and integration of colonial.
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2015 was approximately $122.3 million, a decrease of $1.6 million from the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in amortization of deferred financing cost from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015 of approximately $0.9 million. also, the overall debt balance decreased from $3.5 billion to $3.4 billion, a decrease of $85.1 million. the average effective interest rate remained at 3.7% and the average years to rate maturity increased from 4.4 years to 4.8 years.
dispositions of depreciable real estate assets excluded from discontinued operations we recorded a gain on sale of depreciable assets excluded from discontinued operations of $190.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $147.3 million from the $42.6 million gain on sale of depreciable assets recorded for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily the result of increased disposition activity. dispositions increased from eight multifamily properties for the year ended december 31, 2014, to twenty-one multifamily properties for the year ended december 31, 2015.
gain from real estate joint ventures we recorded a gain from real estate joint ventures of $6.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 as opposed to no material gain or loss being recorded during the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease was primarily a result of recording a $3.4 million gain for the disposition of ansley village by mid-america multifamily fund ii, or fund ii, as well as a $2.8 million gain for the promote fee received from our fund ii partner during 2014. the promote fee was received as a result of maa achieving certain performance metrics in its management of the fund ii properties over the life of the joint venture. there were no such gains recorded during the year ended december 31, 2015.
discontinued operations we recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $5.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. we did not record a gain or loss on sale of discontinued operations during the year ended december 31, 2015, due the adoption of asu 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity, which resulted in dispositions being included in the gain on sale of depreciable real estate assets excluded from discontinued operations and is discussed further below.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31, 2015 was approximately $18.5 million, an increase of $10.2 million from the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase is consistent with the increase to overall net income and is primarily a result of the items discussed above.
net income attributable to maa primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to maa increased by approximately $184.3 million in the year ended december 31, 2015 from the year ended december 31, 2014.
funds from operations funds from operations, or ffo, a non-gaap financial measure, represents net income (computed in accordance with gaap) excluding extraordinary items, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, asset impairment, gains or losses on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis. disposition of real estate assets includes, but is not limited to, sales of discontinued operations.
50
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income, or any other gaap measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. management believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets. we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. our calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits.
core ffo, a non-gaap financial measure, represents ffo excluding certain non-cash or non-routine items such as acquisition, merger and integration expenses, mark-to-market debt adjustments and loss or gain on debt extinguishment. while our definition of core ffo is similar to others in our industry, our precise methodology for calculating core ffo may differ from that utilized by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits. core ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. management believes that core ffo is helpful in understanding our operating performance in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance.

ffo for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased by approximately $11.0 million from the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of $82.6 million, which was offset by increases in merger and integration related expenses of $40.8 million, property operating expenses, excluding depreciation, of $22.7 million, property management expenses of $3.1 million, and general and administrative expenses of $3.3 million.
51
ffo for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased by approximately $48.3 million from the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of $50.6 million and a decrease in merger and integration related expenses of $11.5 million, which were partially offset by increases of $7.3 million in property operating expenses and $4.8 million in general and administrative expenses.
core ffo for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased by approximately $51.7 million from the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of $82.6 million, which was offset by increases in property operating expenses, excluding depreciation, of $22.7 million, property management expenses of $3.1 million, and general and administrative expenses of $3.3 million.
core ffo for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased by approximately $42.9 million from the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of $50.6 million and the decrease in interest expense, excluding the mark-to-market debt adjustment, of $6.7 million, which was partially offset by the $7.3 million increase in property operating expenses and the $4.8 million in general and administrative expenses.
trends during the twelve months ended december 31, 2016, demand for apartments was strong, as it was during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015. this strength was evident on two fronts: occupancy and effective rent per unit. same store physical occupancy ended december 2016 at a 96.6% and average physical occupancy for the same store portfolio was 96.2% for the twelve months ended december 31, 2016, up 15 basis points from the twelve months ended december 31, 2015. same store average effective rent per unit continued to grow, up 4.2% in the twelve months ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2015.
an important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a diversity of markets, submarkets, product types and price points across the southeast and southwest regions of the united states. this diversity tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area. we believe that a well-balanced portfolio, including both large and select secondary markets; inner loop, suburban, and downtown/cbd locations; and various monthly rent price points will perform well in "up" cycles as well as weather "down" cycles better. as of december 31, 2016, including the impact of the merger, we were invested in approximately 39 defined msas, diversified across both large markets and secondary markets, urban and suburban submarkets, and a variety of monthly rent pricing points.
according to u.s. census bureau data, as of november 30, 2016, multifamily permitting was down over 7% as compared to november 30, 2015.  while we believe a return to historical permitting will ultimately lead to a further increase in supply, we also believe the lack of new apartments in recent years, the current downward trend of multifamily permitting, and the demand from new households will help keep supply and demand essentially in balance in most markets. also, we believe that more disciplined credit terms for residential mortgages should continue to favor rental demand at existing multifamily properties. furthermore, rental competition from single family homes has not been a major competitive factor impacting our portfolio. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2016, total move outs attributable to single family home rentals dropped to 7% of total move outs as compared to 8% of total move outs for the twelve months ended december 31, 2015. we have seen significant rental competition from single family homes in only a few of our submarkets. long term, we expect demographic trends (including the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest) will continue to support apartment rental demand for our markets.
our focus is on maintaining strong physical occupancy while increasing pricing where possible through our revenue management system. as noted above, physical occupancy ended december 2016 strong and the average for the twelve months ended december 2016 was 15 basis points above the level we achieved in the twelve months ended december 31, 2015. as we move through the remainder of the typically slower winter leasing season and into the typically stronger spring leasing season, the current level of physical occupancy puts us in a good position to capture solid pricing in the first half of 2017.
we continue to develop improved products, operating systems and procedures that we believe enable us to capture more revenues. benefits of improved practices such as monthly and intra-monthly lease expiration management and collections performance enable us to capture increased revenue. we continue to actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses. furthermore, the merger provides further opportunity to benefit from economies of scale and to combine best practices across the entire portfolio.

liquidity and capital resources our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as well as general economic and market conditions, are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources. the significant changes in cash from the year ended december 31, 2015 to the year ended december 31, 2016 due to operating, investing, and financing activities are as follows:
operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to $484.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 from $463.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. this change was a result of various items, including higher revenues, as discussed above.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased to $710.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 from $136.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the primary drivers of this change are as follows:

the increase in cash outflows during the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily resulted in cash proceeds, net of cash acquired, of $427.8 million being used to satisfy post properties' debt, at the time of the merger and included as consideration provided for the merger. the increase in cash outflows from purchases of real estate and other assets primarily resulted from the cost of the acquisition of five apartment communities during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the cost of the acquisition of seven apartment communities during the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease in proceeds from disposition of real estate assets primarily resulted from the sale of twelve apartment communities, one commercial property, and three land parcels during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the sale of twenty-one apartment communities, one commercial property, and one land parcel during the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease in cash inflows from the funding of escrow for future acquisitions resulted from the funding of one anticipated future1031(b) transactions into escrow during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the funding of two 1031(b) transactions during and corresponding return to cash from escrow for those transactions during the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase in cash outflows for development resulted from the timing of development spending during the year ended december 31, 2016.

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased to $222.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 from $316.6 million used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2015. the primary drivers of this change are as follows:

principal payments on notes payable   $(146,026                 )                         $(279,077                 )            $133,051                                                     47.7   %

the increase in cash inflows related to the net change in credit lines resulted from the increase in borrowings of $335.0 million on the keybank facility (as defined below) during 2016, which included $140.0 million used to pay off post properties' line of credit facility, compared to the net decrease of $180.1 million due to net repayments in 2015 of $105.8 million on our fannie mae secured credit facility and $91.1 million on our tax free secured property facility, which were partially offset by net increases on our keybank facility of $16.0 million. the decrease in cash inflows from proceeds from notes payable is primarily due to the fact that during 2015 we issued $400 million in unsecured bonds compared to proceeds of $300 million related to the issuance of the wells fargo term loan received in 2016. the increase in cash outflows from dividends paid on common shares primarily resulted from the increase in the dividend rate to $0.82 per share during the year ended december 31, 2016 from $0.77 per share during the year ended december 31, 2015.
equity as of december 31, 2016, maa owned 113,518,212 op units, comprising a 96.4% limited partnership interest in the operating partnership, while the remaining 4,220,403 outstanding op units were held by limited partners of the operating partnership. holders of op units (other than maa and its corporate affiliates) may require us to redeem their op units from time to time, in which case we may, at our option, pay the redemption price either in cash (in an amount per op unit equal, in general, to the average closing price of maa's common stock on the nyse over a specified period prior to the redemption date) or by delivering one share of our common stock (subject to adjustment under specified circumstances) for each op unit so redeemed. in addition, we have registered under the securities act the 4,220,403 shares of our common stock, which as of december 31, 2016, were issuable upon redemption of op units held by the operating partnership's limited partners so that those shares can be sold freely in the public markets. to the extent that additional op units are issued to limited partners of the operating partnership, we will likely register the additional shares of common stock issuable upon redemption of those op units under the securities act of 1933, as amended, so that those shares can also be sold in the public markets. if maa issues shares of common stock upon the redemption of op units in the operating partnership, sales of substantial amounts of such shares of common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for maa common stock or may impair maa's ability to raise capital through the sale of common stock or other equity securities.
in connection with the merger, we issued to the then-holders of post properties capital stock and op units approximately 38.0 million shares of maa common stock, approximately 80,000 op units, and approximately 868,000 maa series i preferred stock on december 1, 2016.

(3) swapped interest is subject to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges as described in note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the annual report on form 10-k.
(4) represents development fees.
(5) primarily comprised of a ground lease underlying one apartment community owned by the company.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2016, and 2015, we did not have any relationships, including those with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
as of december 31, 2016, we had a 35% ownership interest in the post massachusetts avenue joint venture, which consists of 269 units. our investment in this real estate joint ventures is unconsolidated and is recorded using the equity method for the joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest.
57
in addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. as such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. we do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements, note 14.
insurance we renegotiated our primary insurance programs effective july 1, 2016. we believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operation.
inflation our resident leases at the apartment communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder, and thus may enable us to seek rent increases. almost all leases are for one year or less. the short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation.
impact of recently issued accounting standards the following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements that could have a material effect on our financial statements:

asu 2015-16 , simplifying the accounting for measurement -period adjustments   this asu was issued to simplify the accounting for business combinations, specifically as it relates to measurement-period adjustments. acquiring entities in a business combination must recognize measurement-period adjustments in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. also, asu 2015-16 requires entities to present separately on the face of the income statement (or disclose in the notes to the financial statements) the portion of the amount recorded in the current period earnings, by line item, that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.                                      this asu is effective for annual periods ending after december 15, 2015. we adopted this asu effective january 1, 2016.   adoption of this asu did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements; however, as noted in note 2, business combinations, we will continue to monitor these adjustments related to the post merger as the measurement period remains open for twelve months following the 12/1/16 merger date.

asu 2014-16 - derivatives and hedging (topic 815), determining whether the host contract in a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share is more akin to debt or to equity   this asu clarifies how u.s. gaap should be applied in determining whether the nature of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share is more akin to debt or equity and in evaluating whether the economic characteristics and risks of an embedded feature are "clearly and closely related" to its host contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   this asu is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after 15 december 2015. we adopted this asu effective january 1, 2016.                                                                                                                upon initial adoption on january 1, 2016, this asu did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. however, as a result of the issuance of the maa series i preferred stock resulting from the merger on december 1, 2016, we identified a redemption feature embedded in this preferred stock and determined that we were required to bifurcate the value associated with this feature from its host instrument, the preferred shares, and account for it as a freestanding derivative on the balance sheet at fair value as a result of the call option in accordance with this guidance in asc 815. (see note 7 and 8 for details and referenced impact to our consolidated financial statements and disclosures).
asu 2014-15, disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern                                                                                           this asu requires an entity's management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. if substantial doubt exists, the entity must disclose the principal conditions or events that raised the substantial doubt, management's evaluation of the significance of these conditions, and management's plan for alleviating the substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.   this asu is effective for annual periods ending after december 15, 2016. we adopted this guidance on december 31, 2016.                                                                                                                                                                we adopted this guidance on december 31, 2016, and the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact to the consolidated financial statements or material impact on our disclosures.
asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers                                                                                                                                          this asu establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services as outlined in a five-step model whereby revenue is recognized as performance obligations within a contract are satisfied. income from lease contracts is specifically excluded from this asu.                                                                                                                                                                                     this asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, as a result of a deferral of the effective date arising from the issuance of asu 2015-14, revenue from contracts with customers - deferral of the effective date. early adoption is permitted.   the amendments may be applied using the full retrospective transition method resulting in adjustments to each prior period presented as of the date of initial application or by using the modified retrospective transition method with a cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. we currently expect to adopt asu 2014-09 effective january 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach. we have identified our revenue streams and are in the process of evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements and internal accounting processes; however, the majority of our revenue is derived from real estate lease contracts.
asu 2016-02, leases                                                                                                                                                                         this asu amends existing accounting standards for lease accounting and establishes the principles for lease accounting for both the lessee and lessor. the amendment requires an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases with terms of more than 12 months. recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease. the amendment also requires certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements.                                                                                   this asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2018; however, early adoption is permitted.                                                                                                                                                            the standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and provides for certain practical expedients. transition will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. we are currently evaluating the impact this standard may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures upon adoption.
asu 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting                                                                                                                        this asu amends existing accounting standards for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. the new guidance will require all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. it also will allow an employer to repurchase more of an employee's shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur.                                                                                                                   this asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted.                                                                                                                                                            the standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition method, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. we are currently evaluating the impact this standard may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures upon adoption.

asu 2016-15, classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments (a consensus of the emerging issues task force)   this asu clarifies how several specific cash receipts and cash payments are to be presented and classified on the statement of cash flows, including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration made after a business combination, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of predominance principle.   this asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted.   each amendment in this standard must be applied prospectively, retrospectively, or as of the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the year of adoption, depending on the type of amendment. we expect to adopt asu 2016-15 as of january 1, 2018, and we are currently evaluating the impact this standard may have on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
asu 2016-18, statement of cash flows (topic 230):restricted cash (a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force)    this asu requires restricted cash to be presented with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and ending amounts in the statements of cash flows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      this asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted.   the update should be applied retrospectively to each period presented. we expect to adopt asu 2016-15 as of january 1, 2018. we currently report the change in restricted cash within the investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. if we were to early adopt in 2017, cash and cash equivalents reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows would increase by approximately $88.3 million and $26.1 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, to reflect the restricted cash balances. additionally, net cash used in investing activities would increase by $58.3 million in 2016 and decrease by $8 thousand in 2015.
asu 2017-01, clarifying the definition of a business (topic 805)                                                         this asu clarifies the definition of a business and provides further guidance for evaluating whether a transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of an asset or a business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    this asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted.   the update should be applied prospectively. we adopted asu 2017-01 as of january 1, 2017 and the adoption did not require any additional disclosures. we believe most of our future acquisitions of operating properties will qualify as asset acquisitions and most future transaction costs associated with these acquisitions will be capitalized.

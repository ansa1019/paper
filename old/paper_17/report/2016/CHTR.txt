item 1a.     risk factors.
risks related to the integration of the transactions if we are not able to successfully integrate our business with that of legacy twc and legacy bright house within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the transactions may not be realized fully, or at all, or
18
may take longer to realize than expected. in such circumstance, we may not perform as expected and the value of charter's class a common stock may be adversely affected.
until the closing of the transactions, legacy charter, legacy twc and legacy bright house operated independently, and there can be no assurances that their businesses can be integrated successfully. we now have significantly more systems, assets, investments, businesses, customers and employees than each company did prior to the transactions. it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key charter employees, the loss of customers, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. the process of integrating legacy twc and legacy bright house with the legacy charter operations will require significant capital expenditures and the expansion of certain operations and operating and financial systems. management will be required to devote a significant amount of time and attention to the integration process and there is a significant degree of difficulty and management involvement inherent in that process. these difficulties include:
•   integrating the companies' operations and corporate functions;
•   integrating the companies' technologies, networks and customer service platforms;
•   integrating and unifying the product offerings and services available to customers, including customer premise equipment and video user interfaces;
•   harmonizing the companies' operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes;
•   maintaining existing relationships and agreements with customers, providers, programmers and other vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, providers and vendors;
•   addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;
•   consolidating the companies' administrative and information technology infrastructure;
•   coordinating programming and marketing efforts;
•   coordinating geographically dispersed organizations;
•   integrating information, purchasing, provisioning, accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll, reporting and regulatory compliance systems;
•   completing the conversion of analog systems to all-digital for the legacy twc and legacy bright house systems; and
•   attracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquired assets.
even if the new businesses are successfully integrated, it may not be possible to realize the benefits that are expected to result from the transactions, or realize these benefits within the time frame that is expected. for example, the elimination of duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated, or the benefits from the transactions may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the businesses and increased operating costs. if the combined company fails to realize the anticipated benefits from the transactions, our liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and/or share price may be adversely affected. in addition, at times, the attention of certain members of our management and resources may be focused on the integration of the businesses and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt the business of the combined company.
if the operating results of legacy twc and/or legacy bright house are less than our expectations, or an increase in the capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain those assets as well as to keep pace with technological developments are greater than expected, we may not achieve the expected level of financial results from the transactions.
we will derive a portion of our continuing revenues and earnings per share from the operations of legacy twc and legacy bright house. therefore, any negative impact on these companies or the operating results derived from such companies could harm the combined company's operating results.
our business and the businesses of legacy twc and legacy bright house are characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new products and services. we intend to make investments in the combined business and transition toward only using two-way all-digital set-top boxes. the increase in capital expenditures necessary for the transition toward two-way set-top boxes in the business may negatively impact the expected financial results from the transactions. the combined company may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments, execute the plans to do so, or anticipate the demand of its customers for products and services requiring new technology or bandwidth. our inability to maintain, expand and upgrade our existing or combined businesses could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
the transactions were accounted for as an acquisition in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of legacy twc and legacy bright house have been recorded, as of the date of completion of the transactions, at their respective fair values and added to our assets and liabilities.
19
the excess of the purchase price over those fair values has been recorded as goodwill. to the extent the value of goodwill or intangibles becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to such impairment. such a potential impairment charge could have a material impact on our operating results.
as a result of the closing of the transactions, our businesses are subject to the conditions set forth in the fcc order and the doj consent decree and those imposed by state utility commissions and local franchise authorities, and there can be no assurance that these conditions will not have an adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations.
in connection with the transactions, the fcc order, the doj consent decree, and the approvals from state utility commissions and local franchise authorities incorporated numerous commitments and voluntary conditions made by the parties and imposed numerous conditions on our businesses relating to the operation of our business and other matters. among other things, (i) we will not be permitted to charge usage-based prices or impose data caps and will be prohibited from charging interconnection fees for qualifying parties; (ii) we will be prohibited from entering into or enforcing any agreement with a programmer that forbids, limits or creates incentives to limit the programmer's provision of content to ovd and cannot retaliate against programmers for licensing to ovds; (iii) we will not be able to avail ourself of other distributors' most favored nation ("mfn") provisions if they are inconsistent with this prohibition; (iv) we must undertake a number of actions designed to promote diversity; (v) we must appoint an independent compliance monitor and comply with a broad array of reporting requirements; and (v) we must satisfy various other conditions relating to our internet services, including building out an additional two million locations with access to a high-speed connection of at least 60 megabits per second with at least one million of those connections in competition with another high-speed broadband provider in the market served, and implementing a reduced price high-speed internet program for low income families. these and other conditions and commitments relating to the transactions are of varying duration, ranging from three to seven years. in light of the breadth and duration of the conditions and potential changes in market conditions during the time the conditions and commitments are in effect, there can be no assurance that our compliance, and ability to comply, with the conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
risks related to our indebtedness we have a significant amount of debt and may incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business.
we have a significant amount of debt and may (subject to applicable restrictions in our debt instruments) incur additional debt in the future. as of december 31, 2016, our total principal amount of debt was approximately $60.0 billion.
our significant amount of debt could have consequences, such as:
•   impact our ability to raise additional capital at reasonable rates, or at all;
•   make us vulnerable to interest rate increases, in part because approximately 13% of our borrowings as of december 31, 2016 were, and may continue to be, subject to variable rates of interest;
•   expose us to increased interest expense to the extent we refinance existing debt with higher cost debt;
•   require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operating activities to make payments on our debt, reducing our funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate expenses;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the cable and telecommunications industries, and the economy at large;
•   place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt; and
•   adversely affect our relationship with customers and suppliers.
if current debt amounts increase, our business results are lower than expected, or credit rating agencies downgrade our debt limiting our access to investment grade markets, the related risks that we now face will intensify.
the agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity.
our credit facilities and the indentures governing our debt contain a number of significant covenants that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our liquidity, and our results of operations. these covenants restrict, among other things, our and our subsidiaries' ability to:
•   incur additional debt;
•   repurchase or redeem equity interests and debt;
•   issue equity;
20
•   make certain investments or acquisitions;
•   pay dividends or make other distributions;
•   dispose of assets or merge;
•   enter into related party transactions; and
•   grant liens and pledge assets.
additionally, the charter operating credit facilities require charter operating to comply with a maximum total leverage covenant and a maximum first lien leverage covenant. the breach of any covenants or obligations in our indentures or credit facilities, not otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. in addition, the secured lenders under our notes and the charter operating credit facilities could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity interests in our subsidiaries, and exercise other rights of secured creditors.
we depend on generating sufficient cash flow to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures, and ongoing operations.
we are dependent on our cash on hand and cash flow from operations to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures and ongoing operations. our ability to service our debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures and ongoing operations will depend on our ability to continue to generate cash flow and our access (by dividend or otherwise) to additional liquidity sources at the applicable obligor. our ability to continue to generate cash flow is dependent on many factors, including:
•   our ability to sustain and grow revenues and cash flow from operations by offering video, internet, voice, advertising and other services to residential and commercial customers, to adequately meet the customer experience demands in our markets and to maintain and grow our customer base, particularly in the face of increasingly aggressive competition, the need for innovation and the related capital expenditures;
•   the impact of competition from other market participants, including but not limited to incumbent telephone companies, direct broadcast satellite operators, wireless broadband and telephone providers, dsl providers, video provided over the internet and providers of advertising over the internet;
•   general business conditions, economic uncertainty or downturn, high unemployment levels and the level of activity in the housing sector;
•   our ability to obtain programming at reasonable prices or to raise prices to offset, in whole or in part, the effects of higher programming costs (including retransmission consents);
•   the development and deployment of new products and technologies including our cloud-based user interface, spectrum guide®;
•   the effects of governmental regulation on our business or potential business combination transactions; and
•   any events that disrupt our networks, information systems or properties and impair our operating activities and negatively impact our reputation.
some of these factors are beyond our control. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or we are unable to access additional liquidity sources, we may not be able to service and repay our debt, operate our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs.
restrictions in our subsidiaries' debt instruments and under applicable law limit their ability to provide funds to us and our subsidiaries that are debt issuers.
our primary assets are our equity interests in our subsidiaries. our operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and are not obligated to make funds available to their debt issuer holding companies for payments on our notes or other obligations in the form of loans, distributions, or otherwise. charter operating's ability to make distributions to charter or cco holdings, our other primary debt issuers other than twc, llc and twce, to service debt obligations is subject to its compliance with the terms of its credit facilities, and restrictions under applicable law. twc, llc's and twce's ability to make distributions to charter, cco holdings or charter operating to service debt obligations is subject to restrictions under applicable law. see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data." under the delaware limited liability company act (the "act"), our subsidiaries may only make distributions if the relevant entity has "surplus" as defined in the act. under fraudulent transfer laws, our subsidiaries may not pay dividends if the relevant entity is insolvent or is rendered insolvent thereby. the measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if:
•   the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets;
21
•   the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or
•   it could not pay its debts as they became due.
we believe that our relevant subsidiaries currently have surplus and are not insolvent, however, these subsidiaries may become insolvent in the future. our direct or indirect subsidiaries include the borrowers and guarantors under the charter operating credit facilities and notes, under the cco holdings notes and under the twc, llc and twce notes. as of december 31, 2016, our total principal amount of debt was approximately $60.0 billion.
in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, or dissolution of one or more of our subsidiaries, that subsidiary's assets would first be applied to satisfy its own obligations, and following such payments, such subsidiary may not have sufficient assets remaining to make payments to its parent company as an equity holder or otherwise. in that event, the lenders under charter operating's credit facilities and notes and any other indebtedness of our subsidiaries whose interests are secured by substantially all of our operating assets, and all holders of other debt of charter operating, cco holdings, twc, llc and twce will have the right to be paid in full before us from any of our subsidiaries' assets.
some of our outstanding debt is subject to change of control provisions. we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to fulfill our obligations under our indebtedness following a change of control, which would place us in default under the applicable debt instruments.
we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to fulfill our obligations under our notes and our credit facilities following a change of control. under the indentures governing the cco holdings' notes, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, the debt issuer is required to offer to repurchase all of its outstanding notes. however, we may not have sufficient access to funds at the time of the change of control event to make the required repurchase of the applicable notes, and charter operating is limited in its ability to make distributions or other payments to any debt issuer to fund any required repurchase. in addition, a change of control under the charter operating credit facilities would result in a default under those credit facilities, which would trigger a default under the indentures governing the cco holdings' notes, the charter operating notes and the twc, llc and twce notes. because such credit facilities and notes are obligations of charter operating and its subsidiaries, the credit facilities would have to be repaid before charter operating's assets could be available to cco holdings to repurchase their notes. any failure to make or complete a change of control offer would place cco holdings in default under their notes. the failure of our subsidiaries to make a change of control offer or repay the amounts accelerated under their notes and credit facilities would place them in default under such agreements.
risks related to our business we operate in a very competitive business environment, which affects our ability to attract and retain customers and can adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.
the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and has become more so in recent years. in some instances, we compete against companies with fewer regulatory burdens, better access to financing, greater personnel resources, greater resources for marketing, greater and more favorable brand name recognition, and long-established relationships with regulatory authorities and customers. increasing consolidation in the cable industry and the repeal of certain ownership rules have provided additional benefits to certain of our competitors, either through access to financing, resources, or efficiencies of scale.
our residential video service faces competition from a number of sources, including direct broadcast satellite services, as well as other companies that deliver movies, television shows and other video programming over broadband internet connections to tvs, computers, tablets and mobile devices. our residential internet service faces competition from the phone companies' dsl, ftth and wireless broadband offerings as well as from a variety of companies that offer other forms of online services, including wireless and satellite-based broadband services. our residential voice service competes with wireless and wireline phone providers, as well as other forms of communication, such as text messaging on cellular phones, instant messaging, social networking services, video conferencing and email. competition from these companies, including intensive marketing efforts with aggressive pricing, exclusive programming and increased hd broadcasting may have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain customers.
overbuilds could also adversely affect our growth, financial condition, and results of operations, by creating or increasing competition. we are aware of traditional overbuild situations impacting certain of our markets, however, we are unable to predict the extent to which additional overbuild situations may occur.
our services may not allow us to compete effectively. competition may reduce our expected growth of future cash flows which may contribute to future impairments of our franchises and goodwill and our ability to meet cash flow requirements, including
22
debt service requirements. for additional information regarding the competition we face, see "business -competition" and "-regulation and legislation."
we face risks relating to competition for the leisure time and discretionary spending of audiences, which has intensified in part due to advances in technology and changes in consumer expectations and behavior.
in addition to the various competitive factors discussed above, we are subject to risks relating to increasing competition for the leisure time, shifting consumer needs and discretionary spending of consumers. we compete with all other sources of entertainment, news and information delivery, as well as a broad range of communications products and services. technological advancements, such as new video formats and internet streaming and downloading of programming that can be viewed on televisions, computers, smartphones and tablets, many of which have been beneficial to us, have nonetheless increased the number of entertainment and information delivery choices available to consumers and intensified the challenges posed by audience fragmentation.
newer products and services, particularly alternative methods for the distribution, sale and viewing of content will likely continue to be developed, further increasing the number of competitors that we face. the increasing number of choices available to audiences, including low-cost or free choices, could negatively impact not only consumer demand for our products and services, but also advertisers' willingness to purchase advertising from us. we compete for the sale of advertising revenue with television networks and stations, as well as other advertising platforms, such as radio, print and, increasingly, online media. our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to new technologies and changes in consumer expectations and behavior could significantly adversely affect our competitive position and our business and results of operations.
our exposure to the economic conditions of our current and potential customers, vendors and third parties could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.
we are exposed to risks associated with the economic conditions of our current and potential customers, the potential financial instability of our customers and their financial ability to purchase our products. if there were a general economic downturn, we may experience increased cancellations by our customers or unfavorable changes in the mix of products purchased, including an increase in the number of homes that replace their video service with internet-delivered and/or over-air content, which would negatively impact our ability to attract customers, increase rates and maintain or increase revenue. in addition, providing video services is an established and highly penetrated business. our ability to gain new video subscribers is dependent to a large extent on growth in occupied housing in our service areas, which is influenced by both national and local economic conditions. weak economic conditions may also have a negative impact on our advertising revenue. these events have adversely affected us in the past, and may adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition if a downturn were to occur.
in addition, we are susceptible to risks associated with the potential financial instability of the vendors and third parties on which we rely to provide products and services or to which we outsource certain functions. the same economic conditions that may affect our customers, as well as volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, also could adversely affect vendors and third parties and lead to significant increases in prices, reduction in output or the bankruptcy of our vendors or third parties upon which we rely. any interruption in the services provided by our vendors or by third parties could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operation and financial condition.
we face risks inherent in our commercial business.
we may encounter unforeseen difficulties as we increase the scale of our service offerings to businesses. we sell internet access, data networking and fiber connectivity to cellular towers and office buildings, video and business voice services to businesses and have increased our focus on growing this business. in order to grow our commercial business, we expect to continue investment in technology, equipment and personnel focused on the commercial business. commercial business customers often require service level agreements and generally have heightened customer expectations for reliability of services. if our efforts to build the infrastructure to scale the commercial business are not successful, the growth of our commercial services business would be limited. we depend on interconnection and related services provided by certain third parties for the growth of our commercial business. as a result, our ability to implement changes as the services grow may be limited. if we are unable to meet these service level requirements or expectations, our commercial business could be adversely affected. finally, we expect advances in communications technology, as well as changes in the marketplace and the regulatory and legislative environment. consequently, we are unable to predict the effect that ongoing or future developments in these areas might have on our voice and commercial businesses and operations.
23
programming costs are rising at a much faster rate than wages or inflation, and we may not have the ability to reduce or moderate the growth rates of, or pass on to our customers, our increasing programming costs, which would adversely affect our cash flow and operating margins.
video programming has been, and is expected to continue to be, our largest operating expense item. in recent years, the cable industry has experienced a rapid escalation in the cost of programming. we expect programming costs to continue to increase because of a variety of factors including amounts paid for broadcast station retransmission consent, annual increases imposed by programmers and carriage of incremental programming, including new services and vod programming. the inability to fully pass programming cost increases on to our customers has had, and is expected in the future to have, an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margins associated with the video product. we have programming contracts that have expired and others that will expire at or before the end of 2017. there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms. three programmers have filed lawsuits against us regarding which legacy programming arrangements apply after the closing of the transactions, and there can be no assurance that other programmers will not bring similar suits in the future. in addition, a number of programmers have begun to sell their services through alternative distribution channels which may cause those programmers to seek even higher programming fees from us as this may degrade security of their product, increase their operating costs or reduce their advertising revenue. to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms that we believe are reasonable, we have been, and may be in the future, forced to remove such programming channels from our line-up, which may result in a loss of customers. our failure to carry programming that is attractive to our subscribers could adversely impact our customer levels, operations and financial results. in addition, if our internet customers are unable to access desirable content online because content providers block or limit access by our subscribers as a class, our ability to gain and retain customers, especially internet customers, may be negatively impacted.
increased demands by owners of some broadcast stations for carriage of other services or payments to those broadcasters for retransmission consent are likely to further increase our programming costs. federal law allows commercial television broadcast stations to make an election between "must-carry" rights and an alternative "retransmission-consent" regime. when a station opts for the retransmission consent regime, we are not allowed to carry the station's signal without the station's permission. in some cases, we carry stations under short-term arrangements while we attempt to negotiate new long-term retransmission agreements. if negotiations with these programmers prove unsuccessful, they could require us to cease carrying their signals, possibly for an indefinite period. any loss of stations could make our video service less attractive to customers, which could result in less subscription and advertising revenue. in retransmission-consent negotiations, broadcasters often condition consent with respect to one station on carriage of one or more other stations or programming services in which they or their affiliates have an interest. carriage of these other services, as well as increased fees for retransmission rights, may increase our programming expenses and diminish the amount of capacity we have available to introduce new services, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
our inability to respond to technological developments and meet customer demand for new products and services could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.
we operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt, upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies to address consumers' changing demands and distinguish our services from those of our competitors. we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new products and services. if we choose technologies or equipment that are less effective, cost-efficient or attractive to customers than those chosen by our competitors, if we offer services that fail to appeal to consumers, are not available at competitive prices or that do not function as expected, or we are not able to fund the expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments, our competitive position could deteriorate, and our business and financial results could suffer.
the ability of some of our competitors to introduce new technologies, products and services more quickly than we do may adversely affect our competitive position. furthermore, advances in technology, decreases in the cost of existing technologies or changes in competitors' product and service offerings may require us in the future to make additional research and development expenditures or to offer at no additional charge or at a lower price certain products and services that we currently offer to customers separately or at a premium. in addition, the uncertainty of our ability, and the costs, to obtain intellectual property rights from third parties could impact our ability to respond to technological advances in a timely and effective manner.
the implementation of our network-based user interface, spectrum guide may ultimately be unsuccessful or more expensive than anticipated. our inability to maintain and expand our upgraded systems and provide advanced services such as a state of the art user interface in a timely manner, or to anticipate the demands of the marketplace, could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers. consequently, our growth, financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially.
24
we depend on third party service providers, suppliers and licensors; thus, if we are unable to procure the necessary services, equipment, software or licenses on reasonable terms and on a timely basis, our ability to offer services could be impaired, and our growth, operations, business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
we depend on a limited number of third party service providers, suppliers and licensors to supply some of the services, hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide some of our services. some of our hardware, software and operational support vendors, and service providers represent our sole source of supply or have, either through contract or as a result of intellectual property rights, a position of some exclusivity. if any of these parties breaches or terminates its agreement with us or otherwise fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner, demand exceeds these vendors' capacity, they experience operating or financial difficulties, they significantly increase the amount we pay for necessary products or services, or they cease production of any necessary product due to lack of demand, profitability or a change in ownership or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner, at our specifications and at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some services might be materially adversely affected, or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might delay our ability to serve our customers. in addition, the existence of only a limited number of vendors of key technologies can lead to less product innovation and higher costs. these events could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customers and our operations, business, financial results and financial condition.
our cable systems have historically been restricted to using one of two proprietary conditional access security systems, which we believe has limited the number of manufacturers producing set-top boxes for such systems. as an alternative, we developed a new conditional access security system which can be downloaded into set-top boxes with features we specify that could be provided by a variety of manufacturers. we refer to our specified set-top box as our worldbox. additionally, we are developing technology to allow our two current proprietary conditional access security systems to be software downloadable into our worldbox. in order to realize the broadest benefits of our worldbox technology, we must now complete the support for the downloadable proprietary conditional access security systems within the worldbox. we cannot provide assurances that this implementation will ultimately be successful or completed in the expected timeframe or at the expected budget.
our business may be adversely affected if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends.
we rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and licenses and other agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and the products and services used in our operations. also, because of the rapid pace of technological change, we both develop our own technologies, products and services and rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties. however, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged or invalidated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current industry trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product or service offerings or other competitive harm. we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from these third parties on reasonable terms, if at all. in addition, claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, which could require us to change our business practices or offerings and limit our ability to compete effectively. even unsuccessful claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert management's attention and resources away from our business. in recent years, the number of intellectual property infringement claims has been increasing in the communications and entertainment industries, and, with increasing frequency, we are party to litigation alleging that certain of our services or technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others.
various events could disrupt our networks, information systems or properties and could impair our operating activities and negatively impact our reputation and financial results.
network and information systems technologies are critical to our operating activities, both for our internal uses, such as network management and supplying services to our customers, including customer service operations and programming delivery. network or information system shutdowns or other service disruptions caused by events such as computer hacking, dissemination of computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, "cyber attacks," process breakdowns, denial of service attacks and other malicious activity pose increasing risks. both unsuccessful and successful "cyber attacks" on companies have continued to increase in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. while we develop and maintain systems seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as techniques used in such attacks become more sophisticated and change frequently. we, and the third parties on which we rely, may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. while from time to time attempts have been made to access our network, these attempts have not as yet resulted in any material release of information, degradation or disruption to our network and information systems.
25
our network and information systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, accidents, natural disasters (including extreme weather arising from short-term or any long-term changes in weather patterns), terrorist attacks and similar events. further, the impacts associated with extreme weather or long-term changes in weather patterns, such as rising sea levels or increased and intensified storm activity, may cause increased business interruptions or may require the relocation of some of our facilities. our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.
any of these events, if directed at, or experienced by, us or technologies upon which we depend, could have adverse consequences on our network, our customers and our business, including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to call centers, and damage to our or our customers' equipment and data. large expenditures may be necessary to repair or replace damaged property, networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. moreover, the amount and scope of insurance that we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result. any such significant service disruption could result in damage to our reputation and credibility, customer dissatisfaction and ultimately a loss of customers or revenue. any significant loss of customers or revenue, or significant increase in costs of serving those customers, could adversely affect our growth, financial condition and results of operations.
furthermore, our operating activities could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors, including customer, personnel and vendor data. we provide certain confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties in connection with our business, and there is a risk that this information may be compromised.
as a result of the increasing awareness concerning the importance of safeguarding personal information, the potential misuse of such information and legislation that has been adopted or is being considered regarding the protection, privacy and security of personal information, information-related risks are increasing, particularly for businesses like ours that process, store and transmit large amount of data, including personal information for our customers. we could be exposed to significant costs if such risks were to materialize, and such events could damage our reputation, credibility and business and have a negative impact on our revenue. we could be subject to regulatory actions and claims made by consumers in private litigations involving privacy issues related to consumer data collection and use practices. we also could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach.
the risk described above may be increased during the period in which we are integrating our people, processes and systems as a result of the transactions.
for tax purposes, charter could experience a deemed ownership change in the future that could limit its ability to use its tax loss carryforwards.
charter had approximately $11.2 billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately $3.9 billion as of december 31, 2016. these losses resulted from the operations of charter communications holdings company, llc ("charter holdco") and its subsidiaries and from loss carryforwards received as a result of the twc transaction. federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2018 through 2035. in addition, charter had state tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset (net of federal tax benefit) of approximately $304 million as of december 31, 2016. state tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the years 2017 through 2035.
in the past, charter has experienced "ownership changes" as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). in general, an "ownership change" occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by "5-percent stockholders" (within the meaning of section 382 of the code) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by such "5-percent stockholders" at any time over the preceding three years. as a result, charter is subject to an annual limitation on the use of its loss carryforwards which existed at november 30, 2009 for the first "ownership change," those that existed at may 1, 2013 for the second "ownership change," and those created at may 18, 2016 for the third "ownership change." the limitation on charter's ability to use its loss carryforwards, in conjunction with the loss carryforward expiration provisions, could reduce charter's ability to use a portion of its loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income, which could result in charter being required to make material cash tax payments. charter's ability to make such income tax payments, if any, will depend at such time on its liquidity or its ability to raise additional capital, and/or on receipt of payments or distributions from charter holdco and its subsidiaries.
if charter were to experience additional ownership changes in the future (as a result of purchases and sales of stock by its "5-percent stockholders," new issuances or redemptions of our stock, certain acquisitions of its stock and issuances, redemptions,
26
sales or other dispositions or acquisitions of interests in its "5-percent stockholders"), charter's ability to use its loss carryforwards could become subject to further limitations.
if legacy twc's separation transactions (as defined below), including the distribution (as defined below), do not qualify as tax-free, either as a result of actions taken or not taken by legacy twc or as a result of the failure of certain representations by legacy twc to be true, legacy twc has agreed to indemnify time warner inc. for its taxes resulting from such disqualification, which would be significant.
as part of legacy twc's separation from time warner inc. ("time warner") in march 2009 (the "separation"), time warner received a private letter ruling from the irs and time warner and twc received opinions of tax counsel confirming that the transactions undertaken in connection with the separation, including the transfer by a subsidiary of time warner of its 12.43% non-voting common stock interest in tw ny to twc in exchange for 80 million newly issued shares of legacy twc's class a common stock, legacy twc's payment of a special cash dividend to holders of legacy twc's outstanding class a and class b common stock, the conversion of each share of legacy twc's outstanding class a and class b common stock into one share of legacy twc common stock, and the pro-rata dividend of all shares of legacy twc common stock held by time warner to holders of record of time warner's common stock (the "distribution" and, together with all of the transactions, the "separation transactions"), should generally qualify as tax-free to time warner and its stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes. the ruling and opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from time warner and legacy twc regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, time warner and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions, the irs could determine on audit that the separation transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in the stock ownership of time warner or legacy twc after the distribution.
under the tax sharing agreement among time warner and legacy twc, legacy twc generally would be required to indemnify time warner against its taxes resulting from the failure of any of the separation transactions to qualify as tax-free as a result of (i) certain actions or failures to act by legacy twc or (ii) the failure of certain representations made by legacy twc to be true. in addition, even if legacy twc bears no contractual responsibility for taxes related to a failure of the separation transactions to qualify for their intended tax treatment, treasury regulation section 1.1502-6 imposes on legacy twc several liability for all time warner federal income tax obligations relating to the period during which legacy twc was a member of the time warner federal consolidated tax group, including the date of the separation transactions. similar provisions may apply under foreign, state or local law. absent legacy twc causing the separation transactions to not qualify as tax-free, time warner has indemnified legacy twc against such several liability arising from a failure of the separation transactions to qualify for their intended tax treatment.
if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to manage our business could be adversely affected.
our operational results have depended, and our future results will depend, upon the retention and continued performance of our management team. our ability to retain and hire new key employees for management positions could be impacted adversely by the competitive environment for management talent in the broadband communications industry. the loss of the services of key members of management and the inability or delay in hiring new key employees could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and our future operational and financial results.
our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses, assets, products or technologies could harm our operating results.
we continuously evaluate and pursue small and large acquisitions and strategic investments in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business or otherwise offer growth or cost-saving opportunities. from time to time, we may enter into letters of intent with companies with which we are negotiating for potential acquisitions or investments, or as to which we are conducting due diligence. an investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, products or technologies in the future could materially decrease the amount of our available cash or require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of any potential acquisition, conducting thorough due diligence, financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business, product or technology into our existing business and operations. our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or customer issues.
27
additionally, in connection with any acquisitions we complete, including the recently completed transactions, we may not achieve the growth, synergies or other financial and operating benefits we expected to achieve, and we may incur write-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities that could negatively affect our operating results or financial position or could otherwise harm our business. even if we are able to integrate the business operations obtained in such transactions successfully, it is not possible to predict with certainty if or when these cost synergies, growth opportunities and benefits will occur, or the extent to which they actually will be achieved. for example, the benefits from such transactions may be offset by costs incurred in integrating new business operations or in obtaining or attempting to obtain regulatory approvals, or increased operating costs that may be experienced as a result of the transactions. realization of any benefits and cost synergies could be affected by the factors described in other risk factors and a number of factors beyond our control, as applicable, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs, the response of competitors and vendors and regulatory developments. further, contemplating or completing an acquisition and integrating an acquired business, product or technology, individually or across multiple opportunities, could divert management and employee time and resources from other matters.
risks related to ownership position of liberty broadband corporation and advance/newhouse partnership liberty broadband and a/n have governance rights that give them influence over corporate transactions and other matters.
liberty broadband currently owns a significant amount of charter class a common stock and is entitled to certain governance rights with respect to charter. a/n currently owns charter class a common stock and a significant amount of membership interests in our subsidiary charter holdings that are convertible into our charter class a common stock and is entitled to certain governance rights with respect to charter. members of the charter board of directors include directors who are also officers and directors of liberty broadband and directors who are current or former officers and directors of a/n. dr. john malone is the chairman of liberty broadband, and mr. greg maffei is the president and chief executive officer of liberty broadband. steven miron is the chief executive officer of a/n and michael newhouse is an officer or director of several of a/n's affiliates. as of december 31, 2016, liberty broadband beneficially held approximately approximately 19% of charter's class a common stock (including shares owned by liberty interactive over which liberty broadband holds an irrevocable voting proxy) and a/n beneficially held approximately approximately 13% of charter's class a common stock, in each case assuming the conversion of the membership interests held by a/n. pursuant to the stockholders agreement between liberty broadband, a/n and charter, liberty broadband currently has the right to designate up to three directors as nominees for charter's board of directors and a/n currently has the right to designate up to two directors as nominees for charter's board of directors with one designated director to be appointed to each of the audit committee, the nominating and corporate governance committee, the compensation and benefits committee and the finance committee, in each case provided that each maintains certain specified voting or equity ownership thresholds and each nominee meets certain applicable requirements or qualifications.
in connection with the twc transaction, liberty broadband and liberty interactive entered into a proxy and right of first refusal agreement, pursuant to which liberty interactive granted liberty broadband an irrevocable proxy to vote all charter class a common stock owned beneficially or of record by liberty interactive, with certain exceptions. in addition, at the closing of the bright house transaction, a/n and liberty broadband entered into a proxy agreement pursuant to which a/n granted to liberty broadband a 5-year irrevocable proxy (which we refer to as the "a/n proxy") to vote, subject to certain exceptions, that number of shares of new charter class a common stock and new charter class b common stock, in each case held by a/n (such shares are referred to as the "proxy shares"), that will result in liberty broadband having voting power in charter equal to 25.01% of the outstanding voting power of charter, provided, that the voting power of the proxy shares is capped at 7.0% of the outstanding voting power of charter. therefore, giving effect to the liberty interactive proxy and the a/n proxy and the voting cap contained in the stockholders agreement, liberty broadband has 25.01% of the outstanding voting power in charter. the stockholders agreement and charter's amended and restated certificate of incorporation fixes the size of the board at 13 directors. liberty broadband and a/n are required to vote (subject to the applicable voting cap) their respective shares of charter class a common stock and charter class b common stock for the director nominees nominated by the nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors, including the respective designees of liberty broadband and a/n, and against any other nominees, except that, with respect to the unaffiliated directors, liberty broadband and a/n must instead vote in the same proportion as the voting securities are voted by stockholders other than a/n and liberty broadband or any group which includes any of them are voted, if doing so would cause a different outcome with respect to the unaffiliated directors. as a result of their rights under the stockholders agreement and their significant equity and voting stakes in charter, liberty broadband and/or a/n, who may have interests different from those of other stockholders, will be able to exercise substantial influence over certain matters relating to the governance of charter, including the approval of significant corporate actions, such as mergers and other business combination transactions.
28
the stockholders agreement provides a/n and liberty broadband with preemptive rights with respect to issuances of charter equity in connection with certain transactions, and in the event that a/n or liberty broadband exercises these rights, holders of charter class a common stock may experience further dilution.
the stockholders agreement provides that a/n and liberty broadband will have certain contractual preemptive rights over issuances of charter equity securities in connection with capital raising transactions, merger and acquisition transactions, and in certain other circumstances. holders of charter class a common stock will not be entitled to similar preemptive rights with respect to such transactions. as a result, if liberty broadband and/or a/n elect to exercise their preemptive rights, (i) these parties would not experience the dilution experienced by the other holders of charter class a common stock, and (ii) such other holders of charter class a common stock may experience further dilution of their interest in charter upon such exercise.
risks related to regulatory and legislative matters our business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation, which could adversely affect our business.
regulation of the cable industry has increased cable operators' operational and administrative expenses and limited their revenues. cable operators are subject to various laws and regulations including those covering the following:
•   the provisioning and marketing of cable equipment and compatibility with new digital technologies;
•   customer and employee privacy and data security;
•   limited rate regulation of video service;
•   copyright royalties for retransmitting broadcast signals;
•   when a cable system must carry a particular broadcast station and when it must first obtain retransmission consent to carry a broadcast station;
•   the provision of channel capacity to unaffiliated commercial leased access programmers;
•   limitations on our ability to enter into exclusive agreements with multiple dwelling unit complexes and control our inside wiring;
•   the provision of high-speed internet service, including net neutrality or open internet rules;
•   the provision of voice communications;
•   cable franchise renewals and transfers;
•   equal employment opportunity, emergency alert systems, disability access, technical standards, marketing practices, customer service, and consumer protection; and
•   approval for mergers and acquisitions often accompanied by the imposition of restrictions and requirements on an applicant's business in order to secure approval of the proposed transaction.
legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or prescribe new ones. any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses. for example, with respect to our retail broadband internet access service, the fcc has (1) reclassified the service as a title ii service, (2) applied certain existing title ii provisions and associated regulations to it, (3) forborne from applying a range of other existing title ii provisions and associated regulations, but to varying degrees indicated that this forbearance may be only temporary, and (4) issued new rules expanding disclosure requirements and prohibiting blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, and unreasonable interference with the ability of end users and edge providers to reach each other. the order also subjected broadband providers' internet traffic exchange rates and practices to potential fcc oversight for the first time and created a mechanism for third parties to file complaints regarding these matters. these fcc actions were upheld on appeal in june 2016, although additional appeals remain pending.
as a result of the reclassification of broadband internet access service as a title ii communications service, the fcc adopted new privacy and data security rules for common carriers, interconnected voip providers, and broadband service providers on october 27, 2016. the new rules replace the prior rules and extend broader privacy protections to broadband customers, as well as voice service customers. the new rules place heightened restrictions on the use of customer information that internet service providers obtain from the provision of broadband internet access service (including increased notice, consumer choice, and security), and are more restrictive than other existing privacy and security frameworks. the new rules are subject to additional regulatory approval and legal challenges.
changes to existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or adoption of new ones, could have an adverse effect on our business.
there are ongoing efforts to amend or expand the federal, state, and local regulation of some of the services offered over our cable systems, which may compound the regulatory risks we already face. for example, the fcc recently issued a proposal to impose
29
new regulations on our point to point transport service as well as other commercial data services ("business data services"). as a result, the fcc may price regulate business data services as common carriage services and impose additional restrictions on contracting terms. the fcc also has considered adopting new navigation device rules, pursuant to section 629 of the communications act, which directs the fcc to assure the availability of navigation devices (such as set-top boxes) from third party providers. in 2016, the fcc proposed burdensome new rules that would have required us to make disaggregated "information flows" available to set-top boxes and apps supplied by third parties. that proposal has not been adopted, but various parties may continue to advocate alternative regulatory approaches to reduce consumer dependency on traditional operator provided set-top boxes. the fcc also is considering the appropriate regulatory framework for voip service, including whether that service should be regulated under title ii.
congress is considering legislation that could increase costs on the company, including (1) the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation that could result in additional network and information security requirements for our business, (2) a change in corporate tax laws that could eliminate some of our current deductions, and (3) broadband subsidies to rural areas that could result in subsidized overbuilding of our more rural facilities.
if any of these pending laws and regulations are enacted, they could affect our operations and require significant expenditures. we cannot predict future developments in these areas, and we are already subject to charter-specific conditions regarding certain internet practices as a result of the fcc's approval of the transactions, but any changes to the regulatory framework for our internet or voip services could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.
it remains uncertain what rule changes, if any, will ultimately be adopted by congress and the fcc and what operating or financial impact any such rules might have on us, including on our programming agreements, customer privacy and the user experience. in addition, the fcc's enforcement bureau has been actively investigating certain industry practices of various companies and imposing forfeitures for alleged regulatory violations.
our cable system franchises are subject to non-renewal or termination. the failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect our business.
our cable systems generally operate pursuant to franchises, permits, and similar authorizations issued by a state or local governmental authority controlling the public rights-of-way. many franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. in many cases, franchises are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provisions set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operations. franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate. franchise authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal. in some instances, local franchises have not been renewed at expiration, and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreements or without a franchise while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities.
we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all significant provisions of our franchise agreements and certain of our franchisers have from time to time alleged that we have not complied with these agreements. additionally, although historically we have renewed our franchises without incurring significant costs, we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew, or to renew as favorably, our franchises in the future. a termination of or a sustained failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect our business in the affected geographic area.
our cable system franchises are non-exclusive. accordingly, local and state franchising authorities can grant additional franchises and create additional competition for our products, resulting in overbuilds, which could adversely affect results of operations.
our cable system franchises are non-exclusive. consequently, local and state franchising authorities can grant additional franchises to competitors in the same geographic area or operate their own cable systems. in some cases, local government entities and municipal utilities may legally compete with us on more favorable terms. potential competitors (like google) have recently pursued and obtained local franchises that are more favorable than the incumbent operator's franchise.
the fcc has adopted rules that streamline entry for new competitors (particularly those affiliated with telephone companies) and reduce franchising burdens for these new entrants. at the same time, a substantial number of states have adopted new franchising laws, principally designed to streamline entry for new competitors, and often provide advantages for these new entrants that are not immediately available to existing operators.
30
broadband delivery of video content is not necessarily subject to the same franchising obligations applicable to our traditional cable systems. the fcc administers a program that collects universal service fund contributions from telecommunications service providers and uses them to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in high-cost areas and to low-income consumers and the provision of internet and telecommunications services to schools, libraries and certain health care providers. a variety of regulatory changes may lead the fcc to expand the collection of universal service fund contributions to encompass internet service providers. the fcc already has begun to redirect the expenditure of some universal service fund subsidies to broadband deployment in ways that could assist competitors.
local franchise authorities have the ability to impose additional regulatory constraints on our business, which could further increase our expenses.
in addition to the franchise agreement, cable authorities in some jurisdictions have adopted cable regulatory ordinances that further regulate the operation of cable systems. this additional regulation increases the cost of operating our business. local franchising authorities may impose new and more restrictive requirements. local franchising authorities who are certified to regulate rates in the communities where they operate generally have the power to reduce rates and order refunds on the rates charged for basic service and equipment.
tax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we operate cable systems in locations throughout the united states and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of federal, state and local governments. from time to time, various legislative and/or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. certain states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on our services or changing the methodologies or base on which certain fees and taxes are computed. potential changes include additional taxes or fees on our services which could impact our customers, combined reporting and other changes to general business taxes, central/unit-level assessment of property taxes and other matters that could increase our income, franchise, sales, use and/or property tax liabilities. in addition, federal, state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.
further regulation of the cable industry could impair our ability to raise rates to cover our increasing costs, resulting in increased losses.
currently, rate regulation of cable systems is strictly limited to the basic service tier and associated equipment and installation activities, and the fcc recently revised its rules, in response to changed market conditions, to make it more difficult for local franchising authorities to assert rate regulation authority. however, the fcc and congress continue to be concerned that cable rate increases are exceeding inflation. it is possible that either the fcc or congress will further restrict the ability of cable system operators to implement rate increases for our video services or even for our internet and voice services. should this occur, it would impede our ability to raise our rates. if we are unable to raise our rates in response to increasing costs, our financial results would be adversely impacted.
there has been legislative and regulatory interest in requiring companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of them available on a standalone, rather than a bundled basis to cable operators, and in requiring cable operators to offer historically bundled programming services on an á la carte basis to consumers. while any new regulation or legislation designed to enable cable operators to purchase programming on a standalone basis could be beneficial to us, any regulation or legislation that limits how we sell programming could adversely affect our business.
changes in channel carriage regulations could impose significant additional costs on us.
cable operators also face significant regulation of their video channel carriage. we can be required to devote substantial capacity to the carriage of programming that we might not carry voluntarily, including certain local broadcast signals; local public, educational and governmental access ("peg") programming; and unaffiliated, commercial leased access programming (required channel capacity for use by persons unaffiliated with the cable operator who desire to distribute programming over a cable system). the fcc adopted revised commercial leased access rules which would dramatically reduce the rate we can charge for leasing this capacity and dramatically increase our administrative burdens, but these remain stayed while under appeal. legislation has been introduced in congress in the past that, if adopted, could impact our carriage of broadcast signals by eliminating the cable industry's compulsory copyright license. the fcc also continues to consider changes to the rules affecting the relationship between programmers (including broadcasters) and multichannel video distributors, including potential loosening of media ownership rules.
31
future regulatory changes could disrupt existing programming commitments, interfere with our preferred use of limited channel capacity, increase our programming costs, and limit our ability to offer services that would maximize our revenue potential. it is possible that other legal restraints will be adopted limiting our discretion over programming decisions.
our voice service is subject to regulatory burdens which may increase, causing us to incur additional costs.
we offer voice communications services over our broadband network using voip services. the fcc has ruled that competitive telephone companies that support voip services, such as those we offer our customers, are entitled to interconnect with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications services, which ensures that our voip services can compete in the market. the scope of these interconnection rights are being reviewed in a current fcc proceeding, which may affect our ability to compete in the provision of voice services or result in additional costs. the fcc has also declared that certain voip services are not subject to traditional state public utility regulation. the full extent of the fcc preemption of state and local regulation of voip services is not yet clear, and at least one state (minnesota) has asserted jurisdiction over the company's voip services. we have filed a legal challenge to that jurisdictional assertion, which is now pending before a federal district court in minnesota. telecommunications companies generally are subject to other significant regulation which could also be extended to voip providers. the fcc has already extended certain traditional telecommunications carrier requirements to many voip providers such as us. if additional telecommunications regulations are applied to our voip service, it could cause us to incur additional costs.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
reference is made to "part i. item 1a. risk factors" and "cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements," which describe important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein. in addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of charter communications, inc. and subsidiaries included in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
overview we are the second largest cable operator in the united states and a leading broadband communications services company providing video, internet and voice services to approximately 26.2 million residential and business customers at december 31, 2016. in addition, we sell video and online advertising inventory to local, regional and national advertising customers and fiber-delivered communications and managed it solutions to larger enterprise customers. we also own and operate regional sports networks and local sports, news and community channels and sell security and home management services to the residential marketplace. see
37
"part i. item 1. business - products and services" for further description of these services, including customer statistics for different services.
since 2012, legacy charter has actively invested in its network and operations and improved the quality and value of the products and packages that legacy charter offered. through the roll-out of spectrum pricing and packaging we have simplified our offers and improved our packaging of products, delivering more value to new and existing customers. further, through the transition of our legacy charter markets to our all-digital platform, we increased our offerings to more than 200 hd channels in most of the legacy charter markets and offered internet speeds of at least 60 or 100 mbps, among other benefits. we believe that this product set combined with improved customer service, as we insource our workforce in our call centers and in our field operations, has led to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetimes.
as a result of the transactions, 2016 revenues increased by over $18.6 billion year over year. we also saw an increase in expenses related to our increased scale. in september 2016, we began launching spp to legacy twc markets and we expect that by mid 2017, we will offer spp in all legacy twc and legacy bright house markets. in 2017, we intend to begin converting the remaining legacy twc and legacy bright house analog markets to an all-digital platform. our corporate organization, as well as our marketing, sales and product development departments, are now centralized. field operations are managed through eleven regional areas, each designed to represent a combination of designated marketing areas and managed with largely the same set of field employees that were with the three legacy companies prior to completion of the transactions. over a multi-year period, legacy twc and legacy bright house customer care centers will migrate to legacy charter's model of using segmented, virtualized, u.s.-based in-house call centers. we will focus on deploying superior products and service with minimal service disruptions as we integrate our information technology and network operations. we expect customer and financial results to trend similar to legacy charter following the implementation of the legacy charter operating strategies across the legacy twc and legacy bright house markets. as a result of implementing our operating strategy at legacy twc and legacy bright house, we cannot be certain that we will be able to grow revenues or maintain our margins at recent historical rates.

adjusted ebitda is defined as consolidated net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, net, other (income) expense, net and other operating (income) expenses, such as merger and restructuring costs, other pension benefits, special charges and gain (loss) on sale or retirement of assets. see "-use of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow" for further information on adjusted ebitda and free cash flow.  growth in total revenue, adjusted ebitda and income from operations was primarily due to the transactions.
on a pro forma basis, assuming the transactions occurred as of january 1, 2015, total revenue growth was primarily due to growth in our internet and commercial businesses. on a pro forma basis, adjusted ebitda growth was primarily due to an increase in residential and commercial revenues offset by increases in programming costs and other operating costs. in addition to the factors discussed above, income from operations on a pro forma basis was affected by increases in depreciation and amortization, merger and restructuring costs and stock compensation expense.
approximately 90%, 91% and 90% of our revenues for years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our video, internet, voice and commercial services provided by our cable systems. generally, these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to a fee for
38
certain commercial customers. the remaining 10%, 9% and 10% of revenue for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise and other regulatory fee revenues (which are collected by us but then paid to local authorities), pay-per-view and vod programming, installation, processing fees or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate service, and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services.

amounts included in transition operating expenses and transition capital expenditures represent incremental costs incurred to integrate the legacy twc and legacy bright house operations and to bring the three companies' systems and processes into a uniform operating structure.  costs are incremental and would not be incurred absent the integration.  other operating expenses associated with the transactions represent merger and restructuring costs and include advisory, legal and accounting fees, employee retention costs, employee termination costs and other exit costs.  interest expense associated with the transactions represents interest incurred on the cco safari ii, cco safari iii and ccoh safari notes issued in advance of the closing of the transactions, the proceeds of which were held in escrow to finance the transactions.
we have a history of net losses.  our net losses were principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover the combination of operating expenses, interest expenses that we incur on our debt, depreciation expenses resulting from the capital investments we have made, and continue to make, in our cable properties, amortization expenses related to our customer relationship intangibles and higher non-cash income tax expense. we will incur significant increases in interest expense and depreciation and amortization as a result of the transactions and will incur restructuring and transition costs for at least one to two years, and as a result, absent non-recurring impacts such as the reversal of the income tax valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2016, we may incur net losses in the future.
critical accounting policies and estimates certain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments. management has discussed these policies with the audit committee of charter's board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed the following disclosure. we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates, assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements, and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows:
•   property, plant and equipment
•   capitalization of labor and overhead costs
•   valuation and impairment of property, plant and equipment
•   useful lives of property, plant and equipment
•   intangible assets
•   valuation and impairment of franchises
•   valuation and impairment of goodwill
•   valuation and impairment and amortization of customer relationships
•   income taxes
•   litigation
•   programming agreements
•   pension plans in addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimates or judgment that are not deemed critical, such as the allowance for doubtful accounts and valuations of our financial instruments, but changes in estimates or judgment in these other items could also have a material impact on our financial statements.
39
property, plant and equipment the cable industry is capital intensive, and a large portion of our resources are spent on capital activities associated with extending, rebuilding, and upgrading our cable network. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the net carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment (consisting primarily of cable distribution systems) was approximately $33.0 billion (representing 22% of total assets) and $8.3 billion (representing 49% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. total capital expenditures for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $5.3 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.
capitalization of labor and overhead costs. costs associated with network construction, initial placement of the customer drop to the dwelling and the initial placement of outlets within a dwelling along with the costs associated with the initial deployment of customer premise equipment necessary to provide video, internet or voices services, are capitalized.  costs capitalized include materials, direct labor, and certain indirect costs. these indirect costs are associated with the activities of personnel who assist in installation activities, and consist of compensation and overhead costs associated with these support functions.  while our capitalization is based on specific activities, once capitalized, we track these costs on a composite basis by fixed asset category at the cable system level, and not on a specific asset basis.  for assets that are sold or retired, we remove the estimated applicable cost and accumulated depreciation.  the costs of disconnecting service and removing customer premise equipment from a dwelling and the costs to reconnect a customer drop or to redeploy previously installed customer premise equipment are charged to operating expensed as incurred. costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while plant and equipment replacement, including replacement of certain components, betterments, and replacement of cable drops and outlets, are capitalized.
we make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized. we capitalize direct labor and overhead using standards developed from actual costs and applicable operational data. we calculate standards annually (or more frequently if circumstances dictate) for items such as the labor rates, overhead rates, and the actual amount of time required to perform a capitalizable activity. for example, the standard amounts of time required to perform capitalizable activities are based on studies of the time required to perform such activities. overhead rates are established based on an analysis of the nature of costs incurred in support of capitalizable activities, and a determination of the portion of costs that is directly attributable to capitalizable activities. the impact of changes that resulted from these studies were not material in the periods presented.
labor costs directly associated with capital projects are capitalized. capitalizable activities performed in connection with installations include such activities as:
•   dispatching a "truck roll" to the customer's dwelling or business for service connection or placement of new equipment;
•   verification of serviceability to the customer's dwelling or business (i.e., determining whether the customer's dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network and/or receiving advanced or internet services);
•   customer premise activities performed by in-house field technicians and third-party contractors in connection with customer installations, installation of equipment in connection with the installation of video, internet or voice services, and equipment replacement and betterment; and
•   verifying the integrity of the customer's network connection by initiating test signals downstream from the headend to the customer's digital set-top box, as well as testing signal levels at the pole or pedestal.
judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead costs incurred result from specific capital activities, and therefore should be capitalized. the primary costs that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor, (ii) direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities, (iii) the cost of support personnel, such as care personnel and dispatchers, who assist with capitalizable installation activities, and (iv) indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities.
while we believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate, a significant change in the nature or extent of our system activities could affect management's judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future. we monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies, and perform updates to our internal studies on an ongoing basis to determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change to our capitalization policies. we capitalized direct labor and overhead of $991 million, $420 million and $427 million, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
valuation and impairment of property, plant and equipment. we evaluate the recoverability of our property, plant and equipment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. such events or changes in circumstances could include such factors as the impairment of our indefinite life franchises, changes in technological advances, fluctuations in the fair value of such assets, adverse changes in relationships with local franchise authorities, adverse changes in market conditions, or a deterioration of current or expected future operating results. a long-lived
40
asset is deemed impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset. no impairments of long-lived assets to be held and used were recorded in the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
we utilize the cost approach as the primary method used to establish fair value for our property, plant and equipment in connection with business combinations.  the cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing a new asset with similar utility, then adjusts the value in consideration of physical depreciation and functional and economic obsolescence as of the appraisal date. the cost approach relies on management's assumptions regarding current material and labor costs required to rebuild and repurchase significant components of our property, plant and equipment along with assumptions regarding the age and estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.
useful lives of property, plant and equipment. we evaluate the appropriateness of estimated useful lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment, based on annual analysis of such useful lives, and revise such lives to the extent warranted by changing facts and circumstances. any changes in estimated useful lives as a result of this analysis are reflected prospectively beginning in the period in which the study is completed. our analysis of useful lives in 2016 did not indicate a change in useful lives.  the effect of a one-year decrease in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property, plant and equipment as of december 31, 2016 would be an increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately $1.7 billion.  the effect of a one-year increase in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property, plant and equipment as of december 31, 2016 would be a decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately $863 million.
depreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment totaled $5.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing approximately 19%, 21% and 22% of costs and expenses, respectively. depreciation is recorded using the straight-line composite method over management's estimate of the useful lives of the related assets as listed below:
cable distribution systems                      7-20 years customer premise equipment and installations     3-8 years vehicles and equipment                           3-6 years buildings and improvements                     15-40 years furniture, fixtures and equipment               6-10 years intangible assets valuation and impairment of franchises. the net carrying value of franchises as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $67.3 billion (representing 45% of total assets) and $6.0 billion (representing 35% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. for more information and a complete discussion of how we value and test franchise assets for impairment, see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
we perform an impairment assessment of franchise assets annually or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances. we performed a qualitative assessment in 2016. our assessment included consideration of the fair value appraisals of legacy charter and the newly-acquired operations performed as of the date of acquisition for tax and acquisition accounting purposes, respectively, along with a multitude of factors that affect the fair value of our franchise assets. examples of such factors include environmental and competitive changes within our operating footprint, actual and projected operating performance, the consistency of our operating margins, equity and debt market trends, including changes in our market capitalization, and changes in our regulatory and political landscape, among other factors. based on our assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our franchise assets equals or exceeds their carrying values and that a quantitative impairment test is not required.
the appraisals indicated that the fair value of our franchise assets exceeded carrying value by approximately 25% in the aggregate, with the excess entirely attributable to the franchise assets of legacy charter to which acquisition accounting was not applied. at our unit of accounting level for franchise asset impairment testing, the amount by which fair value exceeds carrying value varies based on the extent to which the unit of accounting was comprised of newly-acquired operations. for units of accounting comprised entirely or substantially of newly-acquired operations, we believe the carrying value approximates the fair value given that there has been no significant adverse changes in factors impacting our fair value estimates since the transaction date. for units of accounting comprised of at least 25% legacy charter operations, the fair value exceeded carrying value by a range of 36% to 260%.
41
valuation and impairment of goodwill. the net carrying value of goodwill as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $29.5 billion (representing 20% of total assets) and $1.2 billion (representing 7% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. for more information and a complete discussion on how we test goodwill for impairment, see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data." we perform our impairment assessment of goodwill annually as of november 30th. as with our franchise impairment testing, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill in 2016 which included the fair value appraisals and other factors described above. based on the appraisals, we determined that the fair value of our goodwill exceeded carrying value by approximately 28% as of the closing of the transactions. given the limited amount of time between the closing of the transactions and the completion of the assessment and absence of significant adverse changes in factors impacting our fair value estimates, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our goodwill is not impaired.
valuation, impairment and amortization of customer relationships. the net carrying value of customer relationships as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $14.6 billion (representing 10% of total assets) and $856 million (representing 5% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. amortization expense related to customer relationships for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $1.9 billion, $249 million and $282 million, respectively. no impairment of customer relationships was recorded in the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. for more information and a complete discussion on our valuation methodology and amortization method, see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
income taxes as of december 31, 2016, charter had approximately $11.2 billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately $3.9 billion. these losses resulted from the operations of charter holdco and its subsidiaries and from loss carryforwards received as a result of the twc transaction. federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2018 through 2035. in addition, as of december 31, 2016, charter had state tax net operating loss carryforwards, resulting in a gross deferred tax asset (net of federal tax benefit) of approximately $304 million. state tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the years 2017 through 2035.  such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset charter's future taxable income. as of december 31, 2016, all of charter's federal tax loss carryforwards are subject to section 382 and other restrictions. pursuant to these restrictions, charter estimates that approximately $5.4 billion in 2017, $3.8 billion in 2018, $432 million in 2019 and an additional $226 million annually over each of the next five years of federal tax loss carryforwards, should become unrestricted and available for charter's use. an additional $415 million is currently subject to a valuation allowance. charter's state tax loss carryforwards are subject to similar but varying restrictions.
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management takes into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. due to legacy charter's history of losses, legacy charter was historically unable to assume future taxable income in its analysis and accordingly valuation allowances were established against the deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, from definite-lived assets for book accounting purposes. however, as a result of the twc transaction, deferred tax liabilities resulting from the book fair value adjustment increased significantly and future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities are recognized, is sufficient to conclude it is more likely than not that we will realize substantially all of our deferred tax assets. as a result, charter has reversed approximately $3.3 billion of its valuation allowance and recognized a corresponding income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016. approximately $145 million of valuation allowance associated with federal tax net operating loss carryforwards and approximately $55 million of valuation allowance associated with state tax loss carryforwards and other miscellaneous deferred tax assets remains on the december 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet.
in determining our tax provision for financial reporting purposes, charter establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless such positions are determined to be "more likely than not" of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved. there is considerable judgment involved in determining whether positions taken on the tax return are "more likely than not" of being sustained. charter adjusts its uncertain tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations.
42
no tax years for charter, charter holdings or charter holdco, for income tax purposes, are currently under examination by the irs. charter and charter holdings' 2016 tax year remains open for assessment. legacy charter's tax years ending 2013 through the short period return dated may 17, 2016 remain subject to examination and assessment. years prior to 2013 remain open solely for purposes of examination of legacy charter's loss and credit carryforwards. the irs is currently examining legacy twc's income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. legacy twc's tax years ending 2013 through 2015 remain subject to examination and assessment. prior to legacy twc's separation from time warner inc. ("time warner") in march 2009 (the "separation"), legacy twc was included in the consolidated u.s. federal and certain state income tax returns of time warner. the irs is currently examining time warner's 2008 through 2010 income tax returns. time warner's income tax returns for 2005 to 2007, which are periods prior to the separation, were settled with the exception of an immaterial item that has been referred to the irs appeals division. we have unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest and penalties, totaling approximately $172 million and $5 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
litigation legal contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty. when a loss from a contingency becomes estimable and probable, a reserve is established. the reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised as facts and circumstances change. a reserve is released when a matter is ultimately brought to closure or the statute of limitations lapses. we have established reserves for certain matters. although these matters are not expected individually to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, such matters could have, in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
programming agreements we exercise significant judgment in estimating programming expense associated with certain video programming contracts. our policy is to record video programming costs based on our contractual agreements with our programming vendors, which are generally multi-year agreements that provide for us to make payments to the programming vendors at agreed upon market rates based on the number of customers to which we provide the programming service. if a programming contract expires prior to the parties' entry into a new agreement and we continue to distribute the service, we estimate the programming costs during the period there is no contract in place. in doing so, we consider the previous contractual rates, inflation and the status of the negotiations in determining our estimates. when the programming contract terms are finalized, an adjustment to programming expense is recorded, if necessary, to reflect the terms of the new contract. we also make estimates in the recognition of programming expense related to other items, such as the accounting for free periods, timing of rate increases and credits from service interruptions, as well as the allocation of consideration exchanged between the parties in multiple-element transactions.
significant judgment is also involved when we enter into agreements that result in us receiving cash consideration from the programming vendor, usually in the form of advertising sales, channel positioning fees, launch support or marketing support. in these situations, we must determine based upon facts and circumstances if such cash consideration should be recorded as revenue, a reduction in programming expense or a reduction in another expense category (e.g., marketing).
pension plans upon completion of the twc transaction, we assumed legacy twc's pension plans. we sponsor two qualified defined benefit pension plans, the twc pension plan and the twc union pension plan (collectively, the "twc pension plans"), that provide pension benefits to a majority of legacy twc employees. we also provide a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain employees under the twc excess pension plan. as of december 31, 2016, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the twc pension plans was $3.3 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, and the net underfunded liability of the twc pension plans was recorded as a $1 million noncurrent asset, $6 million current liability and $309 million long-term liability.
pension benefits are based on formulas that reflect the employees' years of service and compensation during their employment period. actuarial gains or losses are changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions. we have elected to follow a mark-to-market pension accounting policy for recording the actuarial gains or losses annually during the fourth quarter, or earlier if a remeasurement event occurs during an interim period. we use a december 31 measurement date for our pension plans.
we recognized a net periodic pension benefit of $813 million in 2016. net periodic pension benefit or expense is determined using certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate and expected rate of compensation increases. we determined the discount rate used to compute pension expense based on the yield of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds with cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future defined benefit payments. in developing the expected long-term rate of return on assets, we considered the current pension portfolio's composition, past
43
average rate of earnings, and our asset allocation targets. we used a discount rate of 3.99% from the date of the transaction to june 30, 2016, and 3.72% from july 1, 2016 to december 31, 2016 to compute 2016 pension expense. a decrease in the discount rate of 25 basis points would result in a $154 million increase in our pension plan benefit obligation as of december 31, 2016 and net periodic pension expense recognized in 2016 under our mark-to-market accounting policy. our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to compute 2016 pension expense was 6.50%. a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return of 25 basis points, from 6.50% to 6.25%, while holding all other assumptions constant, would result in an increase in our 2017 net periodic pension expense of approximately $7 million. see note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for additional discussion on these assumptions.

programming costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for basic, digital, premium, vod, and pay-per-view programming. the increase in pro forma programming costs is primarily a result of annual contractual rate adjustments, including increases in amounts paid for retransmission consents and the introduction of new networks offset by synergies as a result of the transactions and lower pay-per-view programming expenses.  we expect pro forma programming expenses will continue to increase due to a variety of factors, including annual increases imposed by programmers with additional selling power as a result of media consolidation, increased demands by owners of broadcast stations for payment for retransmission consent or linking carriage of other services to retransmission consent, and additional programming, particularly new services. we have been unable to fully pass these increases on to our customers nor do we expect to be able to do so in the future without a potential loss of customers.
on a pro forma basis, assuming the transactions occurred as of january 1, 2015, the increase in other expense is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):
2016 compared to 2015
advertising sales expense                 $100
corporate costs                             86
stock compensation expense                  49
enterprise                                  48
bank fees                                   33
$316
the increase in advertising sales expense relates primarily to higher advertising sales revenue. the increase in corporate costs relates primarily to increases in the number of employees including increases in engineering and it. stock compensation expense increased primarily due to increases in headcount and the value of equity issued.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization expense increased by $4.8 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of additional depreciation and amortization related to the transactions, inclusive of the incremental amounts as a result of the higher fair values recorded in acquisition accounting. depreciation and amortization expense increased by $23 million in 2015 compared to 2014 which primarily represents depreciation on more recent capital expenditures offset by certain assets becoming fully depreciated.
other operating expenses, net. the changes in other operating expenses, net are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):
2016 compared to 2015            2015 compared to 2014
merger and restructuring costs                       $900                              $32
other pension benefits                               (899         )                      -

$(3         )                    $27
the increase in merger and restructuring costs is primarily due to approximately $262 million of legacy charter and legacy twc contingent financing and advisory transaction fees paid at the closing of the transactions as well as approximately $642 million of employee retention and employee termination costs incurred during 2016. other pension benefits includes the pension curtailment gain of $675 million, remeasurement gain of $195 million, expected return on plan assets of $116 million offset by interest costs of $87 million. for more information, see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
interest expense, net.  net interest expense increased by $1.2 billion in 2016 from 2015 and by $395 million in 2015 from 2014 primarily as a result of an increase of $463 million and $446 million, respectively, of interest expense associated with the debt incurred to fund the transactions, and, in 2016, $604 million associated with debt assumed from legacy twc.
49
loss on extinguishment of debt. loss on extinguishment of debt of $111 million and $128 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 primarily represents losses recognized as a result of the repurchase of cco holdings notes. for more information, see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
gain (loss) on financial instruments, net. interest rate derivative instruments are used to manage our interest costs and to reduce our exposure to increases in floating interest rates, and cross-currency derivative instruments are used to manage foreign exchange risk related to the foreign currency denominated debt assumed in the twc transaction. we recorded gains of $89 million and losses of $4 million and $7 million during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. gains and losses on financial instruments are recognized due to changes in the fair value of our interest rate and, in 2016 our cross currency derivative instruments and the remeasurement of the fixed-rate british pound sterling denominated notes (the "sterling notes") into u.s. dollars. the year ended december 31, 2016 also includes an $11 million loss realized upon termination of legacy twc interest rate swap derivative instruments. for more information, see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
other expense, net. other expense, net primarily represents equity losses on our equity-method investments. for more information, see note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
income tax benefit (expense). we recognized income tax benefits of $2.9 billion and $60 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and income tax expense of $236 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. certain of the deferred tax liabilities that were assumed in connection with the closing of the twc transaction will reverse and provide a source of future taxable income, resulting in a reduction of approximately $3.3 billion of legacy charter's preexisting valuation allowance associated with its deferred tax assets. such release of legacy charter's valuation allowance was recognized directly to income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016. income tax benefit for the year ended december 31, 2016 was also impacted by a change in a state tax law that resulted in approximately $65 million of tax benefit. the tax provision in future periods will vary based on current and future temporary differences, as well as future operating results. for more information, see note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
the income tax benefit in 2015 was primarily due to the deemed liquidation of charter holdco solely for federal and state income tax purposes, resulting in a $187 million deferred income tax benefit offset by income tax expense primarily through increases in deferred tax liabilities. income tax expense was recognized in 2015 and 2014 primarily through increases in deferred tax liabilities related to legacy charter's franchises, which are characterized as indefinite lived for book financial reporting purposes, as well as, to a lesser extent, through current federal and state income tax expense.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for financial reporting purposes represents a/n's portion of charter holdings' net income based on its effective common unit ownership interest of approximately 10% and on the preferred dividend of $93 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. for more information, see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "item 1. financial statements."
net income (loss) attributable to charter shareholders. net income attributable to charter shareholders was $3.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 and net loss attributable to charter shareholders was $271 million and $183 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily as a result of the factors described above. on a pro forma basis, assuming the transactions occurred as of january 1, 2015, net income attributable to charter shareholders was $1.1 billion and $159 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
use of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow we use certain measures that are not defined by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") to evaluate various aspects of our business. adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are non-gaap financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, consolidated net income (loss) and net cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with gaap. these terms, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are reconciled to consolidated net income (loss) and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, below.
adjusted ebitda is defined as consolidated net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, other (income) expense, net and other operating (income) expenses, such as merger and restructuring costs, other pension benefits, special charge

s and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. as such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of our businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. however, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and our cash cost of financing. these costs are evaluated through other financial measures.
free cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.
we believe that adjusted ebitda and free cash flow provide information useful to investors in assessing our performance and our ability to service our debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. in addition, adjusted ebitda generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under our credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the sec). for the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, we use adjusted ebitda, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by our operating subsidiaries to other charter entities. our debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees, which fees were in the amount of $930 million, $322 million and $253 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

liquidity and capital resources overview we have significant amounts of debt.  the principal amount of our debt as of december 31, 2016 was $60.0 billion, consisting of $8.9 billion of credit facility debt, $37.7 billion of investment grade senior secured notes and $13.4 billion of high-yield senior unsecured notes. our business requires significant cash to fund principal and interest payments on our debt.
our projected cash needs and projected sources of liquidity depend upon, among other things, our actual results, and the timing and amount of our expenditures. free cash flow was $3.3 billion, $547 million and $171 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. as of december 31, 2016, the amount available under our credit facilities was approximately $2.8 billion and cash on hand was approximately $1.5 billion. we expect to utilize free cash flow, cash on hand and availability under our credit facilities as well as future refinancing transactions to further extend the maturities of or reduce the principal on our obligations. the timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to market conditions. additionally, we may, from time to time, and depending on market conditions and other factors, use cash on hand and the proceeds from securities offerings or other borrowings to retire our debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, tender offers or redemption provisions. we believe we have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand, free cash flow and charter operating's revolving credit facility as well as access to the capital markets to fund our projected cash needs.
we continue to evaluate the deployment of our cash on hand and anticipated future free cash flow including to invest in our business growth and other strategic opportunities, including mergers and acquisitions as well as stock repurchases and dividends. our target leverage remains at 4 to 4.5 times, and up to 3.5 times at the charter operating level. in 2016, charter purchased approximately 5.1 million shares of its class a common stock for approximately $1.3 billion pursuant to authorizations by charter's board of directors of $3 billion. accordingly, as of december 31, 2016 and provided charter's and charter operating's leverage ratios remain at target, management has authority to cause charter to purchase an additional $1.7 billion of charter's class a common stock without taking into account shares or units that may be purchased from a/n. effective november 1, 2016, charter's board of directors granted authority for a new $750 million of class a common stock buybacks under the rolling six-month authority without taking into account any class a common stock purchased prior to november 1. as a result, a portion of the $1.7 billion of authority is under the authority of management to approve up to $750 million for class a common stock buybacks in any six-month period. charter is not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the timing of any purchases that may occur cannot be predicted and will largely depend on market conditions and other potential uses of capital. purchases may include open market purchases or negotiated transactions. as possible acquisitions, swaps or dispositions arise, we actively review them against our objectives including, among other considerations, improving the operational efficiency, clustering, product development or technology capabilities of our business and achieving appropriate return targets, and we may participate to the extent we believe these possibilities present attractive opportunities. however, there can be no assurance that we will actually complete any acquisitions, dispositions or system swaps, or that any such transactions will be material to our operations or results.
in december 2016, charter and a/n exchanged 1.9 million charter holdings common units held by a/n for shares of charter class a common stock pursuant to the letter agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $537 million. the letter agreement also requires a/n to sell to charter or to charter holdings, on a monthly basis, a number of shares of charter class a common stock or charter holdings common units that represents a pro rata participation by a/n and its affiliates in any repurchases of shares of charter class a common stock from persons other than a/n effected by charter during the immediately preceding calendar month, at a purchase price equal to the average price paid by charter for the shares repurchased from persons other than a/n during such immediately preceding calendar month. pursuant to the letter agreement, charter holdings purchased from a/n 752,767 charter holdings common units at a price per unit of $289.83, or $218 million.
recent events in january 2017, charter operating entered into an amendment to its credit agreement decreasing the applicable libor margin on both the term loan e and term loan f to 2.00% and eliminating the libor floor.
in february 2017, cco holdings and cco holdings capital corp. closed on transactions in which they issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2027. the net proceeds will be used to redeem cco holdings' 6.625% senior notes due 2022, pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.

•   we rent utility poles used in our operations. generally, pole rentals are cancelable on short notice, but we anticipate that such rentals will recur. rent expense incurred for pole rental attachments for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $115 million, $53 million and $49 million, respectively.
•   we pay franchise fees under multi-year franchise agreements based on a percentage of revenues generated from video service per year. we also pay other franchise related costs, such as public education grants, under multi-year agreements. franchise fees and other franchise-related costs included in the accompanying statement of operations were $534 million, $212 million and $208 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
•   we also have $278 million in letters of credit, of which $220 million is secured under the charter operating credit facility, primarily to our various casualty carriers as collateral for reimbursement of workers' compensation, auto liability and general liability claims.
•   minimum pension funding requirements have not been presented in the table above as such amounts have not been determined beyond 2016. we made no cash contributions to the qualified pension plans in 2016; however, we are permitted to make discretionary cash contributions to the qualified pension plans in 2017. for the nonqualified pension plan, we contributed $5 million during 2016 and will continue to make contributions in 2017 to the extent benefits are paid.
see "part i. item 1. business - transaction-related commitments" for a listing of commitments as a result of the transactions.
historical operating, investing, and financing activities cash and cash equivalents. we held $1.5 billion and $5 million in cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we also held $22.3 billion in restricted cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2015 representing proceeds of debt raised to fund the cash portion of the twc transaction consideration that were held in escrow until consummation of the twc transaction.
operating activities.  net cash provided by operating activities increased $5.7 billion during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in adjusted ebitda of $7.2 billion offset by an increase in cash paid for interest, net of $1.6 billion.
net cash provided by operating activities remained flat at $2.4 billion for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014.
investing activities. net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, was $11.3 billion, $17.0 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively. cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily represented the acquisitions of legacy twc and legacy bright house with long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents and an increase in capital expenditures of $3.5 billion as compared to 2015.
the increase in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to an increase in the investment of net proceeds from the issuance of the cco safari ii notes, cco safari iii credit facilities and ccoh safari notes related to the twc transaction in long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents offset by a decrease in long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents upon repayment of the term g loans and ccoh safari notes out of escrow related to the comcast transactions and a decrease in capital expenditures.
financing activities. net cash provided in financing activities was $4.8 billion, $14.7 billion and $6.9 billion for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. cash provided during the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily represented the issuance of $5 billion of equity to liberty broadband to fund a portion of the transactions in 2016 offset by an increase in the purchase of treasury stock of $1.5 billion as compared to 2015.
the increase in cash provided during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2014 was primarily the result of the issuance of the cco safari ii notes, cco safari iii credit facilities and ccoh safari notes related to the twc transaction offset by the repayment of $7.1 billion of net proceeds held in escrow related to the ccoh safari notes and term g loans upon the termination of the comcast transactions.
capital expenditures we have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements.  capital expenditures were $5.3 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  the increase was driven by the transactions. on a pro forma basis, assuming the transactions occurred as of january 1, 2015, the increase for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared
54
to the corresponding prior period was driven by higher product development investments, transition capital expenditures incurred in connection with the transactions and support capital investments. see the table below for more details.
the actual amount of our capital expenditures in 2017 will depend on a number of factors, including the pace of transition planning to service a larger customer base as a result of the transactions, our all-digital transition in the legacy twc and legacy bright house markets and growth rates of both our residential and commercial businesses.
our capital expenditures are funded primarily from cash flows from operating activities and borrowings on our credit facility. in addition, our liabilities related to capital expenditures increased by $603 million, $28 million and $33 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the following tables present our major capital expenditures categories on an actual and pro forma basis, assuming the transactions occurred as of january 1, 2015, in accordance with national cable and telecommunications association ("ncta") disclosure guidelines for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. the disclosure is intended to provide more consistency in the reporting of capital expenditures among peer companies in the cable industry. these disclosure guidelines are not required disclosures under gaap, nor do they impact our accounting for capital expenditures under gaap (dollars in millions):

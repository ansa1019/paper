item 1a. risk factors.
in addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. the risks described below are not the only risks we face. additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.
international operations, currency rate fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations and geopolitical uncertainty our products are produced and sold in numerous countries throughout the world, we have employees in various countries throughout the world and we have production facilities currently in the u.s., mexico, new zealand, italy and canada.
risks associated with international operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, include:
•   changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions;
•   potential disruption from socio-economic violence, including terrorism and drug-related violence;
•   restrictions on foreign ownership and investments or on repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the u.s.;
•   changes in laws, governmental regulations and policies in the u.s. and in many countries outside the u.s., including changes in tax laws and regulations;
•   import and export requirements;
•   currency exchange rate fluctuations;
•   a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment in some countries, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues;
•   laws regarding the enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights;
10
•   inadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the foreign corrupt practices act; and
•   other challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences.
our success will depend, in part, on our ability to overcome the challenges we encounter with respect to these factors and other matters generally affecting u.s. companies with international operations. although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including anti-corruption and privacy laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies or take action determined to be in violation of the law. any determination that our operations or activities did not comply with applicable u.s. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, interruptions of business, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal and equitable sanctions.
we are also exposed to risks associated with currency fluctuations and risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. currency exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies in the markets in which we do business have fluctuated in recent years and are likely to continue to do so in the future. we manage our exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risks utilizing derivative instruments and other means to reduce those risks. we could experience changes in our ability to hedge against or manage fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks. we could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations, unstable governments, unfamiliar or biased legal systems or intergovernmental disputes. these currency, economic and political uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions, policies or economic strength of our suppliers and distributors, affect our international operations.
competition we are in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our sales could be negatively affected by numerous factors including:
•   our inability to maintain or increase prices, particularly in our beer business;
•   new entrants in our market or categories;
•   a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption; or
•   the decision of wholesalers, retailers or consumers to purchase a competitor's product instead of ours.
unit volume and dollar amount of sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state and provincial agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, our products. we could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons.
worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions we are subject to risks associated with adverse economic conditions, including economic slowdown, inflation, and the disruption, volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets. unfavorable global or regional economic conditions could adversely impact our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. unemployment, tax increases, governmental spending cuts or a return of high levels of inflation could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products. these could also create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers, distributors, retailers and consumers. the inability of suppliers, distributors and retailers to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products. we have a committed credit facility and additional liquidity facilities available to us. while to date we have not experienced problems with accessing these facilities, to the extent that the financial institutions that participate in these facilities were to default on their obligation to fund, those funds would not be available to us.
11
dependence on sales of our mexican beer brands sales of our mexican beer brands in the u.s. are a significant portion of our business. accordingly, a decline in the growth rate, amount or profitability of our sales of the mexican beer brands in the u.s. could adversely affect our business. further, consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from the mexican beer brands, the categories in which they compete, or beer generally due to, among other reasons, changing taste preferences, demographics or perceived value. consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences and taste away from the mexican beer brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition and results of operations.
supply of mexican beer brands in order to fulfill our current and projected mexican beer brands product requirements, we are currently dependent on our nava brewery located in nava, coahuila, mexico and our obregon brewery located in obregon, sonora, mexico. although we are in the process of optimizing our obregon brewery and constructing an additional brewery in mexicali, baja california, mexico, our nava brewery and our obregon brewery are currently our sole source of supply for our mexican beer brands. the nava brewery currently has the capacity to fill approximately 80% of our current product requirements with the balance able to be filled by our obregon brewery.
our supply of mexican beer brands is also dependent upon an adequate supply of glass bottles. we formed the mexican glass plant joint venture which acquired and is expanding the glass plant adjacent to our nava brewery in order to increase bottle output to support increased production at our nava brewery.
we may not be able to satisfy all of our product supply requirements for the mexican beer brands in the event of a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the nava brewery or the obregon brewery. also, if the contemplated nava brewery and glass plant expansions, obregon brewery optimization and mexicali brewery construction activities are not completed by their targeted completion dates, we may not be able to produce sufficient mexican beer brands to satisfy our needs. under such circumstances, we may be unable to obtain mexican beer brands at a reasonable price from another source, if at all. a significant disruption at our nava brewery or our obregon brewery, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to market on a timely basis. alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, any of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. similarly, although we have additional sources of supply of glass bottles, a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the mexican glass plant or the failure of the joint venture to complete the glass plant expansion could impair our ability to bottle and ship our mexican beer products to market. additionally, our general insurance policies may not cover certain types of catastrophes that might affect our supply of the mexican beer brands. a major uninsured catastrophe could result in significant unrecoverable losses.
expansion issues, construction issues and operational disruptions we are currently expanding our nava brewery, optimizing our obregon brewery and constructing our mexicali brewery and our joint venture with owens-illinois is expanding the glass plant. while these multi-million dollar expansion and construction activities are progressing consistent with our plans, there is always the potential risk of completion delays and cost overruns.
expansion and optimization of current production facilities and construction of new production facilities are subject to various regulatory and developmental risks, including but not limited to: (i)  our ability to obtain timely certificate authorizations, necessary approvals and permits from regulatory agencies and on terms that are acceptable to us; (ii)  potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; (iii)  inability to acquire rights-of-way or land or water rights on a timely basis on terms that are acceptable to us; and (iv)  inability to acquire the necessary energy supplies, including electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel. any of these events could delay the expansion, construction or optimization of our production facilities.
12
many of our production facilities, such as our breweries, wineries, distilleries and the glass plant are asset intensive. our profitability could be affected by operational disruption of any of our production or bottling lines or the glass furnace. in such event we may experience an adverse effect to our business operations and profitability due to higher maintenance charges, unexpected capital spending or product supply constraints.
supply of quality water, agricultural and other raw materials, certain raw materials and packaging materials purchased under short-term supply contracts, limited group of suppliers of glass bottles the quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business. water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe, there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints. we are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries, our wineries and our distilleries, as well as to irrigate our vineyards and conduct our other operations. the suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fields.
we have substantial wine operations in the state of california. although certain areas in california have recently experienced flooding, the state had endured an extended period of drought and instituted restrictions on water usage. while we have undertaken a number of water saving initiatives and we currently believe we have sufficient water available for our california vineyards and wineries, a recurrence of severe drought conditions in california could have an adverse effect upon those operations, which effect could become more significant depending upon actual future drought conditions. our nava brewery and the glass plant receive water originating from a mountain aquifer. our obregon brewery receives its allocation of water originating from an aquifer and we expect our mexicali brewery will receive an allocation of water originating from an aquifer. although we anticipate our breweries and the glass plant will receive water adequate to support their on-going requirements, including as a result of the anticipated optimization and expansions, there is no guarantee that the water available to them, our expectations as to the source of water, methods of water delivery, or their water requirements will not change materially in the future.
growing agricultural raw materials also requires adequate water supplies. if water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarcer or the quality of that water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. even if quality water is widely available, including to our breweries, our wineries, our distilleries and our vineyards, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards. a substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply. any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
our breweries, the glass plant, our wineries and our distilleries also use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products. as to the nava brewery and the obregon brewery, these include corn starch, malt, hops and water; the glass plant uses large amounts of soda ash and silica sand; the ballast point breweries use large amounts of malt, hops, yeast and water, as well as corn sugars, spices and fruits; the wineries use large amounts of grapes and water; and the distilleries use large amounts of grain and water. our breweries, our wineries and our distilleries all use large amounts of various packaging materials, including glass, aluminum, cardboard and other paper products. our production facilities, including the glass plant, also use a significant amount of energy in their operations, including electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel. certain raw materials and packaging materials are purchased under contracts of varying maturities. the supply and price of raw materials, packaging materials and energy can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices), droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases and theft. to the extent any of the foregoing factors, including supply of goods and energy, affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or we do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks, or are unable to recoup costs through increases in the price of our finished products, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.
13
glass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold. we currently have a small number of suppliers of glass bottles for our mexican beer brands. in the u.s., glass bottles have only a small number of producers. currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our u.s. wine and spirits operations and a different supplier supplies our glass bottles for our craft beer. the inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our business.
catastrophic loss to wineries, production facilities or distribution systems throughout the years, we have consolidated several of our winery and production facility operations. approximately 80% of our total annual wine and spirits product volume is produced in the u.s., and three of our largest wineries are the woodbridge winery in acampo, ca, the canandaigua winery in canandaigua, ny, and the mission bell winery in madera, ca. these three facilities produce approximately 40.6 million cases (or approximately 75% of our u.s. production) which is approximately 60% of the total annual constellation wine and spirits product volume globally. currently, our entire mexican beer brands product supply is produced at our breweries in nava, coahuila, mexico and obregon, sonora, mexico.
additionally, many of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities, such as our california wineries, our lodi distribution center in lodi, ca, certain of our ballast point operations, and our planned mexicali brewery are located in areas which are prone to seismic activity. if any of these vineyards and facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace the vineyard or facility. if such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. in addition, since we have consolidated certain of our operations and various production and distribution facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption of our operations in the event of a catastrophic event in any one location, such as through acts of war or terrorism, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural or man-made disasters. although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, certain catastrophes are not covered by our insurance policies as we believe this to be a prudent financial decision. economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain insurance. if our insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our financial results. we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by a catastrophic event, but there is no certainty that our efforts would prove successful. if one or more significant uninsured events occur, we could suffer a major financial loss.
changes to international trade agreements and tariffs, changes to accounting standards, elections or assertions, changes to tax laws, changes to import and excise duties or other taxes or other governmental rules and regulations, including significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations in the marketing or sale of our products, and accounting for tax positions and the resolution of tax disputes the u.s. and other countries in which we operate impose import and excise duties, tariffs, and other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which are subject to change. significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on beverage alcohol products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. the u.s. federal budget and individual state, provincial or local municipal budget deficits could result in increased taxes on our products, business, customers or consumers. various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state or provincial level in recent years. many u.s. states have considered proposals to increase, and some of these states have increased, state alcohol excise taxes. there may be further consideration by federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental entities to increase taxes upon beverage alcohol products as governmental entities explore available alternatives for raising funds during the current macroeconomic climate.
comments made during the course of the 2016 u.s. presidential campaign and subsequent to the election indicate that the u.s. federal government may propose changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations. the current u.s. administration has indicated that tax reform is among its top priorities and the u.s. congress is reviewing and may, in the future, review tax legislation proposals. while we
14
cannot predict what changes will actually occur with respect to any of these items, such changes could affect our business and results of operations.
in addition, federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing, warehousing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers. certain federal, state or provincial regulations also require warning labels and signage. new or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. additionally, various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health effects. if these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our major products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.
we may also make various accounting elections or assertions or change accounting elections or assertions that we have previously made. our accounting elections or assertions or changes to our accounting elections or assertions are affected by various business factors which, collectively, may have an impact on our financial results or our effective tax rate.
additionally, significant judgment is required to determine our effective tax rate and evaluate our tax positions. we provide for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable accounting standards. fluctuations in federal, state, local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results. when tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.
indebtedness in recent years, we have incurred substantial indebtedness to finance acquisitions such as our acquisition of ballast point, the prisoner wine company brand portfolio, the charles smith wines collection, high west, and the obregon brewery, fund the beer business acquisition, expand our nava brewery and begin construction of our mexicali brewery, expand the glass plant, and repurchase shares of our common stock. in the future, we may continue to incur substantial additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions, repurchase shares of our stock and fund other general corporate purposes, including the nava brewery and glass plant expansions, obregon brewery optimization and mexicali brewery construction. we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all our debt service requirements, to pay dividends, to repurchase shares of our common stock, and to fund our general corporate and capital requirements.
our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance. we do not have complete control over our future operating performance because it is subject to prevailing economic conditions, levels of interest rates and financial, business and other factors.
our current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences. these consequences include, or may include, the following:
•   our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;
•   our funds available for operations, expansions, dividends or other distributions, or stock repurchases may be reduced because we dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;
•   our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and
•   our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.
15
restrictive covenants in our senior credit facility and in our indentures place limits on our ability to conduct our business. covenants in our senior credit facility include those that restrict our ability to make acquisitions, incur debt, encumber or sell assets, pay dividends, engage in mergers and consolidations, enter into transactions with affiliates, make investments and permit our subsidiaries to enter into certain restrictive agreements. it additionally contains certain financial covenants, including a net debt coverage ratio test and an interest coverage ratio test. covenants in our indentures are generally less restrictive than those in our senior credit facility but nevertheless, among other things, limit our ability under certain circumstances to create liens or enter into sale-leaseback transactions and impose conditions on our ability to engage in mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.
these agreements also contain certain change of control provisions which, if triggered, may result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the debt. if we fail to comply with the obligations contained in the senior credit facility, our existing or future indentures or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such agreements, which could require us to immediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.
potential decline in the consumption of products we sell we rely on consumers' demand for our products. consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic or social trends, public health policies, and changes in leisure, dining and beverage consumption patterns. our continued success will require us to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behavior and drinking tastes. if consumer preferences were to move away from our premium brands, including our mexican beer brands, in any of our major markets, our financial results might be adversely affected.
while over the past several years there have been modest increases in the overall consumption of beverage alcohol and fluctuations in per capita consumption within categories of beverage alcohol, there have been periods in the past in which there were sequential declines in the overall per capita consumption of certain beverage alcohol product categories in the u.s. and other markets in which we participate. a limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including:
•   a general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions;
•   concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving;
•   a general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premise establishments, such as may result from smoking bans and stricter laws relating to driving while under the influence of alcohol;
•   a decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products as a result of consumers substituting legalized marijuana or other similar products in lieu of our products;
•   consumer dietary preferences favoring lighter, lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks, sports drinks and water products;
•   the increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;
•   increased federal, state, provincial and foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing;
•   increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products or increasing prices due to the imposition of duties or excise tax or changes to international trade agreements or tariffs;
•   inflation; and
•   wars, pandemics, weather and natural or man-made disasters.
in addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products. the launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain especially with regard to their appeal to consumers. the launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation. unsuccessful implementation or short-lived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory write-offs and other costs.
16
acquisition, divestiture and joint venture strategy we have made a number of acquisitions and divestitures and may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business. recently, these have included the meiomi wine brand, the ballast point craft beer business, the prisoner wine company brand portfolio, the charles smith wines collection, high west, and the obregon brewery, as well as various minority investments by our constellation ventures function. we will need to integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations; our overall internal control over financial reporting processes; and our financial, operations and information systems. if the financial performance of our business, as supplemented by the assets and businesses acquired, does not meet our expectations, it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectations. we may also divest ourselves of businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business. for example, we recently sold our canadian wine business. we may be obligated to provide certain services on a transitional basis to divested operations. we cannot assure you that we will realize the expected benefits of divestitures.
we cannot assure you that we will realize the expected benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, such as revenue, earnings or operating efficiency, and we may not effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframes. complications with on-going integration of any acquisition or joint venture, including our obregon brewery acquisition or the glass plant joint venture, could result from the following circumstances, among others:
•   failure to implement our business plan for the combined business;
•   unanticipated issues in integrating, migrating or changing manufacturing, logistics, information, communications, financial, internal control and other systems;
•   failure to retain key customers and suppliers;
•   unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;
•   failure to retain key employees;
•   operating risks inherent in the acquired businesses and assets and our business;
•   dependency upon the operational experience of employees who are relatively new to our organization;
•   unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities;
•   failure to realize fully anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities and other potential synergies; and
•   unfamiliarity with operating new locations.
our joint venture to operate a glass plant adjacent to our nava brewery is fully consolidated into our financial results and the entire output of that facility is being utilized to support our mexican beer business and the production at our nava brewery. the integration of the mexican glass plant can be further impacted by the following circumstances:
•   we share control of the joint venture with owens-illinois and while owens-illinois has deep experience running glass plants, we are not as experienced in that particular business; and
•   the ability of the joint venture to expand the glass plant capacity as planned in order to support the future growth of our beer business.
if any of these circumstances were to occur with respect to any of our acquisitions, including our beer business acquisition or the joint venture's acquisition of the glass plant, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.
we may provide various indemnifications in connection with the sale of assets or portions of our business. additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. we cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.
we have entered into various joint ventures and we may enter into additional joint ventures for other purposes and with other parties. we share control of our joint ventures. we have also acquired or retained
17
ownership interests in companies which we do not control, such as investments recently made through our constellation ventures function, such as our minority interests in nelson's green brier tennessee whiskey, the bardstown bourbon company, catoctin creek distilling company, and crafthouse cocktails. our joint venture partners or the other parties that hold the remaining ownership interests in companies which we do not control may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint ventures or those companies. our joint venture arrangements and the arrangements through which we acquired or hold our other equity or membership interests may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs, to make capital investments, to fulfill alone our joint venture partners' obligations, or to purchase other parties' interests. even though we share control of our glass plant joint venture, that joint venture's financial results are consolidated into our financial results. our failure to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisition, or the failure of an entity in which we have an equity or membership interest, could adversely affect our financial condition or our valuation of these types of investments.
we cannot assure you that any of our acquisitions, investments or joint ventures will be profitable or that forecasts regarding acquisition, divestiture, joint venture or investment activities will be accurate.
reliance on wholesale distributors, major retailers and government agencies local market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide. within our primary market in the u.s., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, craft beer, branded wine and spirits categories, with separate distribution networks utilized for our imported and craft beer portfolios and our wine and spirits portfolio. in the u.s., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores, club and discount stores, package liquor stores and restaurants and also directly to government agencies and we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our u.s. wine and spirits sales. the replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could result in temporary or longer-term sales disruptions or could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for a particular period. our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale and retail distribution channels, particularly in the u.s. if we are unable to adapt successfully to this changing environment, our net income, market share and volume growth could be negatively affected. in addition, wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space, promotional support and consumer purchases. accordingly, wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors.
reliance upon complex information systems and third party global networks we depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers, as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach. we recognize that many groups on a world-wide basis have experienced increases in cyber attacks and other hacking activity. we have dedicated internal and external resources to review and address such threats. however, as with all large information technology systems, our systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting our information, disrupting our business processes, or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic information about us or our employees, customers or consumers. such unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation, or the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event. such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we have outsourced various functions to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future. we rely on those third-party service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis. although we believe we have robust service level agreements with such third parties, closely monitor their
18
performance and maintain contingency plans in case they are unable to perform as agreed, we do not ultimately control their performance. their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow, and could impair our ability to make required filings with various reporting agencies on a timely or accurate basis.
damage to our reputation maintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our branded products. product contamination or tampering or the failure to maintain our standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including with respect to raw materials, naturally occurring compounds, packaging materials or product components obtained from suppliers, may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. although we maintain standards for the materials and product components we receive from our suppliers, and we also audit our suppliers' compliance with our standards, it is possible that a supplier may not provide materials or product components which meet our required standards or may falsify documentation associated with the fulfillment of those requirements. if any of our products becomes unsafe or unfit for consumption, is misbranded or causes injury, we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability and incur additional costs. a widespread product recall, multiple product recalls, or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity. our reputation could be impacted negatively by public perception, adverse publicity (whether or not valid), negative comments in social media, or our responses relating to:
•   a perceived failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities;
•   a perceived failure to address concerns relating to the quality, safety or integrity of our products;
•   our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, water and energy use, and waste management; or
•   effects that are perceived as insufficient to promote the responsible use of alcohol.
failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls, to provide accurate and timely financial statement information, or to protect our information systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, could also hurt our reputation. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation, competitive position and brand equity.
contamination the success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of those brands. contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could adversely affect their sales. contaminants in raw materials, packaging materials or product components purchased from third parties and used in the production of our beer, wine or spirits products or defects in the fermentation or distillation process could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and may result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands.
dependence upon trademarks and proprietary rights, failure to protect our intellectual property rights our future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. we have been granted numerous trademark registrations covering our brands and products and have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications seeking to protect newly-developed brands and products. we cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of our trademark applications. there is also a risk that we could, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark or that our competitors will challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us.
19
intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks we continue to have a significant amount of intangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and may acquire more intangible assets in the future. intangible assets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation under applicable accounting standards. the write-down of any of these intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our net income.
climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change our business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources. there has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. severe weather events, such as drought or flooding in california or a prolonged cold winter in new york, and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our various agricultural raw materials. decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products. severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain, which may affect production operations, insurance cost and coverage, as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers, retailers and consumers.
various diseases, pests and certain weather conditions various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of barley, hops, grapes and other agricultural raw materials available, decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability. we cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers or our suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed in preventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire. future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in growing grapes or other agricultural raw materials may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production of grapes or other crops.
cost of energy or environmental regulatory compliance we have experienced increases in energy costs in the past, and energy costs could rise in the future, which would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs. we may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance, including fees, licenses, and the cost of capital improvements to our operating facilities in order to meet environmental regulatory requirements. our future operating expenses and margins will be dependent on our ability to manage the impact of cost increases. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass along increased energy costs or increased costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance to our customers through increased prices.
in addition, we may be party to various environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of our business or in connection with historical activities of businesses we acquire. due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants in our current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs that we have estimated. we may incur cost associated with environmental compliance arising from events we cannot control, such as unusually severe floods, hurricanes or earthquakes. we cannot assure you that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our projections or otherwise have an adverse effect upon our business reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
control by the sands family our class b common stock is principally held by members of the sands family, either directly or through entities controlled by members of the sands family. holders of class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of class b common stock are entitled to 10 votes per share. holders of class 1 common stock generally do not have voting rights. the stock ownership of the sands family and entities controlled by members of
20
the sands family represents a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our common stock as of april 21, 2017, voting as a single class. consequently, the sands family has the power to elect a majority of our directors and approve actions requiring the approval of the stockholders of the company voting as a single class.
benefit cost increases and labor relations our profitability is affected by employee medical costs and other employee benefits. in recent years, employee medical costs have increased due to factors such as the increase in health care costs in the u.s. these factors are expected to continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance due to higher employee benefit costs. although we actively seek to control increases in employee benefit costs and encourage employees to maintain healthy lifestyles to reduce future potential medical costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases. continued employee benefit cost increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we believe our subsidiaries have good working relations with their employees. however, if their employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, they could experience an operational disruption and/or experience higher on-going labor costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
class action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse, the misuse of alcohol, product liability, or marketing or sales practices there has been public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which we believe is due to concern over problems related to harmful use of alcohol, including drinking and driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. we also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices. adverse developments in lawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that may result from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
introduction this md&a, which should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, provides additional information on our businesses, current developments, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. it is organized as follows:
•   overview. this section provides a general description of our business, which we believe is important in understanding the results of our operations, financial condition and potential future trends.
•   strategy. this section provides a description of our strategy and a discussion of acquisitions and divestitures.
•   results of operations. this section provides an analysis of our results of operations presented on a business segment basis. in addition, a brief description of transactions and other items that affect the comparability of the results is provided.
•   financial liquidity and capital resources. this section provides an analysis of our cash flows and our outstanding debt and commitments. included in the analysis of outstanding debt is a discussion of the amount of financial capacity available to fund our ongoing operations and future commitments, as well as a discussion of other financing arrangements.
•   critical accounting estimates. this section identifies those accounting policies that are considered important to our results of operations and financial condition, require significant judgment and involve significant management estimates. our significant accounting policies, including those considered to be critical accounting policies, are summarized in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements.
overview we are an international beverage alcohol company with a broad portfolio of consumer-preferred high-end imported and craft beer brands, and premium wine and spirits brands. we are the third-largest producer and marketer of beer for the u.s. market and the world's leading premium wine company. we are the largest multi-category supplier (beer, wine and spirits) of beverage alcohol in the u.s., and a leading supplier of wine from new zealand and italy to north america.
our internal management financial reporting consists of two business divisions:  (i)  beer and (ii)  wine and spirits, and we report our operating results in three segments:  (i)  beer, (ii)  wine and spirits, and (iii)  corporate operations and other. in the beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported and craft beer brands. we have an exclusive perpetual brand license to import, market and sell in the u.s. our mexican beer portfolio. in the wine and spirits segment, we sell a large number of wine brands across all categories - table wine, sparkling wine and dessert wine - and across all price points - popular, premium and luxury categories, primarily within the $5 to $25 price range at u.s. retail - complemented by certain premium spirits brands. amounts included in the corporate operations and other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development,
27
corporate finance, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations and information technology. the amounts included in the corporate operations and other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are therefore not allocated to the other reportable segments. all costs reported within the corporate operations and other segment are not included in our chief operating decision maker's evaluation of the operating income performance of the other reportable segments. the business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management and the structure of our internal financial reporting.
strategy our overall strategy is to sustain profitable growth and build shareholder value. we position our portfolio to benefit from industry premiumization trends, which we believe will continue to result in faster growth rates in the high-end of the beer, wine and spirits categories. we focus on developing our expertise in consumer insights and category management as well as our strong distributor network, which provides an effective route-to-market. additionally, we leverage our scale across the total beverage alcohol market and our level of diversification hedges our portfolio risk. in addition to growing our existing business, we seek targeted acquisitions of businesses that are premium, growing, high-margin, consumer-led, have a low integration risk and/or fill a gap in our portfolio.
we strive to strengthen our portfolio of premium beer, wine and spirits brands and differentiate ourselves through:
•   leveraging our leading position in total beverage alcohol and our scale with wholesalers and retailers to expand distribution of our product portfolio and cross promotional opportunities;
•   strengthening relationships with wholesalers and retailers by providing consumer and beverage alcohol insights;
•   investing in brand building activities;
•   positioning ourselves for success with consumer-led innovation capabilities;
•   realizing operating efficiencies through expanding and enhancing production capabilities and maximizing asset utilization; and
•   developing employees to enhance performance in the marketplace.
our business strategy in the beer segment focuses on leading the high-end of the u.s. beer market and includes continued focus on growing our beer portfolio in the u.s. through expanding distribution for key brands, as well as new product development and innovation within the existing portfolio of brands, and continued construction, expansion and optimization activities for our mexico beer operations.
in connection with this strategy, we have expanded our nava brewery from 10 million to 25 million hectoliters production capacity since the acquisition of the nava brewery. expansion, construction and optimization efforts continue under our mexico beer expansion projects to align with our anticipated future growth expectations. see "capital expenditures" below for additional discussion.
our business strategy in the wine and spirits segment is to be the leader in the premium wine category and build a portfolio of premium spirits brands. we are investing to meet the evolving needs of consumers and building brands through consumer insights, sensory expertise, innovation and refreshing existing brands. in this segment, we continue to focus on the premiumization of our branded wine and spirits portfolio. we dedicate a large share of our sales and marketing resources to our u.s. focus brands as they represent a majority of our u.s. wine and spirits revenue and profitability, and generally have strong positions in their respective price categories. in markets where it is feasible, we have a consolidated u.s. distribution network in order to obtain dedicated distributor selling resources which focus on our u.s. wine and spirits portfolio to drive organic growth. this consolidated u.s. distribution network currently represents about 70% of our branded wine and spirits volume in the u.s. throughout the terms of these contracts, we generally expect shipments on an annual basis to these distributors to essentially equal the distributors' shipments to retailers.
28
marketing, sales and distribution of our products are managed on a geographic basis in order to fully leverage leading market positions. in addition, market dynamics and consumer trends vary across each of our markets. within our primary market in the u.s., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, craft beer, branded wine and spirits categories, with separate distribution networks utilized for (i)  our beer portfolio and (ii)  our wine and spirits portfolio. the environment for our products is competitive in each of our markets.
we remain committed to our long-term financial model of growing sales, expanding margins and increasing cash flow in order to achieve earnings per share growth, reduce borrowings and pay quarterly cash dividends.
acquisitions and divestitures beer segment obregon brewery in december 2016, we acquired the obregon brewery for cash paid of $568.7 million, net of cash acquired, subject to estimated working capital adjustments due to seller of $3.1 million. the transaction primarily included the acquisition of operations; goodwill; property, plant and equipment; and inventories. this acquisition provided us with immediate functioning brewery capacity to support our fast-growing, high-end mexican beer portfolio and flexibility for future innovation initiatives. it also enabled us to become fully independent from an interim supply agreement with modelo, which was terminated at the time of this acquisition. the results of operations of the obregon brewery are reported in the beer segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
ballast point acquisition in december 2015, we acquired ballast point for $998.5 million, net of cash acquired. the transaction primarily included the acquisition of operations, goodwill, trademarks and property, plant and equipment. this acquisition provided us with a high-growth premium platform that enables us to compete in the growing, emerging national craft beer category and further strengthened our position in the high-end u.s. beer market. the results of operations of ballast point are reported in the beer segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
wine and spirits segment canadian divestiture in december 2016, we sold our canadian wine business, which included canadian wine brands such as jackson-triggs and inniskillin, wineries, vineyards, offices, facilities and wine rack retail stores, at a transaction value of c$1.03 billion, or $775.2 million. accordingly, our consolidated results of operations include the results of operations of our canadian wine business through the date of divestiture. we received cash proceeds of $575.3 million, net of outstanding debt and direct costs to sell, subject to working capital adjustments. we will continue to export certain of our brands into the canadian market, which remains our largest export market. this transaction is consistent with our strategic focus on premium, high-margin and high-growth brands. we recognized a net gain on the sale of the business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 of $262.4 million. additionally, our current estimate of the income taxes we expect to pay is approximately $77 million in total during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 in connection with the canadian divestiture.

additionally, the impact on our historical wine and spirits segment results are the same as the impact on the historical consolidated results for net sales, gross profit, and depreciation and amortization. however, as segment results do not include the impact of comparable adjustments, amounts reported for our historical wine and spirits segment operating income that will no longer be part of the segment's results after the canadian divestiture are $50.1 million and $63.3 million for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.
high west acquisition in october 2016, we acquired high west, which primarily included the acquisition of operations, goodwill, trademarks, inventories and property, plant and equipment. this acquisition included a portfolio of distinctive, award-winning, fast-growing and high-end craft whiskeys and other select spirits. the results of operations of high west are reported in the wine and spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
charles smith acquisition in october 2016, we acquired charles smith, which primarily included the acquisition of goodwill, trademarks, inventories and certain grape supply contracts. this acquisition included a collection of five super and ultra-premium wine brands and solidified our position as the second leading supplier of washington state wines with this collection of fast-growing, high quality wines that have strong consumer affinity and demand. the results of operations of charles smith are reported in the wine and spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
prisoner acquisition in april 2016, we acquired prisoner, which primarily included the acquisition of goodwill, inventories, trademarks and certain grape supply contracts. this acquisition, which included a portfolio of five fast-growing, higher-margin, super-luxury wine brands, aligned with our portfolio premiumization strategy and strengthened our position in the super-luxury wine category. the results of operations of prisoner are reported in the wine and spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
meiomi acquisition in august 2015, we acquired meiomi, which primarily included the acquisition of goodwill, inventories, the trademark and certain grape supply contracts. the acquisition of this higher-margin, luxury growth brand has complemented our existing portfolio and further strengthened our position in the u.s. pinot noir category. the results of operations of meiomi are reported in the wine and spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
for additional information on these acquisitions, refer to note 2 of the notes to the financial statements.

results of operations financial highlights references to organic throughout the following discussion exclude the impact of acquired brand activity in connection with the acquisitions of meiomi, prisoner, high west and charles smith (wine and spirits), and the acquisition of ballast point (beer), and divested brand activity in connection with the canadian divestiture, as appropriate.
financial highlights for fiscal 2017:
•   our results of operations benefited from improvements in both the beer and wine and spirits segments.
•   net sales increased 12% primarily due to strong consumer demand across both segments and net sales from the acquired ballast point, meiomi and prisoner brands.
•   operating income increased 36% primarily due to a gain on sale of business recognized in connection with the canadian divestiture, the strong consumer demand and the benefits from the acquired brands.
•   net income attributable to cbi and diluted net income per common share attributable to cbi increased 46% and 45%, respectively, primarily due to the items discussed above and an income tax benefit driven largely by a change in our assertion regarding the indefinite reinvestment of certain foreign earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
comparable adjustments management excludes items that affect comparability from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these comparable adjustments are not reflective of core operations of the segments. segment operating performance and segment management compensation are evaluated based on core segment operating income (loss). as such, the performance measures for incentive compensation purposes for segment management do not include the impact of these comparable adjustments.
as more fully described herein and in the related notes to the financial statements, the comparable adjustments that impacted comparability in our results for each period are as follows:

cost of product sold undesignated commodity derivative contracts net gain (loss) on undesignated commodity derivative contracts represents a net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of undesignated commodity derivative contracts. the net gain (loss) is reported outside of segment operating results until such time that the underlying exposure is recognized in the segment operating results. at settlement, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the undesignated commodity derivative contracts is reported in the appropriate operating segment, allowing the results of our operating segments to reflect the economic effects of the commodity derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.
inventory step-up in connection with acquisitions, the allocation of purchase price in excess of book value for certain inventories on hand at the date of acquisition is referred to as inventory step-up. inventory step-up represents an assumed manufacturing profit attributable to the acquired business prior to acquisition. flow through of inventory step-up was primarily associated with the prisoner acquisition (fiscal 2017) and meiomi acquisition (fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016).
favorable interim supply agreement in connection with the beer business acquisition, a temporary supply agreement was negotiated under a favorable pricing arrangement for the required volume of beer needed to fulfill expected u.s. demand in excess of the nava brewery's capacity. amortization of favorable interim supply agreement reflects amounts associated with non-nava brewery product purchased from the date of acquisition which has been sold to our u.s. customers during the respective period.
selling, general and administrative expenses impairment of intangible assets in connection with our continued focus on the premiumization of our branded wine and spirits portfolio, a decision was made to discontinue certain small-scale, low-margin u.s. brands within our wine and spirits' portfolio. as a result, trademarks with a carrying value of $37.6 million were written down to their estimated fair value, resulting in an impairment of $37.6 million. in addition, see "costs associated with the canadian
32
divestiture and related activities" below for information about an additional impairment of intangible assets recognized in connection with the canadian divestiture.
costs associated with the canadian divestiture and related activities costs associated with the canadian divestiture and related activities represent costs incurred in connection with the evaluation of the merits of executing an initial public offering for a portion of our canadian wine business and net other costs incurred in connection with the sale of the canadian wine business.
in addition, in connection with the canadian divestiture, trademarks with a carrying value of $8.4 million were written down to their estimated fair value, resulting in an impairment of $8.4 million. these trademarks were associated with certain u.s. brands within our wine and spirits' portfolio sold exclusively through the canadian wine business, for which we expect future sales of these brands to be minimal subsequent to the canadian divestiture.
transaction, integration and other acquisition-related costs transaction, integration and other acquisition-related costs consist of costs associated with our acquisitions.
restructuring and related charges restructuring and related charges consist primarily of employee termination benefit costs recognized in connection with our plan initiated in may 2015 to streamline and simplify processes, and shift resources and investment to long-term, profitable growth opportunities across the business.
other gains (losses)
other gains (losses) consist primarily of a gain from an adjustment to a certain guarantee originally recorded in connection with a prior divestiture (fiscal 2015) and a net gain on the sale of and the write-down of certain property, plant and equipment (fiscal 2015).
gain on sale of business gain on sale of business consists of the net gain recognized in connection with the canadian divestiture.
earnings (losses) from unconsolidated investments earnings (losses) from unconsolidated investments consist primarily of dividend income from a retained interest in a previously divested business (fiscal 2016).

nm = not meaningful gross profit increased $587.1 million primarily due to increases in beer of $375.3 million and wine and spirits of $125.7 million. in addition, the change in comparable adjustments resulted in an increase in gross profit of $86.1 million.
the increase in beer is primarily due to (i)  the volume growth and the favorable impact from pricing in select markets within our mexican beer portfolio of $192.9 million and $92.2 million, respectively; (ii)  gross profit from the acquired ballast point brand of $53.4 million and (iii)  lower cost of product sold for our mexican beer business of $41.7 million. the lower cost of product sold is primarily due to foreign currency transactional benefits within our mexican beer portfolio of $54.6 million and brewery sourcing benefits of $35.3 million, partially offset by higher depreciation expense of $46.9 million.
the increase in wine and spirits is primarily due to gross profit from the acquired brands of $69.4 million and growth from the organic wine and spirits business driven primarily by branded wine and spirits volume growth and favorable product mix shift of $48.8 million and $33.1 million, respectively; partially offset by a decrease in gross profit due to the canadian divestiture of $27.2 million.
gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 48.1% for fiscal 2017 compared with 44.9% for fiscal 2016 primarily due to (i)  a favorable impact from the change in comparable adjustments of approximately 120

selling, general and administrative expenses increased $215.2 million due to increases in beer of $105.0 million, wine and spirits of $51.9 million, comparable adjustments of $43.9 million and corporate operations and other of $14.4 million.
the increase in beer is due to increases in marketing spend of $58.8 million and general and administrative expenses of $46.2 million. the increase in marketing spend is due largely to planned investment to support the growth of our mexican beer portfolio. the increase in general and administrative expenses is predominantly driven by higher compensation and benefits supporting the organic growth of the business of $22.2 million and general and administrative expenses associated with the acquired ballast point business of $19.7 million.
the increase in wine and spirits is primarily due to an increase in marketing spend of $25.7 million and general and administrative expenses of $25.0 million. the increase in marketing spend is due largely to planned investment to support the growth of our branded wine and spirits portfolio. the increase in general and administrative expenses is predominantly driven by (i)  higher compensation and benefits of $24.5 million and higher consulting expenses supporting the growth of the business and (ii)  an unfavorable overlap of prior year foreign currency transaction gains with current year foreign currency transaction losses, partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses due to the canadian divestiture of $16.4 million.
the increase in corporate operations and other is due to higher general and administrative expenses primarily attributable to (i)  higher consulting and information technology expenses, (ii)  higher travel and entertainment expenses and (iii)  an unfavorable overlap of prior year foreign currency transaction gains with current year foreign currency transaction losses. the increases in consulting, information technology and travel and entertainment expenses are all largely attributable to supporting the growth of the business.
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 19.0% for fiscal 2017 as compared with 18.0% for fiscal 2016. the increase is primarily attributable to the growth in comparable adjustments and corporate operations and other selling, general and administrative expenses, which resulted in approximately 70 basis points of rate growth. additionally, the growth in wine and spirits selling, general and administrative expenses having exceeded the growth in wine and spirits net sales resulted in approximately 25 basis points to the rate growth.

operating income increased $634.3 million primarily due to a favorable impact from the change in comparable adjustments of $304.6 million and increases in beer and wine and spirits of $270.3 million and $73.8 million, respectively. the increase for beer is primarily attributable to growth in the mexican beer business of $238.9 million driven largely by the factors discussed above. the increase for wine and spirits is due to operating income from the acquired brands of $63.0 million and growth from the organic wine and spirits business driven primarily by the factors discussed above.
earnings from unconsolidated investments earnings from unconsolidated investments decreased to $27.3 million for fiscal 2017 from $51.1 million for fiscal 2016, a decrease of $23.8 million. this decrease is primarily attributable to an unfavorable impact from the change in comparable adjustments for fiscal 2017.
interest expense interest expense increased to $333.3 million for fiscal 2017 from $313.9 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of $19.4 million, or 6%. this increase is primarily due to higher average borrowings of $1.0 billion and lower average interest rates of 25 basis points, both driven largely by the $1.1 billion in new term loan facilities under our senior credit facility for fiscal 2017 and issuance of the december 2015 senior notes and december 2016 senior notes, partially offset by the repayment of the august 2006 senior notes.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was 26.5% and 29.3%, respectively. for fiscal 2017, our effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lower effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses, including a change in our assertion regarding indefinitely reinvesting earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and the tax effects of the canadian divestiture. for fiscal 2016, our effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to a decrease in uncertain tax positions and lower effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses.
we have historically provided deferred income taxes for the repatriation to the u.s. of earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, in connection with the agreement to divest the canadian wine business and the ongoing beer capacity expansion activities in mexico, including the agreement to acquire the obregon brewery, we changed our assertion regarding our ability and intent to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. approximately $420 million of our fiscal 2017 earnings and all future earnings for these foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested. accordingly, no deferred income taxes have been provided or will be provided, respectively, on the applicable undistributed earnings.
because we intend to use our historical unremitted earnings generated from our existing foreign subsidiaries to continue to support our u.s. investments in the future, our intent to repatriate those historical
37
foreign earnings remains unchanged and accordingly, we continue to provide for anticipated tax liabilities on these amounts that are expected to be repatriated.
for additional information, refer to note 12 of the notes to the financial statements.
we expect our effective tax rate for the next fiscal year to be in the range of 21% to 23%. this includes the assertion of our intent for certain foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested and a favorable benefit from our march 1, 2017, adoption of the fasb's amended guidance requiring the recognition of the income tax effect of stock based compensation awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. through february 28, 2017, this amount was recognized in additional paid-in capital at the time of vesting or settlement.
for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, we recognized excess tax benefits of $131.4 million, $203.4 million and $78.0 million, respectively, in additional paid-in capital. these amounts may not necessarily be indicative of future amounts that may be recognized subsequent to the adoption of this new standard, as any excess tax benefits recognized will be dependent upon future stock prices, employee exercise behavior and applicable tax rates. our current range for next year's effective tax rate includes an estimated 3% benefit related to the adoption of this guidance. since this new standard requires recognition of these excess tax benefits in the income statement on a discrete basis, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending upon the amount of excess tax benefits realized.
net income attributable to cbi as a result of the above factors, net income attributable to cbi increased to $1,535.1 million for fiscal 2017 from $1,054.9 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of $480.2 million, or 46%.

selling, general and administrative expenses increased $98.8 million primarily due to increases in beer of $63.9 million, corporate operations and other of $16.4 million and wine and spirits of $10.0 million.
the increases in beer and wine and spirits are both primarily attributable to an increase in marketing spend due largely to planned investment behind our mexican beer and branded wine and spirits portfolios. the increase in corporate operations and other is due to higher general and administrative expenses primarily attributable to (i)  an increase in compensation and benefits driven primarily by higher annual management incentive compensation expense and an increase in employer payroll taxes related to employee equity award exercise activity during fiscal 2016, and (ii)  higher consulting and information technology expenses supporting the growth of the business.
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales remained relatively flat at 18.0% for fiscal 2016 as compared to 17.9% for fiscal 2015.

operating income increased $264.9 million primarily due to increases in beer and wine and spirits of $246.3 million and $52.7 million, respectively. the increases for both segments are primarily attributable to (i)  organic volume growth and lower cost of product sold and (ii)  benefits from the acquisitions of meiomi (wine and spirits) and ballast point (beer), partially offset by increased marketing spend supporting the growth of the businesses.
earnings from unconsolidated investments earnings from unconsolidated investments increased to $51.1 million for fiscal 2016 from $21.5 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $29.6 million. this increase is primarily attributable to a favorable impact from the change in comparable adjustments for fiscal 2016.
40
interest expense interest expense decreased to $313.9 million for fiscal 2016 from $337.7 million for fiscal 2015, a decrease of $23.8 million, or (7%). this decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 was 29.3% and 29.1%, respectively. for fiscal 2016, our effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a decrease in uncertain tax positions and lower effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses. for fiscal 2015, our effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to lower effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses.
net income attributable to cbi as a result of the above factors, net income attributable to cbi increased to $1,054.9 million for fiscal 2016 from $839.3 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $215.6 million, or 26%.
financial liquidity and capital resources general our ability to consistently generate cash flow from operating activities is one of our most significant financial strengths. our strong cash flows enable us to invest in our people and our brands, make appropriate capital investments, provide a quarterly cash dividend program, and from time-to-time, repurchase shares of our common stock and make strategic acquisitions that we believe will enhance shareholder value. our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operating activities. our principal use of cash in our operating activities is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable. historically, we have used cash flow from operating activities to repay our short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures. we will continue to use our short-term borrowings, including our accounts receivable securitization facilities, to support our working capital requirements and capital expenditures.
we have maintained adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, primarily short-term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs, including (i)  our nava brewery and glass production plant expansions, (ii)  our mexicali brewery construction and (iii)  our obregon brewery optimization (collectively, the "mexico beer expansion projects").

operating activities fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
net cash provided by operating activities increased $282.3 million for fiscal 2017 driven largely by strong cash flow from the beer and wine and spirits segments. the increase in beer was primarily due to the strong volume growth and the favorable pricing in the mexican beer portfolio, partially offset by (i)  the timing of collections for recoverable value-added taxes and (ii)  an increase in beer inventory levels to support the continuing growth within the mexican beer portfolio. the increase in wine and spirits resulted primarily from (i)  cash collections from strong net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, (ii)  a benefit from accounts payable due largely to timing of payments and (iii)  a benefit from the timing of receipt of distributor payments for fiscal 2017; partially offset by an increase in wine and spirits' inventory levels due predominantly to a larger calendar year grape harvest for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016.
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
net cash provided by operating activities increased $332.7 million for fiscal 2016. this increase resulted primarily from (i)  higher cash provided by beer (largely due to strong volume growth in the mexican beer portfolio as well as a reduction in prepaid value-added taxes predominantly attributable to timing) and (ii)  lower income tax payments. the lower income tax payments within cash flows from operating activities are primarily due to an increase in tax benefits on employee equity award exercise and vesting activity, partially offset by an increase in income taxes payable largely attributable to higher taxable income driven by beer.
investing activities fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
net cash used in investing activities decreased $745.6 million for fiscal 2017. this decrease resulted primarily from proceeds from the sale of the canadian wine business in december 2016 of $575.3 million and lower payments for purchases of businesses for fiscal 2017 of $205.4 million. fiscal 2017 acquisitions consist of prisoner (april 2016), high west and charles smith (october 2016), and the obregon brewery (december 2016) compared with fiscal 2016 acquisitions of meiomi (august 2015) and ballast point (december 2015).
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
net cash used in investing activities increased $1,191.5 million for fiscal 2016, primarily due to the fiscal 2016 acquisitions of meiomi and ballast point.
financing activities fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
net cash used in financing activities increased $910.8 million for fiscal 2017, primarily from the following:
•   fiscal 2017 share repurchases under the 2013 authorization and 2017 authorization of $1,122.7 million;
•   fiscal 2017 principal payments of long-term debt driven largely by the repayment of the august 2006 senior notes of $700.0 million;
•   lower net proceeds from notes payable of $163.5 million for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016;
•   higher cash dividend payments of $73.5 million for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016; and
•   lower excess tax benefits from stock-based payment awards of $72.0 million for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 due to decreased fiscal 2017 employee equity award exercise activity;
42
partially offset by:
•   fiscal 2017 proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $1,965.6 million, including (i) term loan borrowings under our senior credit facility of $700.0 million in march 2016 (used to refinance borrowings under our then-existing senior credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facilities, and for other general corporate purposes) and $400.0 million in october 2016 (used to finance the purchase price for the acquisitions of high west and charles smith, and for other general corporate purposes); (ii) proceeds from issuance of the december 2016 senior notes of $600.0 million (used for general corporate purposes) and (iii) term loan borrowings under the canadian credit agreement of c$275.0 million ($214.1 million at issuance) (used for general corporate purposes); compared with
•   fiscal 2016 proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $610.0 million primarily from the issuance of the december 2015 senior notes of $400.0 million (used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of ballast point) and from term loan borrowings under our senior credit facility of $200.0 million (used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of meiomi).
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
net cash provided by financing activities increased $792.4 million for fiscal 2016, primarily from the following:
•   higher net proceeds from notes payable of $347.5 million for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015;
•   higher excess tax benefits from stock-based payment awards of $125.4 million for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 due to increased fiscal 2016 employee equity award exercise and vesting activity;
•   fiscal 2015 payment of delayed purchase price arrangement of $543.3 million in connection with the june 2013 beer business acquisition; and
•   fiscal 2015 principal payments of long-term debt for the repayment of our december 2007 senior notes of $500.0 million;
partially offset by:
•   fiscal 2016 proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $610.0 million primarily from the issuance of the december 2015 senior notes of $400.0 million (used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of ballast point) and from term loan borrowings under the 2015 credit agreement of $200.0 million (used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of meiomi) compared with fiscal 2015 proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $905.0 million primarily from the issuance of the november 2014 senior notes (used primarily to redeem our december 2007 senior notes); and
•   payment of quarterly cash dividends.
debt total debt outstanding as of february 28, 2017, amounted to $9,238.1 million, an increase of $1,156.9 million from february 29, 2016. this increase was largely due to proceeds from the issuance of the european term a-1 and european term a-2 term loan borrowings under our senior credit facility and the december 2016 senior notes, partially offset by the repayment of the august 2006 senior notes.
senior credit facility in october 2016, we entered into the 2016 restatement agreement that amended and restated our march 2016 credit agreement. among other things, the 2016 restatement agreement created a new $400.0 million european term a-2 loan facility maturing on march 10, 2021. proceeds from the october 2016 borrowings under the 2016 credit agreement were primarily used to finance the purchase price for the acquisitions of high west and charles smith, and for other general corporate purposes.
in march 2016, we entered into the march 2016 restatement agreement that amended and restated our then-existing senior credit facility. among other things, the march 2016 restatement agreement created a new
43
$700.0 million european term a-1 loan facility maturing on march 10, 2021. proceeds from the march 2016 borrowings under the march 2016 credit agreement were used to refinance outstanding obligations under our then-existing senior credit facility and short-term borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facilities, and for other general corporate purposes.
senior notes in december 2016, we issued the december 2016 senior notes. proceeds from this offering, net of discount and debt issuance costs, of $594.4 million were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of short-term borrowings and the repurchase of shares of our class a common stock.
in august 2016, we repaid the august 2006 senior notes primarily with cash flows from operating activities.
general the majority of our outstanding borrowings as of february 28, 2017, consisted of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, with maturities ranging from calendar 2017 to calendar 2026, and variable-rate senior unsecured term loan facilities under our 2016 credit agreement, with maturities ranging from calendar 2020 to calendar 2021.
we had the following borrowing capacity available under our 2016 credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization facilities:
remaining borrowing capacity february 28,                   april 21,

crown facility                    $13.0                       $70.4
the financial institutions participating in our 2016 credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization facilities have complied with prior funding requests and we believe such financial institutions will comply with any future funding requests. however, there can be no assurances that any particular financial institution will continue to do so.
as of february 28, 2017, we also have additional credit arrangements totaling $442.8 million, with $269.5 million outstanding under these arrangements. these arrangements primarily support the financing needs of our domestic and foreign subsidiary operations, as well as our glass production plant joint venture.
we have entered into various interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to the volatility of the interest rates associated with our variable-rate senior unsecured term loan facilities. as a result of these hedges, we have fixed our interest rates on $250.0 million of our floating libor rate debt at an average rate of 1.1% (exclusive of borrowing margins) from september 1, 2016, through july 1, 2020.
we and our subsidiaries are subject to covenants that are contained in the 2016 credit agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness), additional liens, mergers and consolidations, the payment of dividends, the making of certain investments, prepayments of certain debt, transactions with affiliates, agreements that restrict our non-guarantor subsidiaries from paying dividends, and dispositions of property, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions and thresholds. the financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net debt coverage ratio, both as defined in the 2016 credit agreement. as of february 28, 2017, the minimum interest coverage ratio was 2.5x and the maximum net debt coverage ratio was 4.0x.
44
our indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes contain certain covenants, including, but not limited to:  (i)  a limitation on liens on certain assets, (ii)  a limitation on certain sale and leaseback transactions and (iii)  restrictions on mergers, consolidations and the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to another person.
as of february 28, 2017, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under both our 2016 credit agreement and our indentures, and have met all debt payment obligations.
for a complete discussion and presentation of all borrowings and available sources of borrowing, refer to note 11 of the notes to the financial statements.
common stock dividends on april 5, 2017, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share of class a common stock, $0.47 per share of class b convertible common stock and $0.47 per share of class 1 common stock payable on may 24, 2017, to stockholders of record of each class on may 10, 2017. we expect to return approximately $400 million to stockholders in fiscal 2018 through cash dividends.
we currently expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend to stockholders of our common stock in the future, but such payments are subject to approval of our board of directors and are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors, including those set forth under item 1a "risk factors" of this annual report on form 10-k.
share repurchase program our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our class a common stock and class b convertible common stock under the 2017 authorization. shares repurchased under this authorization have become treasury shares.
as of february 28, 2017, total shares repurchased under this authorization are as follows:

share repurchases under the 2017 authorization may be accomplished at management's discretion from time to time based on market conditions, our cash and debt position, and other factors as determined by management. shares may be repurchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions. we may fund future share repurchases with cash generated from operations and/or proceeds from borrowings. any repurchased shares will become treasury shares.

(1)   interest rates on long-term debt obligations range from 2.3% to 7.3% as of february 28, 2017. interest payments on long-term debt obligations include amounts associated with our outstanding interest rate swap agreements to fix libor interest rates on $250.0 million of our floating libor rate debt. interest payments on long-term debt do not include interest related to capital lease obligations or certain foreign credit arrangements, which represent approximately 2.6% of our total long-term debt, as amounts are not material.
(2)   other long-term liabilities include $32.8 million associated with expected payments for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as of february 28, 2017, $0.5 million of which is expected to be paid in the less than one year period. the payments are reflected in the period in which we believe they will ultimately be settled based on our experience in these matters. other long-term liabilities do not include payments for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $6.7 million due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. in addition, other long-term liabilities do not include expected payments for interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as amounts are not material. for a detailed discussion of these items, refer to note 12 of the notes to the financial statements.
(3)   total purchase obligations consist primarily of $5,508.1 million for contracts to purchase certain raw materials and supplies over the next thirteen fiscal years and $610.1 million for contracts to purchase equipment and services over the next three fiscal years. for a detailed discussion of our purchase obligations, refer to note 13 of the notes to the financial statements.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
capital expenditures during fiscal 2017, we incurred $907.4 million for capital expenditures, including $759.2 million for the beer segment primarily for the mexico beer expansion projects. management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current business needs. we plan to spend from $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion for capital expenditures for fiscal 2018, including from $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion for the beer segment associated primarily with the mexico beer expansion projects. the remaining fiscal 2018 capital expenditures consist of improvements of existing operating facilities and replacements of existing equipment and/or buildings. we expect to spend the remaining amounts under the previously announced mexico beer expansion projects primarily during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. upon completion, the total spend from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2021 for the mexico beer expansion projects is estimated to approximate $3.9 billion.
effects of inflation and changing prices our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices. we intend to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices, subject to normal
46
competitive conditions. there can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices. in addition, we continue to identify on-going cost savings initiatives.
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of our notes to the financial statements. however, certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management; as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. in applying those policies, management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. those estimates are based on our historical experience, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. on an ongoing basis, we review our estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business. our critical accounting estimates include:
•   goodwill and other intangible assets. we account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories: (i) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, (ii) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and (iii) goodwill. for intangible assets with definite lives, impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill, impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. we perform annual impairment tests and re-evaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of january 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment or change in useful life might exist. the guidance for goodwill impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or to proceed directly to performing the two-step impairment test. in the first step, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is generally calculated based on an income approach using the discounted cash flow method supplemented by the market approach. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, a second step is performed to determine the amount of goodwill impairment we should record. in the second step, an implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill is compared to the carrying value of the goodwill. the amount of impairment charge for goodwill is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. our reporting units include the beer segment and u.s., new zealand and italy for the wine and spirits segment. in estimating the fair value of the reporting units, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, future earnings and other factors. the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are based on historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans. these assumptions reflect management's estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets. the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis. no indication of impairment was noted for any of our reporting units, as the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value. based on this analysis, of all of our reporting units, the reporting unit with the lowest amount of estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value was the wine and spirits' u.s. reporting unit with approximately 81% excess fair value. in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analyses, we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for any of our reporting units.

the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows calculation to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units in connection with impairment testing are: (i)  the discount rate, (ii)  the expected long-term growth rate and (iii)  the annual cash flow projections. as of january 1, 2017, if we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of goodwill, then the changes individually would not have resulted in the carrying value of the respective reporting unit's net assets, including its goodwill, exceeding its estimated fair value, which would indicate the potential for impairment and the requirement to measure the amount of impairment, if any.
our other intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions. customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives. the trademarks that were determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. the guidance for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired or to proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value. the estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method. the estimate of fair value is then compared to the carrying value of each trademark. if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the trademark, then an impairment charge is recorded by us to reduce the carrying value of the trademark to its estimated fair value. in estimating the fair value of the trademarks, management must make assumptions and projections regarding future cash flows based upon future revenues and other factors. the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans. these assumptions reflect management's estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets. the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the wine and spirits' u.s. business recognized a trademark impairment loss of $37.6 million in connection with our decision to discontinue certain small-scale, low-margin u.s. brands. additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the wine and spirits' u.s. business recognized a trademark impairment loss of $8.4 million in connection with certain u.s. brands sold exclusively through the canadian wine business, for which we expect future sales of these brands to be minimal subsequent to the canadian divestiture. no indication of impairment was noted for any of our indefinite lived intangible assets for fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2015.
the most significant assumptions used in the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are:  (i)  the estimated royalty rate, (ii)  the discount rate, (iii)  the expected long-term growth rate and (iv)  the annual revenue projections. as of january 1, 2017, if we used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower or used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual revenue projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives, then each change individually would not have resulted in any unit of accounting's carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value.
•   accounting for promotional activities. sales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs, including pricing discounts on single transactions, volume discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, coupons and rebates. certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the cost of those programs. the accrued liability for these programs is determined through analysis of programs offered, historical trends, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, sales and payment trends, and experience with payment

patterns associated with similar programs that have been offered previously. if assumptions included in our estimates were to change or market conditions were to change, then material incremental reductions to revenue could be required, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
•   accounting for income taxes. we estimate our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based upon various factors including, but not limited to, historical pretax operating income, future estimates of pretax operating income, differences between book and tax treatment of items of income and expense, and tax planning strategies. we are subject to income taxes in canada, luxembourg, mexico, new zealand, the u.s. and other jurisdictions. we recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in our results of operations. if necessary, we record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. we believe that all tax positions are fully supported; however, we record tax liabilities in accordance with the fasb's guidance for income tax accounting. we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. in addition, changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our tax liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. changes in current estimates, if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

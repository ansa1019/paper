item 1a.   risk factors

prospective investors should consider carefully the risk factors set forth below before making an investment in the company's securities.
the company must respond to changes in consumer behavior as a result of new technologies in order to remain competitive.
technology, particularly digital technology used in the entertainment industry, continues to evolve rapidly, leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content. these technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume digital content. content owners are increasingly delivering their content directly to consumers over the internet and innovations in distribution platforms have enabled consumers to view such internet-delivered content on televisions and portable devices. the growth of direct to consumer video offerings, including video-on-demand offerings, as well as offerings by cable providers of smaller packages of programming to customers at price points lower than traditional cable distribution offerings could adversely affect demand for our cable channels. there is a risk that the company's responses to these changes and strategies to remain competitive, or failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to new market changes, could adversely affect our business. in addition, enhanced internet capabilities and other new media may reduce television viewership, the demand for dvds and blu-rays and the desire to see motion pictures in theaters, which could negatively affect the company's revenues. the company's failure to protect and exploit the value of its content, while responding to and developing new technology and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences, could have a significant adverse effect on the company's businesses, asset values and results of operations.
acceptance of the company's films and television programming by the public is difficult to predict, which could lead to fluctuations in revenues.
feature film and television production and distribution are speculative businesses since the revenues derived from the production and distribution of a feature film or television series depend primarily upon its acceptance by the public, which is difficult to predict. the commercial success of a feature film or television series also depends
24
upon the quality and acceptance of other competing films and television series released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of a growing number of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and their effects on consumer spending and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty. further, the theatrical success of a feature film and the audience ratings for a television series are generally key factors in generating revenues from other distribution channels, such as home entertainment and premium pay television, with respect to feature films, and syndication, with respect to television series.
the inability to renew sports programming rights could cause the company's affiliate and advertising revenue to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets.
the sports rights contracts between the company, on the one hand, and various professional sports leagues and teams, on the other, have varying duration and renewal terms. as these contracts expire, renewals on favorable terms may be sought; however, third parties may outbid the current rights holders for the rights contracts. in addition, professional sports leagues or teams may create their own networks or the renewal costs could substantially exceed the original contract cost. the loss of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by the company and its affiliates, as it relates to fox, and could adversely affect the company's advertising and affiliate revenues. upon renewal, the company's results could be adversely affected if escalations in sports programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in advertising rates and, in the case of cable networks, subscriber fees.
a decline in advertising expenditures could cause the company's revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets.
the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on or in its television stations and broadcast and cable networks. expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers' spending priorities. demand for the company's products is also a factor in determining advertising rates. for example, ratings points for the company's television stations and broadcast and cable networks are factors that are weighed when determining advertising rates, and with respect to the company's television stations and broadcast and television networks, when determining the affiliate rates received by the company. in addition, newer technologies, including new video formats, streaming and downloading capabilities via the internet, video-on-demand, personal video recorders and other devices and technologies are increasing the number of media and entertainment choices available to audiences. some of these devices and technologies allow users to view television or motion pictures from a remote location or on a time-delayed basis and provide users the ability to fast-forward, rewind, pause and skip programming and advertisements. these technological developments which are increasing the number of media and entertainment choices available to audiences could negatively impact not only consumer demand for our content and services but also could affect the attractiveness of the company's offerings to viewers, advertisers and/or distributors. failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging technologies or changes in consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our business. further, a decrease in advertising expenditures, reduced demand for the company's offerings or the inability to obtain market ratings that adequately measure demand for the company's content on personal video recorders and mobile devices could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on the company's businesses and assets.
the loss of carriage agreements could cause the company's revenue and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets.
the company's broadcast stations and cable networks maintain affiliation and carriage arrangements that enable them to reach a large percentage of cable and direct broadcast satellite households across the united states. the loss of a significant number of these arrangements or the loss of carriage on basic programming tiers could reduce the distribution of the company's broadcast stations and cable networks, which may adversely affect those networks' revenues from affiliate fees and their ability to sell national and local advertising time. the company is dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with third party owned television stations and there can be no assurance that these affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future on terms acceptable to the company. the loss of a significant number of these affiliation arrangements could reduce the distribution of fox and mynetworktv and adversely affect the company's ability to sell national advertising time.
25
the company relies on network and information systems and other technology whose failure or misuse, could cause a disruption of services or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.
network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to the company's network management, are important to its business activities. network and information systems-related events, such as computer hackings, theft, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power outages, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities or human error that may affect such systems, could result in disruption of our services or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of sophisticated cyber attacks on network and information systems, and as a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase. the company has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which has been material to the company to date. while we continue to develop, implement and maintain security measures seeking to prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of our network and information systems, such efforts may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring given that the techniques used to access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently. the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated.  significant security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification, accidental release, or otherwise improper disclosure of information maintained in the company's information systems and networks or those of our vendors, including financial, personal, confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel, customers, vendors and our business, including our intellectual property, could result in a disruption of our operations, customer or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation or brands, regulatory investigations, lawsuits or loss of customers or revenue. in addition, the company may be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy, and may require us to expend significant resources to remedy any such security breach.
technological developments may increase the threat of content piracy and signal theft and limit the company's ability to protect its intellectual property rights.
content piracy and signal theft present a threat to the company's revenues from products and services, including, but not limited to, films, television shows, cable and other programming. the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy and direct broadcast satellite programming signal theft; however, policing unauthorized use of the company's products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the company may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties. developments in technology, including digital copying, file compressing and the growing penetration of high-bandwidth internet connections, increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute high-quality pirated material. in addition, developments in software or devices that circumvent encryption technology and the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies increase the threat of unauthorized use and distribution of direct broadcast satellite programming signals and the proliferation of user-generated content sites and live and stored video streaming sites, which deliver unauthorized copies of copyrighted content, including those emanating from other countries in various languages, may adversely impact the company's businesses. the proliferation of unauthorized distribution and use of the company's content could have an adverse effect on the company's businesses and profitability because it reduces the revenue that the company could potentially receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its products and services.
the company has taken, and will continue to take, a variety of actions to combat piracy and signal theft, both individually and, in some instances, together with industry associations. however, protection of the company's intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of the company's rights as defined by applicable laws in the united states and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company's rights, or if existing laws are changed, the company's ability to generate revenue from intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and enforcing our rights may increase. there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products, services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy or signal theft. further, while piracy and technology tools continue to escalate, if any u.s. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property are repealed or weakened or not adequately enforced, or if the legal system
26
fails to evolve and adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights could increase.
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company's results of operations.
the company has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of the company operations are conducted in foreign currencies. the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the u.s. dollar. for example, in fiscal 2016, the u.s. dollar appreciated in relation to the euro, the canadian dollar, the mexican peso, the brazilian real, the indian rupee and the pound sterling. as a result, the company is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations, which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations in a given period or in specific markets. even though the company uses foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposures to foreign currency exchange rate risks, the use of such derivative instruments may not be effective in reducing the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. in addition, countries where we have operations, including in latin america, may be determined in the future to be highly inflationary economies, requiring special accounting and financial reporting treatment for such operations.
labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the company's business.
in a variety of the company's businesses, the company and its partners engage the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent, trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements, including employees of the company's film and television studio operations. if the company or its partners are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. such actions, as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on the company's business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins.
changes in u.s. or foreign regulations may have an adverse effect on the company's business.
the company is subject to a variety of u.s. and foreign regulations in the jurisdictions in which its businesses operate. in general, the television broadcasting and multichannel video programming and distribution industries in the united states are highly regulated by federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the federal communications commission (the "fcc"). the fcc generally regulates, among other things, the ownership of media, broadcast and multichannel video programming and technical operations of broadcast licensees. our program services and online properties are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including those relating to issues such as content regulation, user privacy and data protection, and consumer protection, among others. further, the united states congress, the fcc and state legislatures currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters, including technological changes and measures relating to privacy and data security, which could, directly or indirectly, affect the operations and ownership of the company's u.s. media properties. similarly, new laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of law or in regulations imposed by governments in other jurisdictions in which the company, or entities in which the company has an interest, operate could require changes in the operations or ownership of our media properties. in addition, laws in non-u.s. jurisdictions which regulate, among other things, licensing arrangements, local content requirements, carriage requirements regarding pricing and distribution, and limitations on advertising time, may impact the operations and results of our international businesses.
in addition, changes in laws, regulations or the interpretations thereof in the u.s. and other jurisdictions in which the company has operations could affect the company's results of operations.
u.s. citizenship requirements may limit common stock ownership and voting rights.
the company owns broadcast station licensees in connection with its ownership and operation of u.s. television stations. under u.s. law, no broadcast station licensee may be owned by a corporation if more than 25% of its stock is owned or voted by non-u.s. persons, their representatives, or by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country. the company's restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to prevent, cure or mitigate the effect of stock ownership above the applicable foreign ownership threshold by taking any action including: refusing to permit any transfer of common stock to or ownership of common stock
27
by a non-u.s. stockholder; voiding a transfer of common stock to a non-u.s. stockholder; suspending rights of stock ownership if held by a non-u.s. stockholder; or redeeming common stock held by a non-u.s. stockholder. in order to maintain compliance with u.s. law, during fiscal 2016, the company had suspended 10% of the voting rights of the class b common stock held by non-u.s. stockholders. in august 2016, the company eliminated the suspension of voting rights of shares of class b common stock and remains in compliance with applicable u.s. law. the company continues to monitor its foreign ownership based on its assessment of the information reasonably available to it, but it is not able to predict whether it will need to reinstate the suspension or whether additional action pursuant to its restated certificate of incorporation may be necessary. the fcc could review the company's compliance with applicable u.s. law in connection with its consideration of the company's renewal applications for licenses to operate the broadcast stations the company owns.
the company could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.
we are subject to taxation in u.s. federal, state and local jurisdictions and many non-u.s. jurisdictions. changes in tax laws, regulations, practices or the interpretations thereof could affect the company's results of operations.  judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for taxes. in addition, transactions occur during the ordinary course of business or otherwise for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
our tax returns are routinely audited, tax-related litigation or settlements may occur, and u.s. or foreign jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. the final outcomes of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could result in materially different tax recognition from our historical tax provisions and accruals. these outcomes could conflict with private letter rulings, opinions of counsel or other interpretations provided to the company. if these matters are adversely resolved, we may be required to recognize additional charges to our tax provisions and pay significant additional amounts with respect to current or prior periods or our taxes in the future could increase, which could affect our operating results and financial condition.
in connection with the separation, the company received a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion from hogan lovells us llp confirming the tax-free status of the distribution and related internal transactions for u.s. federal income tax purposes. notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the opinion, the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions or representations relied upon for the private letter ruling is not correct or has been violated. if these transactions are determined to be taxable, the company would recognize gains on the internal reorganization and/or recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of the news corp common stock distributed to our stockholders on the distribution date over our tax basis in such shares of our common stock. in addition, other tax authorities could determine on audit that the distribution or the related internal reorganizations should be treated as taxable transactions.
in addition, under the terms of a tax sharing and indemnification agreement that we entered into in connection with the separation, we are required to indemnify news corp against u.s. consolidated and combined tax liabilities attributable to all tax periods or portions thereof prior to june 29, 2013. disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the irs that could give rise to indemnification obligations under this agreement in amounts that we cannot quantify.
the company is exposed to risks associated with weak domestic and global economic conditions and increased volatility and disruption in the financial markets.
the company's businesses, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by weak domestic and global economic conditions. factors that affect economic conditions include the rate of unemployment, the level of consumer confidence and changes in consumer spending habits. the company also faces risks, including currency volatility and the stability of global local economies, associated with the impact of weak domestic and global economic conditions on advertisers, affiliates, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers, insurers, theater operators and others with which it does business.
increased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets could make it more difficult and more expensive for the company to refinance outstanding indebtedness and obtain new financing. disruptions in the financial markets can also adversely affect the company's lenders, insurers, customers and counterparties, including vendors,
28
retailers and film co-financing partners. for instance, the inability of the company's counterparties to obtain capital on acceptable terms could impair their ability to perform under their agreements with the company and lead to negative effects on the company, including business disruptions, decreased revenues and increases in bad debt expenses.
the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets and programming.
in accordance with applicable generally accepted accounting principles, the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including fcc licenses. the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as the prevailing conditions in the capital markets, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived assets. any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in advertising revenue and/or the expected popularity of the programming for which the company has acquired rights could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units. a downward revision in the fair value of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments or long-lived assets could result in an impairment and a non-cash charge would be required. any such charge could be material to the company's reported net earnings.
certain of our directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in news corp, and certain of our officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because they also serve as officers and/or on the board of directors of news corp.
certain of our directors and executive officers own shares of news corp's common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. in addition, certain of our officers and directors also serve as officers and/or as directors of news corp, including our executive chairmen k. rupert murdoch, who serves as news corp's executive chairman, and lachlan k. murdoch, who serves as news corp's co-chairman. this ownership or service to both companies may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for news corp and us. in addition to any other arrangements that the company and news corp may agree to implement, the company and news corp agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies.

overview of the company's business the company is a diversified global media and entertainment company, which manages and reports its businesses in the following segments:
·   cable network programming, which principally consists of the production and licensing of programming distributed primarily through cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite operators, telecommunication companies and online video distributors in the united states ("u.s.") and internationally.

·   television, which principally consists of the broadcasting of network programming in the u.s. and the operation of 28 full power broadcast television stations, including 11 duopolies, in the u.s. (of these stations, 17 are affiliated with the fox broadcasting company ("fox"), 10 are affiliated with master distribution service, inc. ("mynetworktv") and one is an independent station).

·   filmed entertainment, which principally consists of the production and acquisition of live-action and animated motion pictures for distribution and licensing in all formats in all entertainment media worldwide, and the production and licensing of television programming worldwide.

·   direct broadcast satellite television, which consisted of the distribution of programming services via satellite, cable and broadband directly to subscribers in italy, germany and austria. the direct broadcast satellite television ("dbs") segment consisted entirely of the operations of sky italia and sky deutschland ag ("sky deutschland") (collectively, the "dbs businesses"). on november 12, 2014, twenty-first century fox completed the sale of sky italia and its 57% interest in sky deutschland to sky plc ("sky") (see note 3 - acquisitions, disposals and other transactions to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "sky italia and sky deutschland"). sky is a pan-european digital television provider, which operates in italy, germany, austria, the united kingdom and ireland.

·   other, corporate and eliminations, which principally consists of corporate overhead and eliminations and other businesses.

following the sale of the dbs businesses, the company continues to report in five segments for comparative purposes, and there is no current activity in the dbs segment.
cable network programming and television the company's cable networks, which target various demographics, derive a majority of their revenues from monthly affiliate fees received from multi-channel video programming distributors ("mvpds") based on the number of their subscribers. affiliate fee revenues are net of the amortization of cable distribution investments (capitalized fees paid to u.s. mvpds to typically facilitate the carriage of a domestic cable network). the company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract period. in the u.s., cable television and direct broadcast satellite are currently the predominant means of distribution of the company's program services. internationally, distribution technology varies region by region.
the television operations derive revenues primarily from the sale of advertising, and to a lesser extent, retransmission consent revenue. adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising may affect revenues.
u.s. law governing retransmission consent revenue provides a mechanism for the television stations owned by the company to seek and obtain payment from mvpds who carry the company's broadcast signals. retransmission consent revenue consists of per subscriber-based compensatory fees paid to the company by mvpds that distribute the signals of the company's owned and operated television stations. the company also receives compensation from independently-owned television stations that are affiliated with fox and receive retransmission consent fees from mvpds for their signals.
the most significant operating expenses of the cable network programming segment and the television segment are the acquisition and production expenses related to programming, marketing and promotional expenses, and the expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the cable network or broadcaster. marketing and promotional expenses relate to improving the market visibility and awareness of the cable network or broadcaster
36
and its programming. additional expenses include sales commissions paid to the in-house advertising sales force, as well as salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead expenses.
the profitability of u.s. national sports contracts and certain international sports rights agreements is based on the company's best estimates at june 30, 2016 of attributable revenues and costs; such estimates may change in the future and such changes may be significant. should revenues decline from estimates applied at june 30, 2016, additional amortization of rights may be recognized. should revenues improve as compared to estimated revenues, the company may have improved results related to the contract, which may be recognized over the remaining contract term.
filmed entertainment the filmed entertainment segment derives revenue from the production and distribution of live-action and animated motion pictures and television series. in general, motion pictures produced or acquired for distribution by the company are exhibited in u.s. and foreign theaters, followed by home entertainment, including sale and rental of dvds and blu-rays, licensing through digital distribution platforms, premium subscription television, network television and basic cable and syndicated television exploitation. television series initially produced for the networks and first-run syndication are generally licensed to domestic and international markets concurrently and subsequently released in seasonal dvd and blu-ray box sets and made available via digital distribution platforms. more successful series are later syndicated in domestic markets. the length of the revenue cycle for television series will vary depending on the number of seasons a series remains in active production and, therefore, may cause fluctuations in operating results. license fees received for television exhibition (including international and u.s. premium television and basic cable television) are recorded as revenue in the period that licensed films or programs are available for such exhibition, which may cause substantial fluctuations in operating results.
the revenues and operating results of the filmed entertainment segment are significantly affected by the timing of the company's theatrical and home entertainment releases, the number of its original and returning television series that are aired by television networks and cable channels and the number of its television series in off-network syndication. theatrical and home entertainment release dates are determined by several factors, including timing of vacation and holiday periods and competition in the marketplace. the distribution windows for the release of motion pictures theatrically and in various home entertainment products and services (including subscription rentals, rental kiosks and digital distribution platforms), have been compressing and may continue to change in the future. a further reduction in timing between theatrical and home entertainment releases could adversely affect the revenues and operating results of this segment.
the company enters into arrangements with third parties to co-produce certain of its theatrical and television productions. these arrangements, which are referred to as co-financing arrangements, take various forms. the parties to these arrangements, primarily for theatrical productions, include studio and non-studio entities both domestic and international. in several of these agreements, other parties control certain distribution rights. the filmed entertainment segment records the amounts received for the sale of an economic interest as a reduction of the cost of the film, as the investor assumes full risk for that portion of the film asset acquired in these transactions. the substance of these arrangements is that the third-party investors own an interest in the film and, therefore, receive a participation based on the third-party investors' contractual interest in the profits or losses incurred on the film. consistent with the requirements of financial accounting standards board ("fasb") accounting standards codification ("asc") 926, "entertainment-films" ("asc 926"), the estimate of the third-party investor's interest in profits or losses on the film is based on total estimated ultimate revenues.
operating costs incurred by the filmed entertainment segment include: exploitation costs, primarily theatrical prints and advertising and home entertainment marketing and manufacturing costs; amortization of capitalized production, overhead and interest costs; and participations and talent residuals. selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead expenses.
other business developments see note 3 - acquisitions, disposals and other transactions, under the heading "fiscal 2016", and note 7 - investments, under the heading "other", to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox for a discussion of the company's business developments.

overview - the company's revenues decreased 6% for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. the changes in revenues were primarily due to the effect of the sale of the dbs businesses in november 2014. excluding the activity of the dbs businesses, the company's revenues increased 1% for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher affiliate fee and advertising revenues partially offset by lower content revenue. the increase
38
in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to higher average rates per subscriber across most channels, and the increase in advertising revenue was led by higher pricing at fox news channel ("fox news") and increases at the international cable channels. the decrease in content revenue was primarily attributable to lower worldwide home entertainment and theatrical revenues and the effect of the disposition of shine group in december 2014. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately $725 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.
operating expenses decreased 8% for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the sale of the dbs businesses in november 2014 and shine group in december 2014 partially offset by higher operating expenses at the cable network programming and television segments.
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3% for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the sale of the dbs businesses and shine group partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses at the cable network programming segment.
depreciation and amortization, including the amortization of acquired identifiable intangible assets, decreased 28% for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization as a result of the sale of the dbs businesses.
equity (losses) earnings of affiliates - equity (losses) earnings of affiliates decreased $938 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to lower results at sky. included in sky's results for fiscal 2015 was the company's proportionate share of approximately $790 million of sky's gains related to the sale of its investments in ngc network international, llc and ngc network latin america, llc (collectively, "ngc international"), sky betting & gaming ("sky bet") and itv plc. also contributing to this decrease were lower results at endemol shine core joint venture (see note 3 - acquisitions, disposals and other transactions to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "shine group") and hulu llc. endemol shine core joint venture's results for fiscal 2016 include the company's proportionate share related to the loss on deconsolidation of a subsidiary and other impairment charges of approximately $95 million (see note 7 - investments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "other equity affiliates").

interest expense, net - interest expense decreased $14 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the effect of the amendment to the yankees entertainment and sports network (the "yes network") credit agreement in fiscal 2015 (as described in note 11 - borrowings to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "bank loans") partially offset by higher average debt outstanding as a result of the issuance in october 2015 of $600 million of 3.70% senior notes due 2025 and $400 million of 4.95% senior notes due 2045.

income tax expense - the company's tax provision and related effective tax rate of 27% for fiscal 2016 was lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a 3% rate reduction from the company's foreign operations and a 4% rate reduction from increased tax amortization deductions for certain film and television properties as a result of a ruling that was received by the company. in addition, increases in the net provision for uncertain tax positions were substantially offset by the final settlement of a foreign matter.
the company's tax provision and related effective tax rate of 13% for fiscal 2015 was lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the income tax benefits associated with the reversal of previously recorded valuation allowances related to capital loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards utilized to offset the income tax liability from the disposition of the dbs businesses. the reversal of the valuation allowance yielded an aggregate income tax benefit of 17% for the year. the company also recognized a benefit of approximately 3% associated with the recognition of various tax benefits. these benefits primarily related to the reversal of additional valuation allowances related to the company's foreign tax credit carryforwards as the company separately determined that it was more likely than not that the company would utilize these credit carryforwards before they expire.
net income - net income decreased for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the comparative effect of the gain on the sale of the dbs businesses in november 2014 and a decrease in equity (losses) earnings of affiliates.

overview - the company's revenues decreased 9% for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. the changes in revenues were primarily due to the effect of the sale of the dbs businesses in november 2014. excluding the activity of the dbs businesses, the company's revenues increased 3% for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to higher affiliate fee revenue partially offset by a decrease in advertising revenue. the increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily attributable to higher average rates per subscriber across most channels and the
41
effect of the acquisition of the majority interest in the yes network in february 2014. the decrease in advertising revenue for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the comparative effect of the broadcast of super bowl xlviii in february 2014 and lower general entertainment primetime ratings at fox. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately $625 million for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.
operating expenses decreased 12% for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the sale of the dbs businesses in november 2014 partially offset by increases at the cable network programming segment. during fiscal 2015, operating expenses at the cable network programming segment increased approximately $1 billion primarily due to higher programming costs including star sports' broadcast of the international cricket council ("icc") cricket world cup matches, fox sports 1's ("fs1") inaugural broadcast of major league baseball ("mlb") regular season and playoff games and the continued investment in new shows at fx networks suite of channels ("fx").
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 8% for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the sale of the dbs businesses in november 2014 partially offset by increases at the cable network programming segment of approximately $255 million. the increase at the cable network programming segment for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to transaction losses on foreign currency exchange movements at fox networks group international ("fng international"), the continued investment in star's sports and general entertainment channels and the effect of the acquisitions of the majority interest in the yes network in february 2014 and true[x] in february 2015.
depreciation and amortization, including the amortization of acquired identifiable intangible assets, decreased 36% for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization as a result of the sale of the dbs businesses. these decreases were partially offset by the amortization of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of the majority interest in the yes network in february 2014.
equity earnings of affiliates - equity earnings of affiliates increased $282 million for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. the increase was due to higher results at sky which included the company's proportionate share of approximately $790 million of gains related to the sale of sky's investments in sky bet, itv plc and ngc international. partially offsetting these increases were the results at endemol shine core joint venture, an affiliate from december 2014 (see note 3 - acquisitions, disposals and other transactions to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "shine group"), lower results at hulu llc and the effect of the acquisition of the majority interest in the yes network in february 2014.

interest expense, net - interest expense increased $77 million for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the higher average debt outstanding as a result of the debt consolidated in connection with the acquisition of the majority interest in the yes network in february 2014, and subsequently modified in november 2014, and the issuance in september 2014 of $600 million of 3.70% senior notes due 2024 and $600 million of 4.75% senior notes due 2044.

income tax expense - the company's tax provision and related effective tax rate of 13% for fiscal 2015 was lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the income tax benefits associated with the reversal of previously recorded valuation allowances related to capital loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards utilized to offset the income tax liability from the disposition of the dbs businesses. the reversal of the valuation allowance yielded an aggregate income tax benefit of 17% for the year. the company also recognized a benefit of approximately 3% associated with the recognition of various tax benefits. these benefits primarily related to the reversal of additional valuation allowances related to the company's foreign tax credit carryforwards as the company separately determined that it was more likely than not that the company would utilize these credit carryforwards before they expire.
the company's tax provision and related effective tax rate of 25% for fiscal 2014 was lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a 7% rate reduction from our foreign operations due to tax credits and deductions arising from a corporate restructuring as well as the effect of income attributable to noncontrolling interests. the balance of the difference in the rate was primarily attributable to the company's ability to utilize the domestic production activities deduction and the recognition of a deferred tax asset for additional tax basis.
(loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax - for fiscal 2015, the company recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $67 million as compared to income of $729 million in fiscal 2014. the change was primarily due to the recognition, in fiscal 2014, of a tax reimbursement paid to news corporation ("news corp") and then transferred to the company in accordance with the tax sharing and indemnification agreement entered into at the time of the separation. prior to the separation, a subsidiary of news corp had filed for tax reimbursement in a foreign jurisdiction (see note 4 - discontinued operations to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox for further discussion).
net income - net income increased for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the gain on the sale of the dbs businesses in november 2014.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests - the change in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily due to the effect of the sale of the company's interest in sky deutschland in november 2014.

segment analysis the company's operating segments have been determined in accordance with the company's internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. the company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment oibda. due to the integrated nature of these operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses.
segment oibda is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. segment oibda does not include: amortization of cable distribution investments, depreciation and amortization, equity (losses) earnings of affiliates, interest expense, net, interest income, other, net, income tax expense, (loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. management believes that segment oibda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the company's business segments because it is the primary measure used by the company's chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the company's businesses.
management believes that information about total segment oibda assists all users of the company's consolidated financial statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the company's portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. total segment oibda provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the company's business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors' data, although historical results, including segment oibda and total segment oibda, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).
total segment oibda may be considered a non-gaap measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). in addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the company's financial performance.

cable network programming (55% and 48% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively)
for fiscal 2016, revenues at the cable network programming segment increased $1.3 billion, or 9%, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher affiliate fee, advertising and content and other revenues as shown below:

advertising                  7        %
content and other           45        %
these revenue increases are net of a decrease of approximately $475 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies, primarily in latin america, europe and india. for fiscal 2016, revenues related to the publishing, travel and certain other businesses (the "ngs media business") acquired in november 2015 from the national geographic society (see note 3 - acquisitions, disposals and other transactions to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "national geographic partners") were approximately $230 million.
domestic affiliate fee revenue increased 8% for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher average rates per subscriber across most channels led by fs1, fx, fox news and the regional sports networks ("rsns"). domestic advertising revenue increased 9% for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher pricing at fox news and fox business network. also contributing to the increase in domestic advertising revenue were additional broadcasts of the national basketball association ("nba"), mlb and national hockey league games at the rsns and the effect of the acquisition of the ngs media business.

for fiscal 2016, international affiliate fee revenue and international advertising revenue each increased 3%, as compared to fiscal 2015. the increase in international affiliate fee revenue was the result of local currency growth led by additional subscribers and higher rates at fng international and star india ("star"), partially offset by the adverse impact of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies. the increase in international advertising revenue was the result of local currency increases at fng international's general entertainment channels in europe and latin america and higher volume and pricing at star's general entertainment channels, partially offset by the adverse impact of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies.
for fiscal 2016, content and other revenues increased 45%, as compared to fiscal 2015. the increase in content and other revenues was due to the effect of the acquisition of the ngs media business, increased revenues at the international sports channels related to the syndication of sports rights and the licensing of outcast at fng international.
for fiscal 2016, segment oibda at the cable network programming segment increased $497 million, or 11%, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by higher expenses of $759 million, or 8%, as compared to fiscal 2015. operating expenses increased approximately $605 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher sports programming rights, the acquisition of the ngs media business in november 2015, higher political coverage costs at fox news and higher programming rights at the international entertainment channels. the increase in sports programming rights includes contractual rate increases for mlb and nba rights at the rsns, ultimate fighting championship and mlb rights at fs1 and conmebol soccer rights at fng international partially offset by a decrease in sports programming costs at star as a result of the comparative effect of star's broadcast of the icc cricket world cup matches in fiscal 2015. selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $150 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the effect of the acquisitions of the ngs media business in november 2015 and truex media inc. in february 2015 and higher personnel costs. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a segment oibda decrease of approximately $220 million, as compared to fiscal 2015.
television (19% and 17% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively)
for fiscal 2016, revenues at the television segment increased $210 million, or 4%, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher affiliate fee and advertising revenues. affiliate fee revenue increased 18% as a result of higher retransmission consent rates for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. advertising revenue increased 1% for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher sports and entertainment advertising revenues at fox, partially offset by the comparative effect of the political advertising revenues related to the 2014 mid-term elections. sports advertising revenue increased primarily due to higher pricing for the broadcasts of the national football league ("nfl") regular season and the mlb world series partially offset by the effect of fewer broadcasts of the nfl post season and the mlb world series. entertainment advertising revenue increased primarily due to higher pricing and increased non-linear advertising revenue, partially offset by lower ratings.
for fiscal 2016, segment oibda at the television segment increased $26 million, or 4%, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by higher expenses of $184 million, or 4%, as compared to fiscal 2015. operating expenses increased approximately $135 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to contractual rate increases for sports rights at fox, including mlb and nfl rights.
filmed entertainment (31% and 33% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively)
for fiscal 2016, revenues at the filmed entertainment segment decreased $1.0 billion, or 11%, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the effect of the disposition of shine group in december 2014 and lower worldwide home entertainment and theatrical revenues from motion picture productions. fiscal 2016 revenues included the worldwide theatrical and home entertainment releases of deadpool and the martian and the worldwide theatrical release of x-men: apocalypse, as compared to fiscal 2015, which included the worldwide theatrical, home entertainment and pay television releases of dawn of the planet of the apes, maze runner and gone girl and the worldwide theatrical and home entertainment releases of how to train your dragon 2, kingsman: the secret

service and night at the museum: secret of the tomb. also contributing to the decrease in revenue for fiscal 2016 were lower content revenues from television productions reflecting lower network and syndication revenue from the final seasons of glee and sons of anarchy as well as the non-recurring domestic cable syndication sale of how i met your mother in the prior year. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately $250 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.
for fiscal 2016, segment oibda decreased $360 million, or 25%, primarily due to the revenue decreases noted above partially offset by lower expenses of $660 million, or 8%, as compared to fiscal 2015. operating expenses decreased approximately $575 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the disposition of shine group, lower marketing and distribution costs resulting from the mix of home entertainment releases in the prior year as compared to the current year, and lower production amortization and participation costs related to motion picture productions. selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $85 million for fiscal 2016, compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the disposition of shine group. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a segment oibda decrease of approximately $160 million, as compared to fiscal 2015.
in december 2014, the company disposed of its interests in shine group by contributing it into endemol shine core joint venture. for fiscal 2015, revenue related to the shine group was approximately $350 million.

cable network programming (48% and 39% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively)
for fiscal 2015, revenues at the cable network programming segment increased $1.5 billion, or 12%, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to higher affiliate fee and advertising revenues as shown below:
fiscal 2015
% increase

affiliate fees        13        %
advertising            8        %
these revenue increases are net of a decrease of approximately $355 million for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies.
domestic affiliate fee revenue increased 17% for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. approximately 60% of the increase for fiscal 2015 was due to higher average rates per subscriber across most channels led by fs1, the rsns, fox news and fx. the balance of the growth was primarily attributable to the effect of the acquisition of the majority interest in the yes network in february 2014. domestic advertising revenue increased 4% for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the effect of the acquisition of the majority interest in yes network and strong advertising growth led by fs1's inaugural broadcast of mlb regular season and playoff games, higher pricing at fox news and higher ratings at fx.
for fiscal 2015, international affiliate fee revenue increased 3%, as compared to fiscal 2014. the increase in international affiliate fee revenue was led by local currency growth, primarily at fng international, as a result of additional subscribers and higher rates in latin america and new affiliate agreements at star. for fiscal 2015, international advertising revenue increased 14%, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily driven by higher ratings and
48
increased pricing at star's entertainment channels and the broadcast of the icc cricket world cup matches on star sports. the increase in international affiliate fee and advertising revenues in local currencies for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was partially offset by the adverse impact of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies, primarily in latin america and europe.
for fiscal 2015, segment oibda at the cable network programming segment increased $241 million, or 5%, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by higher expenses of $1,259 million, or 16%, as compared to fiscal 2014. operating expenses increased approximately $1 billion for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. approximately two-thirds of the increase during fiscal 2015 was due to the continued investment in new sports channels, including star sports' broadcast of the icc cricket world cup matches, new events broadcast on fs1, including mlb games and national association of stock car auto racing ("nascar") sprint cup series races, and the effect of the acquisition of the majority interest in the yes network. the balance of the increase was primarily related to higher programming costs at fx and the rsns. the increase at fx was a result of the continued investment in new shows, including the acquisition of the simpsons, and at the rsns as a result of contractual rate increases for professional sports rights. selling, general and administrative expenses increased for fiscal 2015 by approximately $255 million, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to transaction losses on foreign currency exchange movements at fng international, the continued investment in star's sports and general entertainment channels and the effect of the acquisitions of the majority interest in the yes network in february 2014 and true[x] in february 2015. the increase in segment oibda for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was net of decreases of approximately $220 million due to strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies.
television (17% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2015 and 2014)
for fiscal 2015, revenues at the television segment decreased $401 million, or 8%, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to lower advertising revenue partially offset by higher affiliate fee revenue. advertising revenue decreased 14% for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the comparative effect of revenues of approximately $350 million arising from the broadcast of super bowl xlviii in february 2014. also contributing to the decrease were lower general entertainment primetime ratings at fox and the effect of fewer mlb league championship playoff games and nascar sprint cup series races being broadcast on fox as the events were shifted to fs1. partially offsetting these decreases were higher political advertising revenue related to the 2014 mid-term elections, higher rates for the broadcast of the nfl regular season and the broadcasts of the 2015 u.s. open golf championship and the fédération internationale de football association ("fifa") women's world cup events. affiliate fee revenue increased as a result of higher retransmission consent rates for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.
for fiscal 2015, segment oibda at the television segment decreased $164 million, or 19%, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the revenue decreases noted above partially offset by lower expenses of $237 million, or 5%, as compared to fiscal 2014. operating expenses decreased approximately $210 million for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the comparative effect of the broadcast of super bowl xlviii and the effect of sporting events, mainly mlb league championship playoff games, shifting from fox to fs1. partially offsetting these decreases were the effect of the new nfl broadcast agreement and the broadcasts of the 2015 u.s. open golf championship and the fifa women's world cup events.
filmed entertainment (33% and 30% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively)
for fiscal 2015, revenues at the filmed entertainment segment decreased $154 million, or 2%, as compared to fiscal 2014. the decrease in revenues was primarily due to the effect of the disposition of shine group in december 2014 and lower network and syndication revenues from the licensing of television productions, including the effect of the series finale of how i met your mother in fiscal 2014, partially offset by higher worldwide theatrical, home entertainment and digital distribution revenues of motion picture productions. fiscal 2015 revenues included the worldwide theatrical, home entertainment and pay television releases of dawn of the planet of the apes, maze runner and gone girl, the worldwide theatrical and home entertainment releases of how to train your dragon 2, kingsman: the secret service and night at the museum: secret of the tomb, as compared to fiscal 2014, which included the worldwide theatrical releases of x-men: days of future past and rio 2 and the worldwide theatrical,
49
home entertainment and pay television performance of the wolverine and the heat. also contributing to the decrease in revenues was the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies of approximately $200 million for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.
for fiscal 2015, segment oibda at the filmed entertainment segment increased $87 million, or 6%, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to lower expenses of $241 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2014. operating expenses decreased approximately $160 million for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the disposition of shine group in december 2014 and lower amortization related to television productions partially offset by higher motion picture production amortization and participation costs. selling, general and administrative expenses decreased for fiscal 2015 by approximately $80 million, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the disposition of shine group in december 2014. the increase in segment oibda for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was net of a decrease of approximately $130 million due to strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies, primarily in europe.
in december 2014, the company disposed of its interests in shine group by contributing it into endemol shine core joint venture. for fiscal 2015, revenues and segment oibda related to the shine group decreased approximately $600 million and $50 million, respectively, as compared to fiscal 2014.
direct broadcast satellite television (7% and 19% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively)
in november 2014, the company sold its interests in sky italia and sky deutschland (see note 3 - acquisitions, disposals and other transactions to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "sky italia and sky deutschland"). as a result, for fiscal 2015, revenues and segment oibda at the dbs segment decreased $3,918 million, or 65%, and $190 million, or 45%, respectively, as compared to fiscal 2014.
liquidity and capital resources current financial condition the company's principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds. the company also has an unused $1.4 billion revolving credit facility, which expires in may 2020, and has access to various film co-financing alternatives to supplement its cash flows. in addition, the company has access to the worldwide capital markets, subject to market conditions. as of june 30, 2016, the company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the revolving credit facility, and it does not anticipate any violation of such covenants. the company's internally generated funds are highly dependent upon the state of the advertising markets and public acceptance of its film and television productions.
as of june 30, 2016, the company's consolidated assets included $4.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $1 billion was held by the company's foreign subsidiaries. the company earns income outside the u.s., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign jurisdictions. the company does not currently intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. should the company require more capital in the u.s. than is generated by or available to its domestic operations, the company could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions which, for certain balances, may result in higher effective tax rates and higher cash paid for income taxes for the company.
the principal uses of cash that affect the company's liquidity position include the following: investments in the production and distribution of new motion pictures and television programs; the acquisition of rights and related payments for entertainment and sports programming; operational expenditures including employee costs; capital expenditures; interest expenses; income tax payments; investments in associated entities; dividends; acquisitions; debt repayments; and stock repurchases.
in addition to the acquisitions, sales and possible acquisitions disclosed elsewhere, the company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. such
50
transactions may be material and may involve cash, the company's securities or the assumption of additional indebtedness.

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations          $3,048          $3,617
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily reflects a payment at the cable network programming segment to the board of control for cricket in india for contract termination costs related to a program rights contract for the champions league twenty20 cricket tournament through 2018.

net cash (used in) provided by investing activities from continuing operations       $(1,638     )          $6,736
the change in net cash (used in) provided by investing activities during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was primarily due to the comparative effect of the cash proceeds from the sale of the dbs businesses in november 2014.
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2016 and 2015 was as follows (in millions):
for the years ended june 30,                          2016                2015

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations       $(5,330     )       $(7,102     )
the decrease in net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was primarily due to less cash used for share repurchases and higher cash from net borrowings. also contributing to the decrease was the effect of cash used in connection with the company's acquisition of sky's noncontrolling interest in ngc international in november 2014 compared to the cash used in connection with the company's acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in a rsn in february 2016.
stock repurchase program see note 12 - stockholders' equity to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "stock repurchase program".

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily reflects lower tax payments and, at the filmed entertainment segment, higher receipts for theatrical and television productions. these improvements were partially offset by the absence of cash flows due to the sale of the dbs businesses in november 2014.

the company also has certain contractual arrangements in relation to certain subsidiaries and investees that would require the company to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur ("contingent guarantees"). the company does not expect that these contingent guarantees will result in any material amounts being paid by the company in the foreseeable future. the timing of the amounts presented in the table below reflect when the maximum contingent guarantees will expire and does not indicate that the company expects to incur an obligation to make payments during that time frame.

pension and other postretirement benefits and uncertain tax benefits the table excludes the company's pension, other postretirement benefits ("opeb") obligations and the gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing. the company made contributions of $195 million and $174 million to its pension plans in fiscal
54
2016 and 2015, respectively. the majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to improve the funding status of the plans. future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, interest rates and statutory requirements. assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company's expected plan returns in fiscal 2017 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the company would not be required to make any material contributions to its u.s. pension plans for the immediate future. required pension plan contributions for the next fiscal year are not expected to be material but the company may make voluntary contributions in future periods. payments due to participants under the company's pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts. payments due under the company's opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the company's pension plans. the company does not expect its net opeb payments to be material in fiscal 2017 (see note 16 - pension and other postretirement benefits to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox for further discussion of the company's pension and opeb plans).

critical accounting policies an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the company's financial condition and results and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the company's board of directors. for the company's summary of significant accounting policies, see note 2 - summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox.
use of estimates see note 2 - summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "use of estimates".
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fees are fixed or determinable, the product or service has been delivered and collectability is reasonably assured. the company considers the terms of each arrangement to determine the appropriate accounting treatment.
cable network programming, television and direct broadcast satellite television advertising revenue is recognized as the commercials are aired, net of agency commissions. subscriber fees received from mvpds for cable network programming and television are recognized as affiliate fee revenue in the period services are provided. direct broadcast satellite television subscription and pay-per-view revenues are recognized when programming is broadcast to subscribers, while fees for equipment rental are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
the company classifies the amortization of cable distribution investments (capitalized fees paid to mvpds to facilitate carriage of a cable network) against affiliate fee revenue in accordance with asc 605-50, "revenue recognition-customer payments and incentives." the company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
55
filmed entertainment content revenues from the distribution of motion pictures and television series are recognized in accordance with asc 926. revenues from the theatrical distribution of motion pictures are recognized as they are exhibited, and revenues from home entertainment sales, net of a reserve for estimated returns, are recognized on the date that dvd and blu-ray units are made widely available for sale by retailers or when made available for viewing via digital distribution platforms and all company-imposed restrictions on the sale or availability have expired. revenues from television distribution are recognized when the motion picture or television series is made available to the licensee for broadcast.
license agreements for the broadcast of motion pictures and television series in the broadcast network, syndicated television and cable television markets are routinely entered into in advance of their available date for broadcast. cash received and amounts billed in connection with such contractual rights for which revenue is not yet recognizable is classified as deferred revenue. because deferred revenue generally relates to contracts for the licensing of motion pictures and television series which have already been produced, the recognition of revenue for such completed product is principally only dependent upon the commencement of the availability period for broadcast under the terms of the related licensing agreement.
the company earns and recognizes revenues as a distributor on behalf of third parties. in such cases, determining whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on management's assessment of whether the company acts as the principal or agent in the transaction. to the extent the company acts as the principal in a transaction, revenues are reported on a gross basis. determining whether the company acts as principal or agent in a transaction involves judgment and is based on an evaluation of whether the company has the substantial risks and rewards of ownership under the terms of an arrangement.
filmed entertainment costs and programming rights filmed entertainment costs accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in accordance with asc 926, which requires management's judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program or its license period. these judgments are used to determine the amortization of capitalized filmed entertainment and television programming costs, the expensing of participation and residual costs associated with revenues earned and any fair value adjustments.
in accordance with asc 926, the company amortizes filmed entertainment and television programming costs using the individual-film-forecast method. under the individual-film-forecast method, such programming costs are amortized for each film or television program in the ratio that current period actual revenue for such title bears to management's estimated ultimate revenue as of the beginning of the current fiscal year to be recognized over approximately a six year period from all media and markets for such title. management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each motion picture on the historical performance of similar motion pictures, incorporating factors such as the past box office record of the lead actors and actresses, the genre of the motion picture, pre-release market research (including test market screenings), the expected number of theaters in which the motion picture will be released and, once released, actual results of each motion picture. for each television program, management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue on the performance of the television programming in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell additional episodes of the program and the past performance of similar television programs. management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its total revenue estimates on a title-by-title basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write-down of the asset to fair value.
programming costs costs incurred in acquiring program rights or producing programs are accounted for in accordance with asc 920, "entertainment-broadcasters." program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun, the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing. television broadcast network entertainment programming and cable network entertainment programming, which includes acquired series, series produced in-house, movies and other programs,
56
are amortized on an accelerated or straight-line basis, as appropriate. management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its total revenue estimates on a contract basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write-down of the asset to fair value.
as a result of the evaluation of the recoverability of the unamortized costs associated with programming rights, the company recognized impairment charges of $92 million and $270 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, for entertainment programming rights principally relating to programming that it will no longer broadcast (see note 6 - inventories, net to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox for further discussion).
the company has single and multi-year contracts for broadcast rights of programs and sporting events. the costs of multi-year national sports contracts at fox and the national sports channels are charged to expense and allocated to segments based on the ratio of each current period's attributable revenue for each contract to the estimated total remaining attributable revenue for each contract. estimates can change and accordingly, are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted as necessary. such changes in the future could be material. the recoverability of certain sports rights contracts for content broadcast on fox and the national sports channels is assessed on an aggregate basis.
the costs of local and regional sports contracts for a specified number of events are amortized on an event-by-event basis while costs for local and regional sports contracts for a specified season are amortized over the season on a straight-line basis.
goodwill and intangible assets the company's intangible assets include goodwill, film and television libraries, federal communications commission ("fcc") licenses, mvpd affiliate agreements and relationships and trademarks and other copyrighted products. intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. goodwill is recorded as the difference between the consideration transferred to acquire entities and the estimated fair values assigned to their tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment. the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of intangible assets acquired, their reporting unit, as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income.
the company accounts for its business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles. amounts recorded as goodwill are assigned to one or more reporting units. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill. the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method.
carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment in accordance with asc 350 "intangibles-goodwill and other." the company's impairment review is based on, among other methods, a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment. the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired.
the company uses direct valuation methods to value identifiable intangibles for acquisition accounting and impairment testing. the direct valuation method used for fcc licenses requires, among other inputs, the use of published industry data that are based on subjective judgments about future advertising revenues in the markets where the company owns television stations. this method also involves the use of management's judgment in
57
estimating an appropriate discount rate reflecting the risk of a market participant in the u.s. broadcast industry. the resulting fair values for fcc licenses are sensitive to these long-term assumptions and any variations to such assumptions could result in an impairment to existing carrying values in future periods and such impairment could be material.
during fiscal 2016, the company determined that the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of twenty-first century fox as of june 30, 2016 were not impaired. the company determined there are no reporting units with goodwill considered to be at risk and will continue to monitor its goodwill and intangible assets for possible future impairment.
see note 10 - goodwill and intangible assets, net to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "annual impairment review" for further discussion.
income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. the company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining the company's tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties under asc 740, "income taxes".
the company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. in making this assessment, management analyzes future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, the company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income.
employee costs the measurement and recognition of costs of the company's pension and opeb plans require the use of significant management judgments, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation and other actuarial assumptions.
the company participates in and/or sponsors various pension, savings and postretirement benefit plans covering a significant number of its employees and retirees. the major pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are closed to new participants (with the exception of groups covered by collective bargaining agreements). in fiscal 2016 and 2015, the company settled a portion of its pension obligations by irrevocably transferring pension liabilities to an insurance company through the purchase of group annuity contracts and through lump sum distributions. these purchases, funded with pension plan assets, resulted in pre-tax settlement losses related to the recognition of accumulated deferred actuarial losses of $75 million and $245 million which was included in other, net in the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.
for financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate, an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality. the company considers current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, in making these assumptions. in developing the expected long-term rate of return, the company considered the pension portfolio's future return expectations of the various asset classes. the expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 49% equity securities, 27% fixed income securities and 24% in other investments. the mortality assumptions reflect data from the mortality table released by the society of actuaries in fiscal 2015 and subsequently updated in fiscal 2016.
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments on the company's annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year. the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be
58
effectively settled. the rate was determined by matching the company's expected benefit payments for the primary plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred high-quality non-callable corporate bonds.
beginning in fiscal 2017, the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans which is not expected to have a material impact on the company's pension and postretirement net periodic benefit expense in future periods (see note 16 - pension and other postretirement benefits to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox for further discussion).
the key assumptions used in developing the company's fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 net periodic pension expense for its plans consist of the following:

the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the u.s. and europe as of the measurement date. the company will utilize a weighted average discount rate of 3.8% in calculating the fiscal 2017 net periodic pension expense for its plans. the company will use a weighted average long-term rate of return of 6.9% for fiscal 2017 based principally on future return expectation of the plans' asset mix. the accumulated net pre-tax losses on the company's pension plans as of june 30, 2016 were $724 million which increased from $609 million as of june 30, 2015. this increase of $115 million was primarily due to changes in discount rates partially offset by the settlement of pension liabilities due to the purchase of annuities which resulted in a recognition of deferred losses. the accumulated pre-tax net losses as of june 30, 2016 were primarily the result of changes in discount rates. lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company's deferred losses and also increase subsequent-year pension expense. higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the company's accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequent-year pension expense. these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with asc 715, "compensation-retirement benefits." unrecognized losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans' projected benefit obligation ("pbo") are recognized over the average future service of the plan participants or average future life of the plan participants.
the company made contributions of $195 million, $174 million and $100 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to improve the funding status of the plans which were impacted by the economic conditions noted above. future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, statutory requirements and interest rate movements. assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the company's expected plan returns in fiscal 2017 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the company would not be required to make any material statutory contributions to its primary u.s. pension plans for the immediate future. the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve funded status.
59
changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in the company's expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company's pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant:

item  1a. risk factors we are substantially dependent on revenues from our principal products.
our current revenues depend upon continued sales of our principal products, and, unless we develop or acquire rights to new products and technologies, we may be substantially dependent on sales from our principal products for many years. further, following the completion of the spin-off of our hemophilia business, our revenues will be further reliant and concentrated on sales of our ms products in an increasingly competitive market, and revenue from sales of our product for spinal muscular atrophy. any of the following negative developments relating to any of our principal products may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations or could cause a decline in our stock price:
•   safety or efficacy issues;
•   the introduction or greater acceptance of competing products;
•   constraints and additional pressures on product pricing or price increases, including those resulting from governmental or regulatory requirements, increased competition, or changes in, or implementation of, reimbursement policies and practices of payors and other third parties; or
•   adverse legal, administrative, regulatory or legislative developments.
spinraza was recently approved by the fda, and is in the early stages of commercial launch. in addition to risks associated with new product launches and the other factors described in these "risk factors", our ability to successfully commercialize spinraza may be adversely affected due to:
•   our limited marketing experience within the spinal muscular atrophy market, which may impact our ability to develop relationships with the associated medical and scientific community;
•   the lack of readiness of healthcare providers to treat patients with spinal muscular atrophy;
•   the effectiveness of our commercial strategy for marketing spinraza; and
•   our ability to maintain a positive reputation among patients, healthcare providers and others in the spinal muscular atrophy community, which may be impacted by pricing and reimbursement decisions relating to spinraza.
if we fail to compete effectively, our business and market position would suffer.
the biopharmaceutical industry and the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. we compete in the marketing and sale of our products, the development of new products and processes, the acquisition of rights to new products with commercial potential and the hiring and retention of personnel. we compete with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that have a greater number of products on the market and in the product pipeline, greater financial and other resources and other technological or competitive advantages. one or more of our competitors may benefit from significantly greater sales and marketing capabilities, may develop products that are accepted more widely than ours or may receive patent protection that dominates, blocks or adversely affects our product development or business.
our products are also susceptible to competition from generics and biosimilars in many markets. generic versions of drugs and biosimilars are likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than branded products. accordingly, the introduction of generic or biosimilar versions of our marketed products likely would significantly reduce both the price that we receive for such marketed products and the volume of products that we sell, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
in the ms market, we face intense competition as the number of products and competitors continues to expand. due to our significant reliance on sales of our ms products, our business may be harmed if we are unable to successfully compete in the ms market. more specifically, our ability to compete, maintain and grow our share in the ms market may be adversely affected due to a number of factors, including:
•   the introduction of more efficacious, safer, less expensive or more convenient alternatives to our ms products, including our own products and products of our collaborators;
•   the introduction of lower-cost biosimilars, follow-on products or generic versions of branded ms products sold by our competitors, and the possibility of future competition from generic versions or prodrugs of existing therapeutics or from off-label use by physicians of therapies indicated for other conditions to treat ms patients;
29
•   patient dynamics, including the size of the patient population and our ability to attract new patients to our therapies;
•   damage to physician and patient confidence in any of our ms products or to our sales and reputation as a result of label changes or adverse experiences or events that may occur with patients treated with our ms products;
•   inability to obtain appropriate pricing and reimbursement for our ms products compared to our competitors in key international markets; or
•   our ability to obtain and maintain patent, data or market exclusivity for our ms products.
sales of our products depend, to a significant extent, on adequate coverage, pricing and reimbursement from third-party payors, which are subject to increasing and intense pressure from political, social, competitive and other sources. our inability to maintain adequate coverage, or a reduction in pricing or reimbursement, could have an adverse effect on our business, revenues and results of operations and could cause a decline in our stock price.
sales of our products are dependent, in large part, on the availability and extent of coverage, pricing and reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. when a new pharmaceutical product is approved, the availability of government and private reimbursement for that product may be uncertain, as is the pricing and amount for which that product will be reimbursed.
pricing and reimbursement for our products may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:
•   changes in, and implementation of, federal, state or foreign government regulations or private third-party payors' reimbursement policies;
•   pressure by employers on private health insurance plans to reduce costs; and
•   consolidation and increasing assertiveness of payors, including managed care organizations, health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, seeking price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies and, in some cases, the imposition of restrictions on access or coverage of particular drugs or pricing determined based on perceived value.
our ability to set the price for our products can vary significantly from country to country and as a result so can the price of our products. certain countries set prices by reference to the prices in other countries where our products are marketed. thus, our inability to secure adequate prices in a particular country may not only limit the revenue from our products within that country, but may also adversely affect our ability to obtain acceptable prices in other markets. this may create the opportunity for third-party cross-border trade or influence our decision to sell or not to sell a product, thus adversely affecting our geographic expansion plans and revenues.
our failure to maintain adequate coverage, pricing, or reimbursement for our products would have an adverse effect on our business, revenues and results of operations, could curtail or eliminate our ability to adequately fund research and development programs for the discovery and commercialization of new products and could cause a decline in our stock price.
drug prices are under significant scrutiny in the markets in which our products are prescribed. we expect drug pricing and other health care costs to continue to be subject to intense political and societal pressures on a global basis. as a result, our business and reputation may be harmed, our stock price may be adversely impacted and experience periods of volatility, and our results of operations may be adversely impacted.
30
our results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare reforms.
in the u.s., federal and state legislatures, health agencies and third-party payors continue to focus on containing the cost of health care. legislative and regulatory proposals and enactments to reform health care insurance programs could significantly influence the manner in which our products are prescribed and purchased. for example, provisions of the ppaca have resulted in changes in the way health care is paid for by both governmental and private insurers, including increased rebates owed by manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program, annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, the requirement that manufacturers participate in a discount program for certain outpatient drugs under medicare part d and the expansion of the number of hospitals eligible for discounts under section 340b of the public health service act. these changes have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our business. in 2017, we may face uncertainties as a result of likely federal and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ppaca. there is no assurance that the ppaca, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.
there is also significant economic pressure on state budgets that may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for our drugs. in recent years, some states have considered legislation and ballot initiatives that would control the prices of drugs, including laws to allow importation of pharmaceutical products from lower cost jurisdictions outside the u.s. and laws intended to impose price controls on state drug purchases. state medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental rebates are not being paid. government efforts to reduce medicaid expenses may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by medicaid programs. this may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding constraint on prices and reimbursement for our products.
in the e.u. and some other international markets, the government provides health care at low cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored health care system. many countries have announced or implemented measures to reduce health care costs to constrain their overall level of government expenditures. these measures vary by country and may include, among other things, patient access restrictions, suspensions on price increases, prospective and possibly retroactive price reductions and other recoupments and increased mandatory discounts or rebates, recoveries of past price increases and greater importation of drugs from lower-cost countries to higher-cost countries. these measures have negatively impacted our revenues, and may continue to adversely affect our revenues and results of operations in the future.
adverse safety events or restrictions on use and safety warnings for our products can negatively affect our business, product sales and stock price.
adverse safety events involving our marketed products may have a negative impact on our business. discovery of safety issues with our products could create product liability and could cause additional regulatory scrutiny and requirements for additional labeling or safety monitoring, withdrawal of products from the market and the imposition of fines or criminal penalties. adverse safety events may also damage physician and patient confidence in our products and our reputation. any of these could result in liabilities, loss of revenue, material write-offs of inventory, material impairments of intangible assets, goodwill and fixed assets, material restructuring charges and other adverse impacts on our results of operations.
regulatory authorities are making greater amounts of stand-alone safety information directly available to the public through periodic safety update reports, patient registries and other reporting requirements. the reporting of adverse safety events involving our products or products similar to ours and public rumors about such events may increase claims against us and may also cause our product sales or stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility.
restrictions on use or significant safety warnings that may be required to be included in the label of our products, such as the risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml), a serious brain infection, in the label for certain of our products, may significantly reduce expected revenues for those products and require significant expense and management time.
31
if we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection for our data, intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. the degree of patent protection that will be afforded to our products and processes in the u.s. and in other important markets remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices, courts, administrative bodies and lawmakers in these countries. we can provide no assurance that we will successfully obtain or preserve patent protection for the technologies incorporated into our products and processes, or that the protection obtained will be of sufficient breadth and degree to protect our commercial interests in all countries where we conduct business. if we cannot prevent others from exploiting our inventions, we will not derive the benefit from them that we currently expect. furthermore, we can provide no assurance that our products will not infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties.
we also rely on regulatory exclusivity for protection of our products. implementation and enforcement of regulatory exclusivity, which may consist of regulatory data protection and market protection, varies widely from country to country. failure to qualify for regulatory exclusivity, or failure to obtain or maintain the extent or duration of such protections that we expect in each of the markets for our products due to challenges, changes or interpretations in the law or otherwise, could affect our revenue for our products or our decision on whether to market our products in a particular country or countries or could otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews or other proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. we may also face challenges to our patent and regulatory protections covering our products by third parties, including manufacturers of generics and biosimilars that may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our patent or regulatory exclusivity. litigation, interference, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. the outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements. an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products. furthermore, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products and services.
our long-term success depends upon the successful development of new products and additional indications for existing products.
our long-term viability and growth will depend upon successful development of additional indications for our existing products as well as successful development of new products and technologies from our research and development activities, our biosimilars joint venture with samsung biologics or licenses or acquisitions from third parties.
product development is very expensive and involves a high degree of risk. only a small number of research and development programs result in the commercialization of a product. clinical trials may indicate that our product candidates lack efficacy, have harmful side effects, result in unexpected adverse events or raise other concerns that may significantly reduce the likelihood of regulatory approval. this may result in terminated programs, significant restrictions on use and safety warnings in an approved label, adverse placement within the treatment paradigm, or significant reduction in the commercial potential of the product candidate.
clinical trials and the development of biopharmaceutical products is a lengthy and complex process. if we fail to adequately manage our clinical activities, our clinical trials or potential regulatory approvals may be delayed or denied.
conducting clinical trials is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. our ability to complete clinical trials in a timely fashion depends in large part on a number of key factors. these factors include protocol design, regulatory and institutional review board approval, patient enrollment rates and compliance with extensive current good clinical practices. if we or our third-party clinical trial providers or third-party contract research organizations (cros) do not successfully carry out these clinical activities, our clinical trials or the potential regulatory approval of a product candidate may be delayed or be unsuccessful.
32
we have opened clinical sites and are enrolling patients in a number of countries where our experience is more limited. in most cases, we use the services of third parties to carry out our clinical trial related activities and rely on such parties to accurately report their results. our reliance on third parties for these activities may impact our ability to control the timing, conduct, expense and quality of our clinical trials. one cro has responsibility for a substantial portion of our clinical trial related activities and reporting. if this cro does not adequately perform, many of our trials may be affected. we may need to replace our cros. although we believe there are a number of other cros we could engage to continue these activities, the replacement of an existing cro may result in the delay of the affected trials or otherwise adversely affect our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize our product candidates.
successful preclinical work or early stage clinical trials do not ensure success in later stage trials, regulatory approval or commercial viability of a product.
positive results in a trial may not be replicated in subsequent or confirmatory trials. additionally, success in preclinical work or early stage clinical trials does not ensure that later stage or larger scale clinical trials will be successful or that regulatory approval will be obtained. in addition, even if later stage clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may delay or decline approval of our product candidates. regulatory authorities may disagree with our view of the data, require additional studies or disagree with our trial design or endpoints. regulatory authorities may also fail to approve the facilities or the processes used to manufacture a product candidate, our dosing or delivery methods or companion devices. regulatory authorities may grant marketing approval that is more restricted than anticipated. these restrictions may include limiting indications to narrow patient populations and the imposition of safety monitoring, educational requirements and risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. the occurrence of any of these events could result in significant costs and expenses, have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility.
even if we are able to successfully develop new products or indications, sales of new products or products with additional indications may not meet investor expectations. we may also make a strategic decision to discontinue development of a product or indication if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to the standard of care or other opportunities in our pipeline.
management and key personnel changes may disrupt our operations, and we may have difficulty retaining key personnel or attracting and retaining qualified replacements on a timely basis for management and other key personnel who may leave the company.
we have experienced changes in management and other key personnel in critical functions across our organization, including our chief executive officer, and heads of research and development and pharmaceutical operations and technology. changes in management and other key personnel have the potential to disrupt our business, and any such disruption could adversely affect our operations, programs, growth, financial condition and results of operations. further, new members of management may have different perspectives on programs and opportunities for our business, which may cause us to focus on new business opportunities or reduce or change emphasis on our existing business programs.
our success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management and key personnel in a highly competitive environment. qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them, particularly at the executive level. we may face difficulty in attracting and retaining key talent for a number of reasons, such as management changes, the underperformance or discontinuation of one or more late stage programs or recruitment by competitors. we cannot assure that we will be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary for our operations or that the loss of any such personnel will not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
manufacturing issues could substantially increase our costs, limit supply of our products and reduce our revenues.
the process of manufacturing our products is complex, highly regulated and subject to numerous risks, including:
•   risk of product loss. the manufacturing process for our products is extremely susceptible to product loss due to contamination, oxidation, equipment failure or improper installation or operation of equipment, or vendor or operator error. even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. if microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our products or manufacturing facilities, we may need to close our manufacturing facilities for an extended period of time to investigate and remediate the contaminant.
33
•   risks of reliance on third parties and single source providers. we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers for many aspects of our manufacturing process for our products and product candidates. in some cases, due to the unique manner in which our products are manufactured, we rely on single source providers of several raw materials and manufacturing supplies. these third parties are independent entities subject to their own unique operational and financial risks that are outside of our control. these third parties may not perform their obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner or in compliance with applicable regulations, and they may be unable or unwilling to increase production capacity commensurate with demand for our existing or future products. finding alternative providers could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the specialized nature of the services and the need to obtain regulatory approval of any significant changes to our suppliers or manufacturing methods. we cannot be certain that we could reach agreement with alternative providers or that the fda or other regulatory authorities would approve our use of such alternatives.
•   global bulk supply risks. we rely on our principal manufacturing facilities for the production of drug substance for our large molecule products and product candidates. our global bulk supply of these products and product candidates depends on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities, which could be adversely affected by equipment failures, labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures and numerous other factors.
•   risks relating to compliance with cgmp. we and our third-party providers are generally required to maintain compliance with cgmp and other stringent requirements and are subject to inspections by the fda and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to pass any regulatory agency inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products. significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of monetary penalties or other civil or criminal sanctions and damage our reputation.
any adverse developments affecting our manufacturing operations or the operations of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the commercial supply of our products. we may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. such developments could increase our manufacturing costs, cause us to lose revenue or market share as patients and physicians turn to competing therapeutics, diminish our profitability or damage our reputation.
we depend on relationships with collaborators and other third-parties for revenue, and the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of certain products, which are outside of our full control.
we rely on a number of significant collaborative relationships for revenue, and the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of certain of our products and product candidates. we also outsource to third parties certain aspects of our regulatory affairs and clinical development relating to our products and product candidates. reliance on collaborative and other third-party relationships subjects us to a number of risks, including:
•   we may be unable to control the resources our collaborators or third parties devote to our programs or products;
•   disputes may arise under the agreement, including with respect to the achievement and payment of milestones or ownership of rights to technology developed with our collaborators or other third parties, and the underlying contract with our collaborators or other third parties may fail to provide significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if the collaborators or third parties fail to perform;
•   the interests of our collaborators or third parties may not always be aligned with our interests, such parties may not pursue regulatory approvals or market a product in the same manner or to the same extent that we would, which could adversely affect our revenues;
•   third-party relationships and collaborations often require the parties to cooperate, and failure to do so effectively could adversely affect product sales, or the clinical development or regulatory approvals of products under joint control or could result in termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates or result in litigation or arbitration; and
34
•   any failure on the part of our collaborators or other third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements in the marketing, sale and maintenance of the marketing authorization of our products or to fulfill any responsibilities our collaborators or other third parties may have to protect and enforce any intellectual property rights underlying our products could have an adverse effect on our revenues as well as involve us in possible legal proceedings.
given these risks, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts. if these efforts fail, our product development or commercialization of new products could be delayed or revenues from products could decline.
our business may be adversely affected if we do not successfully execute our growth initiatives.
we anticipate growth through internal development projects, commercial initiatives and external opportunities, which may include the acquisition, partnering and in-licensing of products, technologies and companies or the entry into strategic alliances and collaborations. while we believe we have a number of promising programs in our pipeline, failure of internal development projects to advance or difficulties in executing on our commercial initiatives could impact our current and future growth, resulting in additional reliance on external development opportunities for growth. the availability of high quality, cost-effective development opportunities is limited and competitive, and we are not certain that we will be able to identify candidates that we and our shareholders consider suitable or complete transactions on terms that are acceptable to us and our shareholders. we may fail to complete transactions for other reasons, including if we are unable to obtain desired financing on favorable terms, if at all. even if we are able to successfully identify and complete acquisitions and other strategic alliances and collaborations, we may face unanticipated costs or liabilities in connection with the transaction or we may not be able to integrate them or take full advantage of them or otherwise realize the benefits that we expect.
supporting our growth initiatives and the further development of our existing products and potential new products in our pipeline will require significant capital expenditures and management resources, including investments in research and development, sales and marketing, manufacturing capabilities and other areas of our business. if we do not successfully manage our growth initiatives, then our business and financial results may be adversely affected and we may incur asset impairment or restructuring charges.
we may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation and distribution of bioverativ.
on february 1, 2017, we distributed all of the then outstanding shares of bioverativ common stock to biogen stockholders in connection with the separation of our hemophilia business. in connection with the distribution, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements (including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, a manufacturing and supply agreement, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement and certain other commercial agreements). these agreements govern the separation and distribution and the relationship between the two companies going forward, including with respect to potential tax-related losses associated with the separation and distribution. they also provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time (including under the manufacturing and supply agreement pursuant to which we will manufacture and supply certain products and materials to bioverativ).
there could be significant liability if the separation and distribution is determined to be a taxable transaction. bioverativ has agreed to indemnify us for certain potential liabilities that may arise, but we cannot guarantee that bioverativ will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations.
the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make bioverativ financially responsible for many liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the distribution, including any pending or future litigation. it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and bioverativ and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to bioverativ. third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations, and the indemnity rights we have under the separation and distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations. even if we are successful in obtaining indemnification, we may have to bear costs temporarily. in addition, our indemnity obligations to bioverativ may be significant. these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
35
the separation of bioverativ continues to involve a number of risks, including, among other things, the indemnification risks described above and the potential that management's and our employees' attention will be significantly diverted by the provision of transitional services. certain of the agreements described above provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time. if bioverativ is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur losses. these arrangements could also lead to disputes over rights to certain shared property and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations. our inability to effectively manage the separation activities and related events could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation and distribution, and such events may adversely affect our business.
we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation and distribution, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation, or if such benefits are delayed, our business, financial condition, results of operations and the value of our stock could be adversely impacted.
a breakdown or breach of our technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.
we are increasingly dependent upon technology systems and data. our computer systems continue to increase in multitude and complexity due to the growth in our business, making them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack. likewise, data privacy or security breaches by individuals authorized to access our technology systems or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our patients, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. they are often carried out by motivated, well-resourced, skilled and persistent actors including nation states, organized crime groups and "hacktivists." cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware and key loggers, a denial-of-service attack, a malicious website, the use of social engineering and other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our technology systems and data. our key business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. while we continue to build and improve our systems and infrastructure and believe we have taken appropriate security measures to reduce these risks to our data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us. in addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.
if we fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry, we could face increased costs, penalties and a loss of business.
our activities, and the activities of our collaborators, distributors and other third-party providers, are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the u.s. and in foreign jurisdictions. the fda and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions directly regulate many of our most critical business activities, including the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies, product manufacturing, advertising and promotion, product distribution, adverse event reporting and product risk management. our interactions in the u.s. or abroad with physicians and other health care providers that prescribe or purchase our products are also subject to government regulation designed to prevent fraud and abuse in the sale and use of the products and place greater restrictions on the marketing practices of health care companies. health care companies such as ours are facing heightened scrutiny of their relationships with health care providers from anti-corruption enforcement officials. in addition, health care companies such as ours have been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government regulation, including claims asserting submission of incorrect pricing information, impermissible off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products, payments intended to influence the referral of health care business, submission of false claims for government reimbursement, antitrust violations or violations related to environmental matters. there is also enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including insurance premium and co-pay assistance programs and donations to third party charities that provide such assistance. if we, or our vendors or donation recipients, are deemed to fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or government guidance in the operation of these programs, we could be subject to significant fines or penalties. risks relating to compliance with laws and regulations may be heightened as we continue to expand our global operations and enter new therapeutic areas with different patient populations, which may have different product distribution methods, marketing programs or patient assistance programs from those we currently utilize or support.
36
regulations governing the health care industry are subject to change, with possibly retroactive effect, including:
•   new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to health care availability, pricing or marketing practices, compliance with wage and hour laws and other employment practices, method of delivery, payment for health care products and services, compliance with health information and data privacy and security laws and regulations, tracking and reporting payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, extensive anti-bribery and anti-corruption prohibitions, product serialization and labeling requirements and used product take-back requirements;
•   changes in the fda and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity;
•   requirements that provide for increased transparency of clinical trial results and quality data, such as the ema's clinical transparency policy, which could impact our ability to protect trade secrets and competitively-sensitive information contained in approval applications or could be misinterpreted leading to reputational damage, misperception or legal action which could harm our business; and
•   changes in fda and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products, or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products.
violations of governmental regulation may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions against us, including fines and civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in government programs, including medicare and medicaid, as well as against executives overseeing our business. in addition to penalties for violation of laws and regulations, we could be required to repay amounts we received from government payors, or pay additional rebates and interest if we are found to have miscalculated the pricing information we have submitted to the government. we cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies and procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees, collaborators, partners or third-party providers that would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. whether or not we have complied with the law, an investigation into alleged unlawful conduct could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, divert management time and attention and adversely affect our business.
our effective tax rate may fluctuate and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of accrued amounts.
as a global biopharmaceutical company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. as a result, our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places that we operate. in preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of such places. our effective tax rate, however, may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from country to country, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws. any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations.
in addition, our inability to secure or sustain acceptable arrangements with tax authorities and future changes in the tax laws, among other things, may result in tax obligations in excess of amounts accrued in our financial statements.
in the u.s., there are several proposals under consideration to reform tax law, including proposals that may reduce or eliminate the deferral of u.s. income tax on our unrepatriated earnings, penalize certain transfer pricing structures, and reduce or eliminate certain foreign or domestic tax credits or deductions. our future reported financial results may be adversely affected by tax law changes which restrict or eliminate certain foreign tax credits or our ability to deduct expenses attributable to foreign earnings, or otherwise affect the treatment of our unrepatriated earnings.
in addition to u.s. tax reform proposals, the adoption of some or all of the recommendations set forth in the organization for economic co-operation and development's project on "base erosion and profit shifting" (beps) by tax authorities in the countries in which we operate, could negatively impact our effective tax rate. these recommendations focus on payments from affiliates in high tax jurisdictions to affiliates in lower tax jurisdictions and the activities that give rise to a taxable presence in a particular country.
37
our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business.
our indebtedness, together with our significant contingent liabilities, including milestone and royalty payment obligations, could have important consequences to our business; for example, such obligations could:
•   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•   limit our ability to access capital markets and incur additional debt in the future;
•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including business development efforts, research and development and mergers and acquisitions; and
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.
our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.
we are increasing our presence in international markets, particularly emerging markets, subjecting us to many risks that could adversely affect our business and revenues, such as:
•   the inability to obtain necessary foreign regulatory or pricing approvals of products in a timely manner;
•   collectability of accounts receivable;
•   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, in particular the recent strength of the u.s. dollar versus foreign currencies that has adversely impacted our revenues and net income;
•   difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;
•   the imposition of governmental controls;
•   less favorable intellectual property or other applicable laws;
•   increasingly complex standards for complying with foreign laws and regulations that may differ substantially from country to country and may conflict with corresponding u.s. laws and regulations;
•   the far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation in the u.k., including the u.k. bribery act 2010, and elsewhere and escalation of investigations and prosecutions pursuant to such laws;
•   compliance with complex import and export control laws;
•   restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities and trade restrictions;
•   greater political or economic instability; and
•   changes in tax laws and tariffs.
in addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under u.s. law. for example, the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits u.s. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. in many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the foreign corrupt practices act. failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including: possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product; recalls, seizures or withdrawal of an approved product from the market; disruption in the supply or availability of our products or suspension of export or import privileges; the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions; the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations; and damage to our reputation. any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside of the u.s. could adversely impact our business and financial results.

our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations.
our quarterly revenues, expenses and net income (loss) have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to the risks described in these "risk factors" as well as the timing of charges and expenses that we may take. we have recorded, or may be required to record, charges that include:
•   the cost of restructurings;
•   impairments with respect to investments, fixed assets and long-lived assets, including in-process r&amp;d and other intangible assets;
•   inventory write-downs for failed quality specifications, charges for excess or obsolete inventory and charges for inventory write downs relating to product suspensions, expirations or recalls;
•   changes in the fair value of contingent consideration;
•   bad debt expenses and increased bad debt reserves;
•   outcomes of litigation and other legal or administrative proceedings, regulatory matters and tax matters;
•   milestone payments under license and collaboration agreements; and
•   payments in connection with acquisitions and other business development activities.
our revenues are also subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. although we have foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies, our efforts to mitigate the impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates may not be successful. as a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and the currencies in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways. our net income may also fluctuate due to the impact of charges we may be required to take with respect to foreign currency hedge transactions. in particular, we may incur higher than expected charges from hedge ineffectiveness or from the termination of a hedge relationship.
our operating results during any one period do not necessarily suggest the anticipated results of future periods.
we are pursuing opportunities to expand our manufacturing capacity for future clinical and commercial requirements for product candidates, which will result in the incurrence of significant investment with no assurance that such investment will be recouped.
while we believe we currently have sufficient large scale manufacturing capacity to meet our near-term manufacturing requirements, it is probable that we would need additional large scale manufacturing capacity to support future clinical and commercial manufacturing requirements for product candidates in our pipeline, if such candidates are successful and approved. we are building a large scale biologics manufacturing facility in solothurn, switzerland and acquired an additional manufacturing facility in research triangle park, north carolina. due to the long lead times necessary for the expansion of manufacturing capacity, we expect to incur significant investment to build or expand our facilities or obtain third-party contract manufacturers with no assurance that such investment will be recouped. if we are unable to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products and product candidates or if we do not fully utilize our manufacturing facilities, our business may be harmed.
our investment in samsung bioepis, and our success in commercializing biosimilars developed by samsung bioepis, are subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in the development, manufacture and commercialization of biosimilars.
our investment in samsung bioepis, and our success in commercializing biosimilars developed by samsung bioepis, are subject to a number of risks, including:
•   reliance on third parties. we are dependent on the efforts of samsung bioepis and other third parties over whom we have limited or no control in the development and manufacturing of biosimilars products. if samsung bioepis or such other third parties fail to perform successfully, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our investment in samsung bioepis;
•   regulatory compliance. biosimilar products may face regulatory hurdles or delays due to the evolving and uncertain regulatory and commercial pathway of biosimilars products in certain jurisdictions;
39
•   intellectual property and regulatory challenges. biosimilar products may face extensive patent clearances, patent infringement litigation, injunctions or regulatory challenges, which could prevent the commercial launch of a product or delay it for many years;
•   failure to gain market and patient acceptance. market success of biosimilar products will be adversely affected if patients, physicians and payers do not accept biosimilar products as safe and efficacious products offering a more competitive price or other benefit over existing therapies;
•   ability to provide adequate supply. manufacturing biosimilars is complex. if we encounter any manufacturing or supply chain difficulties, we may be unable to meet higher than anticipated demand; and
•   competitive challenges. biosimilar products face significant competition, including from innovator products and from biosimilar products offered by other companies. in some jurisdictions, local tendering processes may restrict biosimilar products from being marketed and sold in those jurisdictions. the number of competitors in a jurisdiction, the timing of approval and the ability to market biosimilar products successfully in a timely and cost-effective matter are additional factors that may impact our success and/or the success of samsung bioepis in this business area.
our investments in properties may not be fully realized.
we own or lease real estate primarily consisting of buildings that contain research laboratories, office space and manufacturing operations. for strategic or other operational reasons, we may decide to further consolidate or co-locate certain aspects of our business operations or dispose of one or more of our properties, some of which may be located in markets that are experiencing high vacancy rates and decreasing property values. if we determine that the fair value of any of our owned properties is lower than their book value we may not realize the full investment in these properties and incur significant impairment charges or additional depreciation when the expected useful lives of certain assets have been shortened due to the anticipated closing of facilities. if we decide to fully or partially vacate a leased property, such as ceasing manufacturing at our facility in cambridge, massachusetts, we may incur significant cost, including facility closing costs, employee separation and retention expenses, lease termination fees, rent expense in excess of sublease income and impairment of leasehold improvements and accelerated depreciation of assets. any of these events may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
our portfolio of marketable securities is subject to market, interest and credit risk that may reduce its value.
we maintain a portfolio of marketable securities for investment of our cash. changes in the value of our portfolio of marketable securities could adversely affect our earnings. in particular, the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates, downgrades of the bonds and other securities included in our portfolio, instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities included in our portfolio, declines in the value of collateral underlying the securities included in our portfolio and other factors. each of these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio or sell investments for less than our acquisition cost. although we attempt to mitigate these risks through diversification of our investments and continuous monitoring of our portfolio's overall risk profile, the value of our investments may nevertheless decline.
there can be no assurance that we will continue to repurchase stock or that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices.
from time to time our board of directors authorizes stock repurchase programs, including most recently a $5.0 billion stock repurchase program in july 2016. the amount and timing of stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and our determination that stock repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and our agreements applicable to the repurchase of stock. our ability to repurchase stock will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, results of operations, financial condition and other factors beyond our control that we may deem relevant. a reduction in, or the completion or expiration of, our stock repurchase programs could have a negative effect on our stock price. we can provide no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices, if at all.
40
we may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us.
we may seek access to the capital markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements and other business initiatives. the capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption which leads to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. in the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on favorable terms. changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our cost of financing and the market price of our securities.
our business involves environmental risks, which include the cost of compliance and the risk of contamination or injury.
our business and the business of several of our strategic partners involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biologics and radioactive compounds. although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with state, federal and foreign standards, there will always be the risk of accidental contamination or injury. if we were to become liable for an accident, or if we were to suffer an extended facility shutdown, we could incur significant costs, damages and penalties that could harm our business. manufacturing of our products and product candidates also requires permits from government agencies for water supply and wastewater discharge. if we do not obtain appropriate permits, including permits for sufficient quantities of water and wastewater, we could incur significant costs and limits on our manufacturing volumes that could harm our business.
the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or stolen products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.
third parties might illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or unfit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing, distribution and testing standards. a patient who receives a counterfeit or unfit drug may be at risk for a number of dangerous health consequences. our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or unfit drugs sold under our brand name. stolen inventory that is not properly stored or sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business. in addition, inventory that is stolen from warehouses, plants or while in-transit, and that is subsequently improperly stored and sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business.
the increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.
social media is increasingly being used to communicate about our products and the diseases our therapies are designed to treat. social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear. this evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. for example, patients may use social media channels to comment on the effectiveness of a product or to report an alleged adverse event. when such disclosures occur, there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend the company or the public's legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our products. there is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. if any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face overly restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business.
some of our collaboration agreements contain change in control provisions that may discourage a third party from attempting to acquire us.
some of our collaboration agreements include change in control provisions that could reduce the potential acquisition price an acquirer is willing to pay or discourage a takeover attempt that could be viewed as beneficial to shareholders. upon a change in control, some of these provisions could trigger reduced milestone, profit or royalty payments to us or give our collaboration partner rights to terminate our collaboration agreement, acquire operational control or force the purchase or sale of the programs that are the subject of the collaboration.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page f-1 of this report. certain totals may not sum due to rounding.
executive summary introduction biogen is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering therapies to people living with serious neurological, rare and autoimmune diseases.
our marketed products include tecfidera, avonex, plegridy, tysabri, zinbryta and fampyra for multiple sclerosis (ms), fumaderm for the treatment of severe plaque psoriasis and spinraza for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (sma). we also have certain business and financial rights with respect to rituxan for the treatment of non-hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) and other conditions, gazyva indicated for the treatment of cll and follicular lymphoma, and other potential anti-cd20 therapies under a collaboration agreement with genentech, inc. (genentech), a wholly-owned member of the roche group.
in may 2016 we announced our intention to spin off our hemophilia business, bioverativ inc. (bioverativ), as an independent, publicly traded company. bioverativ will focus on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies for the treatment of hemophilia and other blood disorders, including eloctate for the treatment of hemophilia a and alprolix for the treatment of hemophilia b. bioverativ will also assume all of our rights and obligations under our collaboration agreement with swedish orphan biovitrum ab (sobi) and our collaboration and license agreement with sangamo biosciences inc. (sangamo).
on february 1, 2017, we completed the distribution of all the then outstanding shares of common stock of bioverativ to biogen stockholders, who received one share of bioverativ common stock for every two shares of biogen common stock. as a result of the distribution, bioverativ is now an independent public company whose shares of common stock are trading under the symbol "bivv"
on the nasdaq global select market.
the financial results of bioverativ are included in our consolidated results of operations and financial position in our audited consolidated financial statements for the periods presented in this form 10-k. the financial results of bioverativ will be excluded from our consolidated results of operations and financial position commencing february 1, 2017. for additional information regarding the separation of bioverativ, please read note 26, subsequent events to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
our current revenues depend upon continued sales of our principal products and, unless we develop, acquire rights to, and commercialize new products and technologies, we may be substantially dependent on sales from our principal products for many years. further, following the completion of the spin-off of our hemophilia business, our revenues will be further reliant and concentrated on sales of our ms products in an increasingly competitive market.
in the longer term, our revenue growth will be dependent upon the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and launch of new commercial products as well as additional indications for our existing products, our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other rights related to our marketed products, assets originating from our research and development efforts and successful execution of external business development opportunities.
we support our drug discovery and development efforts through the commitment of significant resources to discovery, research and development programs and business development opportunities, particularly within areas of our scientific, manufacturing and technical capabilities. for nearly two decades we have led in the research and development of new therapies to treat ms, resulting in our leading portfolio of ms treatments. now our research is focused on additional improvements in the treatment of ms, such as, the development of next generation therapies for ms with a goal to reverse or possibly repair damage caused by the disease. we are also applying our scientific expertise to solve some of the most challenging and complex diseases, including alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als), and are employing innovative technologies to discover potential treatments for rare and genetic disorders, including new ways of treating diseases through gene therapy.
our innovative drug development and commercialization activities are complemented by our biosimilar therapies that expand access to medicines and reduce the cost burden for healthcare systems. we are leveraging our manufacturing capabilities and know-how by developing, manufacturing and marketing

biosimilars through samsung bioepis, our joint venture with samsung biologics co. ltd. (samsung biologics). under our commercial agreement with samsung bioepis, we market and sell benepali, an etanercept biosimilar referencing enbrel, and flixabi, an infliximab biosimilar referencing remicade, in the european union (e.u.).
financial highlights diluted earnings per share attributable to biogen inc. were $16.93 for 2016, representing an increase of 10.4% over the same period in 2015.
as described below under "results of operations," our income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2016, reflects the following:
•   total revenues were $11,448.8 million for 2016, representing an increase of 6.4% over the same period in 2015.
•   product revenues, net totaled $9,817.9 million for 2016, representing an increase of 6.8% over the same period in 2015. this increase was driven by a 9.1% increase in worldwide tecfidera revenues, a 52.8% increase in worldwide hemophilia revenues, a 4.1% increase in worldwide tysabri revenues and revenues from benepali. these increases are partially offset by a 5.8% decrease in worldwide interferon revenues. product revenues, net for
2016, compared to the same period in 2015, were also negatively impacted by a $167.8 million decrease in hedge gains recognized under our foreign currency hedging program in comparative periods.
•   revenues from anti-cd20 therapeutic programs totaled $1,314.5 million for 2016, representing a decrease of 1.8% over the same period in 2015.
•   other revenues totaled $316.4 million for 2016, representing an increase of 34.0% from the same period in 2015. this increase was primarily driven by an increase in other corporate revenues, which includes amounts earned with respect to our contract manufacturing activities.
•   total cost and expenses totaled $6,298.4 million for 2016, representing an increase of 7.2%, compared to the same period in 2015. this increase was driven by a $454.8 million litigation settlement and license charge and a 19.2% increase in cost of sales, which includes a charge of $45.5 million for accelerated depreciation as a result of the determination to cease manufacturing in cambridge, ma and vacate our biologics manufacturing facility in cambridge, ma and warehouse space in somerville, ma. these increases were partially offset by a 7.8% decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and a decrease in restructuring charges.
we generated $4,522.4 million of net cash flows from operations for 2016, which were primarily driven by earnings. cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $7,724.5 million as of december 31, 2016.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we repurchased and retired approximately 3.3 million shares of common stock at a cost of $1.0 billion under our share repurchase programs.
collaborative and other relationships in may 2016 we entered into a collaboration and alliance with the university of pennsylvania (upenn) to advance gene therapy and gene editing technologies. for additional information related to this transaction, please read note 19, collaborative and other relationships to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
49
restructuring and cost saving initiatives during the third quarter of 2016 we initiated cost saving measures primarily intended to realign our organizational structure due to the changes in roles and workforce resulting from our decision to spin off our hemophilia business, and to achieve further targeted cost reductions.
additionally, in connection with the transaction to sublease our rights to the manufacturing facility in cambridge, ma to brammer bio ma, llc (brammer), certain employees were separated from biogen.
for additional information related to our restructuring and cost saving initiatives, please read note 3, restructuring, business transformation and other cost saving initiatives to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
business environment the biopharmaceutical industry and the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. many of our competitors are working to develop or have commercialized products similar to those we market or are developing. in addition, the commercialization of certain of our own approved ms products, products of our collaborators and pipeline product candidates may negatively impact future sales of our existing ms products. our products may also face increased competitive pressures from the introduction of generic versions, prodrugs of existing therapeutics or biosimilars of existing products and other technologies, such as gene therapies and bispecific antibodies.
in addition, sales of our products are dependent, in large part, on the availability and extent of coverage, pricing and reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. drug prices are under significant scrutiny in the markets in which our products are prescribed. drug pricing and other health care costs continue to be subject to intense political and societal pressures.
for additional information related to our competition and pricing risks that could negatively impact our product sales, please read the "risk factors" section of this report.

multiple sclerosis (ms)
tecfidera for 2016 compared to 2015, the increase in u.s. tecfidera revenues was primarily due to price increases, partially offset by higher discounts and allowances and a decrease in unit sales volume of 1%.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the increase in u.s. tecfidera revenues was primarily due to increases in unit sales volume of 13% as tecfidera penetrated the u.s. market, and increases in gross price partially offset by higher discounts and allowances.
for 2016 compared to 2015, the increase in rest of world tecfidera revenues was primarily due to increases in unit sales volume of 32% in existing markets and new markets where we continue to launch the product and expand our presence around the world. these increases were partially offset by pricing reductions in certain european countries. rest of world tecfidera revenues for 2016, compared to 2015, were also negatively impacted by a $50.2 million decrease in hedge gains recognized under our foreign currency hedging program in the comparative period.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the increase in rest of world tecfidera revenues was primarily due to increases in unit sales volume in existing markets and in new markets as we continue to launch the product and expand our presence around the world. these increases were partially offset by pricing reductions in germany as described below. rest of world tecfidera revenues for 2015, compared to 2014, were also negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange losses totaling $74.1 million. these foreign currency exchange losses were partially offset by comparative net gains recognized under our foreign currency hedging program totaling $47.5 million.
51
under german legislation related to the pricing of new drug products introduced in the german market, pricing is unregulated for the first 12 months after launch. we launched tecfidera in germany in february 2014 and our unregulated pricing ended in the first quarter of 2015, at which time we began recognizing revenue at the fixed price established through our negotiations with the german regulatory authorities. the negotiated annual price is fixed for three years.
we anticipate relatively stable demand for tecfidera in 2017 on a global basis, with patient growth in our international markets offsetting modest patient declines in the u.s. primarily resulting from increasing competition from additional treatments and product candidates for ms, including ocrevus.
interferon avonex and plegridy for 2016, 2015 and 2014, u.s. avonex revenues totaled $1,675.3 million, $1,790.2 million and $1,956.7 million, respectively.
for 2016, 2015 and 2014, u.s. plegridy revenues totaled $305.0 million, $227.1 million and $27.8 million, respectively.
for 2016 compared to 2015, the decrease in u.s. interferon revenues was primarily due to an overall decrease in interferon unit sales volume of 10%, which was attributable to a decrease in avonex unit sales volume primarily due to patients transitioning to other oral ms therapies, as well as higher discounts and allowances. these decreases were partially offset by price increases.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the increase in u.s. interferon revenues was primarily due to gross price increases for avonex and an increase in plegridy unit sales volume as sales of plegridy began in the u.s. in fourth quarter of 2014. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in avonex unit sales volume of 17%, which was attributable in part to patients transitioning to other oral ms therapies, including tecfidera.
for 2016, 2015 and 2014 rest of world avonex revenues totaled $638.2 million, $840.0 million and $1,056.4 million, respectively.
for 2016, 2015 and 2014, rest of world plegridy revenues totaled $176.7 million, $111.4 million and $16.7 million, respectively.
for 2016 compared to 2015, the decrease in rest of world interferon revenues was primarily due to pricing reductions in certain european countries and an overall decrease in avonex unit sales volume of 10% due primarily to patients transitioning to other oral ms therapies, including tecfidera. rest of world interferon revenues for 2016, compared to 2015, were also negatively impacted by a $66.1 million decrease in hedge gains recognized under our hedging program in the comparative period.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the decrease in rest of world interferon revenues was due to a decrease in avonex unit sales volume of 11% primarily in europe attributable to patients transitioning to other oral ms therapies, including tecfidera. these increases were partially offset by an increase in plegridy unit sales volume as sales of plegridy began in the e.u. in the third quarter of 2014. rest of world interferon revenues for 2015, compared to 2014, were also negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange losses of $153.1 million. these foreign currency exchange losses were partially offset by comparative net gains recognized under our foreign currency hedging program of $58.4 million.
we expect that overall interferon revenues will continue to decline as a result of competition from our other products as well as other ms therapies.
52
tysabri for 2016 compared to 2015, the increase in u.s. tysabri revenues was primarily due to an increase in unit sales volume of 4% and increases in price, partially offset by higher discounts and allowances.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the increase in u.s. tysabri revenues was primarily due to an increase in unit sales volume of 4% and increases in gross price, partially offset by higher discounts and allowances.
for 2016 compared to 2015, the slight decrease in rest of world tysabri revenues was primarily due to the impact of a $46.1 million decrease in hedge gains recognized under our hedging program in the comparative period. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in unit sales volume of 8%, primarily in europe.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the decrease in rest of world tysabri revenues was due to pricing reductions in some european countries and the prior year recognition of $53.5 million of revenue previously deferred in italy relating to the pricing agreement with the italian national medicines agency (agenzia italiana del farmaco or aifa) as discussed below.
rest of world tysabri revenues for 2015, compared to 2014, were negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange losses of $136.3 million. these foreign currency exchange losses were partially offset by comparative net gains recognized under our foreign currency hedging program of $45.9 million.
in the fourth quarter of 2011 biogen italia srl, our italian subsidiary, received a notice from aifa that sales of tysabri after mid-february 2009 exceeded a reimbursement limit established pursuant to a price determination resolution (price resolution) granted by aifa in december 2006. in january 2017, we negotiated an agreement in principle with aifa's price and reimbursement committee to settle all of aifa's existing claims relating to sales of tysabri in excess of the reimbursement limit for the periods from february 2009 through january 2013 for an aggregate repayment of eur37.4 million. the agreement is subject to ratification by aifa. if this most recent settlement agreement is accepted, we could recognize approximately eur42 million in revenue upon resolution of this matter. for information regarding our agreement with aifa relating to sales of tysabri in italy, please read note 17, other consolidated financial statement detail to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
we anticipate relatively stable demand for tysabri in 2017 on a global basis, with patient growth in our international markets offsetting modest patient declines in the u.s. primarily resulting from increasing competition from additional treatments and product candidates for ms, including zinbryta and ocrevus.
zinbryta under the terms of our collaboration agreement with abbvie, we began to recognize revenues on sales of zinbryta to third parties in the e.u. in the third quarter of 2016.

revenues from anti-cd20 therapeutic programs genentech (roche group)
our share of rituxan and gazyva operating profits are summarized as follows:
biogen's share of pre-tax profits in the u.s. for rituxan and gazyva the following table provides a summary of amounts comprising our share of pre-tax profits on rituxan and gazyva in the u.s.:
for the years endeddecember 31,
(in millions)                                   2016                    2015                    2014

pre-tax profits in the u.s.            $3,197.3                $3,174.2                $2,785.5
biogen's share of pre-tax profits      $1,249.5                $1,269.8                $1,117.1
our share of rituxan pre-tax profits in the u.s. decreased to 39% from 40% as gazyva was approved by the fda in follicular lymphoma in february 2016.
for 2016 compared to 2015, the increase in u.s. product revenues was primarily due to an increase in gazyva unit sales volume of 41%, an increase in rituxan unit sales of 1% and selling price increases, partially offset by higher rituxan discounts and allowances.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the increase in u.s. product revenues was primarily due to a 4% increase in rituxan unit sales volume and selling price increases, partially offset by higher discounts and allowances.
collaboration costs and expenses for 2016 compared to 2015 increased primarily due to an increase in rituxan product cost of sales.
collaboration costs and expenses for 2015 compared to 2014 decreased primarily due to the 2014 recognition of $53.9 million of additional branded pharmaceutical drug (bpd) fee expense as well as lower rituxan cost of sales, partially offset by higher gazyva sales and marketing expenses. during 2014 the internal revenue service issued final regulations related to the bpd fee, which had the effect of changing the recognition of the fee for accounting purposes, from the period in which the fee was paid, to the period when the sale occurs. as a result of these final regulations, we recognized an incremental bpd fee in 2014 for the periods 2013 through the end of the third quarter of 2014. the final regulations did not change the timing of payments.

other royalty and corporate revenues
56
royalty revenues we receive royalties from net sales on products related to patents that we have out-licensed. prior to 2015, our most significant source of royalty revenue had been derived from net worldwide sales of angiomax, which was out-licensed to the medicines company. on december 15, 2014 we ceased recognizing royalty revenues from u.s. sales of angiomax, contemporaneous with the u.s. patent's expiration.
for 2016 compared to 2015, royalty revenues were relatively consistent.
for 2015 compared to 2014, royalty revenues decreased primarily due to the expiration of u.s. patent rights that gave rise to royalty payments related to angiomax.
other corporate revenues our corporate partner revenues include amounts earned under contract manufacturing agreements.
for 2016 compared to 2015, as well as 2015 compared to 2014, to the increase in other corporate revenues was primarily due to higher contract manufacturing revenues related to drug substance manufacturing provided to a strategic partner.
reserves for discounts and allowances revenues from product sales are recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances, including those associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain international markets where we operate.
these reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). our estimates take into consideration our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. if actual results vary, we adjust these estimates, which will have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.
reserves for discounts, contractual adjustments and returns that reduced gross product revenues are summarized as follows:
for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, reserves for discounts and allowances as a percentage of gross product revenues were 21.3%, 19.3% and 16.6%, respectively.
discounts discounts include trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives.
for 2016 compared to 2015, the increase in discounts was primarily driven by increases in gross selling price, contractual discount rates and volume related to our hemophilia products.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the increase in discounts was primarily driven by our recent product additions, gross price increases and increases in contractual rates contractual adjustments contractual adjustments relate to medicaid and managed care rebates, co-payment assistance (copay), veterans administration (va), public health service (phs) discounts, specialty pharmacy program fees and other government rebates or applicable allowances.
for 2016 compared to 2015, the increase in contractual adjustments was primarily due to higher medicaid and other governmental rebates and allowances in the u.s. and managed care rebates, due in part to an increase in gross selling prices.
57
for 2015 compared to 2014, the increase in contractual adjustments was primarily due to our recent product additions, higher medicaid and other governmental rebates and allowances in the u.s. and managed care rebates as a result of an increase in contracted business and gross prices.
returns product return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalers. in accordance with contractual terms, wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product. the majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration. provisions for product returns are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to product sales.
for 2016 compared to 2015, and 2015 compared to 2014, return reserves decreased primarily due to a reduction in return rates based on recent experiences of returned products.

cost of sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets (cost of sales)
product cost of sales for 2016 compared to 2015, the increase in product cost of sales was primarily driven by increased contract manufacturing shipments and higher unit sales volume related to our biosimilars and hemophilia products, partially offset by favorable production costs and mix of products.
product cost of sales for 2016 also reflects the recognition of $45.5 million of accelerated depreciation as a result of the determination to cease manufacturing in cambridge, ma and vacate our biologics manufacturing facility in cambridge, ma and warehouse space in somerville, ma.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the increase in product cost of sales was primarily driven by increased contract manufacturing production and higher unit sales volume of our marketed products, including newly launched products.
inventory amounts written down as a result of excess, obsolescence, unmarketability or other reasons totaled $48.2 million, $41.9 million and $50.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
royalty cost of sales for 2016 compared to 2015, the increase in royalty cost of sales was primarily driven by the increase in royalty rates payable to sobi, increased sales of our hemophilia products and higher royalties on sales of avonex and plegridy in the u.s., partially offset by a decrease in tysabri royalties due to the expiration of certain third party royalties.
on june 28, 2016, the u.s. patent and trademark office issued to the japanese foundation for cancer research (jfcr) a patent related to recombinant interferon-beta protein. this patent, u.s. patent no. 9,376,478, expires in june 2033. this patent was issued following an interference proceeding between jfcr and us. this patent is relevant to avonex and plegridy, and we will pay royalties in the mid-single digits in relation to this patent during the life of the patent.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the increase in royalty cost of sales was primarily driven by the increase in royalties due to sobi on increased sales of our hemophilia products and an increase in the contractual rate of tysabri contingent payments due to perrigo company plc (perrigo), which is based on the expected level of annual worldwide net sales of tysabri, partially offset by a decrease in tysabri revenues and the expiration of certain third-party royalties related to tysabri.
for additional information on our relationship with sobi, please read note 19, collaborative and other relationships to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

research and development
60
research and development expense incurred in support of our marketed products includes costs associated with product lifecycle management activities including, if applicable, costs associated with the development of new indications for existing products. late stage programs are programs in phase 3 development or in registration stage. early stage programs are programs in phase 1 or phase 2 development. research and discovery represents costs incurred to support our discovery research and translational science efforts. other research and development costs consist of indirect costs incurred in support of overall research and development activities and non-specific programs, including activities that benefit multiple programs, such as management costs as well as depreciation and other facility-based expenses. costs are reflected in the development stage based upon the program status when incurred. therefore, the same program could be reflected in different development stages in the same year. for several of our programs, the research and development activities are part of our collaborative and other relationships. our costs reflect our share of the total costs incurred.
for 2016 compared to 2015, the decrease in research and development expense was primarily related to decreases in costs incurred in connection with our early stage programs, marketed products and other research and development costs. these decreases were partially offset by increased costs incurred in connection with our late stage programs and research and discovery.
the decrease in spending associated with our early stage programs for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the advancement of our aducanumab program for alzheimer's disease to a late stage program in the third quarter of 2015, decreased costs incurred in connection with opicinumab in ms and the discontinuance of development of anti-tweak in lupus nephritis. these decreases were partially offset by increased costs of biib074 (formerly known as raxatrigine) in trigeminal neuralgia (tgn) and increased costs associated with our discontinuance of development of amiselimod in the third quarter of 2016.
the decrease in spending associated with our marketed products for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the discontinuance of development of tysabri and tecfidera in secondary primary multiple sclerosis (spms) in the third and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively, and decreased costs incurred in connection with our hemophilia products. these decreases were partially offset by the approvals of zinbryta and spinraza in the third and fourth quarters of 2016, respectively.
the increase in spending associated with our late stage programs for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by costs incurred to advance our aducanumab program for alzheimer's disease, the increased costs incurred to advance our spinraza program for the treatment of sma and the advancement of e2609 to a late stage program in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by the approval of zinbryta in the third quarter of 2016.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the increase in research and development expense was primarily related to increases in costs incurred in connection with our late and early stage programs and research and discovery, partially offset by a decrease in milestone and upfront expenses and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of $34.0 million.
the increase in spending associated with our late stage programs for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily driven by costs incurred to advance our aducanumab program for alzheimer's disease and the spinraza program for the treatment of sma, partially offset by a decrease in costs related to zinbryta and the approvals of plegridy and eloctate in 2014.
the increase in spending associated with our early stage programs for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to costs incurred in connection with our aducanumab program for alzheimer's disease, which advanced to a late stage program during the third quarter of 2015, the ban2401 program for alzheimer's disease related to our collaboration with eisai and our biib074 program for tgn. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in costs incurred in connection with the spinraza program for the treatment of sma as the program advanced to a late stage program during the first quarter of 2015.
we intend to continue committing significant resources to targeted research and development opportunities where there is a significant unmet need and where the drug candidate has the potential to be highly differentiated. specifically, we intend to continue to invest in our ms pipeline, our aducanumab program, the ban2401 and e2609 programs and our biib074 program.
61
milestone and upfront expenses included in research and development expense research and development expense for 2016 includes a $75.0 million license fee paid to ionis as we exercised our option to develop and commercialize spinraza from ionis, a $50.0 million milestone payment due to eisai related to the initiation of a phase 3 trial for e2609 and a $20.0 million upfront milestone paid to the upenn upon entering into a collaboration and alliance. for additional information about these transactions, please read note 19, collaborative and other relationships to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
research and development expense for 2015 includes $60.0 million recorded upon entering into our collaboration with mitsubishi tanabe pharma corporation (mtpc), $48.1 million recorded upon entering into our collaboration with applied genetic technologies corporation (agtc), $30.0 million recorded as milestones in relation to our collaboration agreements with ionis and $16.0 million paid to abbvie related to milestones for the development of zinbryta as a result of filing with the fda and ema during the year. for additional information about these transactions, please read note 19, collaborative and other relationships to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
research and development expense for 2014 includes $139.3 million recorded in connection with our collaboration agreement with eisai co., ltd. (eisai), $25.0 million recorded as milestones in relation to our collaboration agreements with ionis and an aggregate of $60.0 million related to upfront payments made to sangamo and google inc. and for other strategic business arrangements.
these payments are classified as research and development expense as the programs they relate to had not achieved regulatory approval as of the payment date.
selling, general and administrative for 2016 compared to 2015, the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses reflects cost savings in connection with our corporate restructuring, which are described below under the heading "restructuring charges," partially offset by an increase in costs associated with developing commercial capabilities for zinbryta and spinraza.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was driven by a decrease in corporate giving, incentive compensation and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of $87.6 million, partially offset by an increase of $38.9 million of bpd fee expense.
amortization of acquired intangible assets our amortization expense is based on the economic consumption of intangible assets. our most significant intangible assets are related to our avonex and tysabri products. annually, during our long-range planning cycle, we perform an analysis of anticipated lifetime revenues of avonex and tysabri.
62
our most recent long range planning cycle was completed in the third quarter of 2016. based upon this analysis, the estimated future amortization of acquired intangible assets is expected to be as follows:
(in millions)       as of december 31, 2016
2017              $334.8
2018               312.7
2019               295.2
2020               259.7
2021               242.8
we monitor events and expectations regarding product performance. if new information indicates that the assumptions underlying our most recent analysis are substantially different than those utilized in our current estimates, our analysis would be updated and may result in a significant change in the anticipated lifetime revenues of the relevant process. the occurrence of an adverse event could substantially increase the amount of amortization expense associated with our acquired intangible assets as compared to previous periods or our current expectations, which may result in a significant negative impact on our future results of operations.
for 2016 compared to 2015, the amortization of acquired intangible assets was relatively consistent as our most recent analysis completed during the third quarter of 2016 resulted in no significant net change in our expected rate of amortization for acquired intangible assets.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets was primarily driven by a decrease in avonex revenues during the comparative periods and the impact of higher expected lifetime revenues of avonex due to a slower than previously expected adoption of plegridy. amortization of acquired intangible assets during 2014 included total impairment charges of $50.9 million related to one of our out-licensed patents and one of our in-process research and development (ipr&d) intangible assets.
for additional information related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets, please read note 6, intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
impairment of intangible assets we record charges associated with impairments of intangible assets in amortization of intangible assets.
during 2016 we terminated our collaboration agreements with rodin therapeutics, inc. and ataxion inc., resulting in impairment losses of $8.7 million and $3.5 million, respectively, related to the ipr&d assets recorded upon entering into the collaboration agreements.
impairment charges related to our intangible assets during 2015 were insignificant.
during 2014 we recorded a charge of $34.7 million related to the impairment of one of our out-licensed patents to reflect a change in its estimated fair value, due to a change in the underlying competitive market for that product.
during 2014 we updated the probabilities of success related to the early stage programs acquired through our recent acquisitions. this change in probability of success, combined with a delay in one of the projects, resulted in an impairment loss of $16.2 million.
for additional information, please read note 6, intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
ipr&d overall, the value of our acquired ipr&d assets is dependent upon a number of variables, including estimates of future revenues and the effects of competition, the level of anticipated development costs and the probability and timing of successfully advancing a particular research program from a clinical trial phase to the next. we are continually reevaluating our estimates concerning these variables and evaluating industry data regarding the productivity of clinical research and the development process. changes in our estimates of items may result in a significant change to our valuation of these assets.
the field of developing treatments for forms of neuropathic pain, such as tgn, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) are highly competitive and can be affected by changes to expected market candidates and changes in timing and the clinical development of our product candidates. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop biib074 for the treatment of tgn or stx-100 for the treatment of ipf, or other indications or that a successfully developed therapy will be able to secure sufficient pricing in a competitive market. changes to clinical development plans or life cycle management strategies are evaluated regularly. we review amounts
63
capitalized as acquired ipr&d for impairment at least annually, as of october 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets might not be recoverable. our most recent impairment assessment as of october 31, 2016 resulted in no impairments.
restructuring, business transformation and other cost saving initiatives
2015 cost saving initiatives
2015 restructuring charges on october 21, 2015, we announced a corporate restructuring, which included the termination of certain pipeline programs and an 11% reduction in workforce. as a result of these initiatives, we reduced our annual run rate of operating expenses by $250 million and reinvested these savings to support the advancement of our high potential pipeline candidates and key commercial activities.
under this restructuring, cash payments were estimated to total $120 million, of which $15.9 million were related to previously accrued 2015 incentive compensation, resulting in net restructuring charges totaling approximately $102.0 million. these amounts were substantially incurred and paid by the end of 2016.
for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized total net restructuring charges of $8.0 million and $93.4 million, respectively.
the following table summarizes the charges and spending related to our 2015 restructuring program during 2016:

2016 organizational changes and cost saving initiatives
2016 restructuring charges during the third quarter of 2016 we initiated additional cost saving measures primarily intended to realign our organizational structure due to the changes in roles and workforce resulting from our decision to spin off our hemophilia business, and to achieve further targeted cost reductions. for 2016 we recognized charges totaling $17.7 million related to this effort, which are in addition to, and separate from, the 2015 corporate restructuring described above. these amounts, which were substantially incurred and paid by the end of 2016, are primarily related to severance and are reflected in restructuring charges in our consolidated statements of income.
cambridge, ma manufacturing facility in june 2016 following an evaluation of our current and future manufacturing capabilities and capacity needs, we determined that we intend to vacate and cease manufacturing in our 67,000 square foot small-scale biologics manufacturing facility in cambridge, ma and also vacate our 46,000 square foot warehouse space in somerville, ma.
in december 2016 we subleased our rights to the manufacturing facility in cambridge, ma to brammer. brammer also purchased from us certain manufacturing equipment, leasehold improvements and other assets in exchange for shares of brammer common llc interests and assumed manufacturing operations effective january 1, 2017. in december 2016 we also closed and vacated our warehouse space in somerville, ma.
64
our departure from these facilities shortened the expected useful lives of certain leasehold improvements and other assets at these facilities. as a result, we recorded additional depreciation expense to reflect the assets' new shorter useful lives. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized approximately $45.5 million of this additional depreciation, which was recorded as cost of sales in our consolidated statement of income.
under the terms of the agreement, brammer will also provide manufacturing and other transition and support services to us.
in the fourth quarter of 2016 we recognized charges totaling $7.4 million for severance costs related to certain employees separated from biogen in connection with this transaction. these amounts will be substantially incurred and paid by the end of the first quarter of 2017 and are reflected in restructuring charges in our consolidated statements of income.
(gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration the consideration for certain of our business combinations includes future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular factor or factors. we record an obligation for such contingent consideration payments at fair value on the acquisition date. we then revalue our contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations, other than changes due to payments, are recognized as a (gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration in our consolidated statements of income.
the loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration for 2016 was primarily due to changes in the probability of achieving certain developmental milestones and changes in the discount rate.
the loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration for 2015 was primarily due to changes in the expected timing and probabilities of success related to the achievement of certain developmental milestones and in the discount rate.
the gain on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration for 2014 was primarily due to an adjustment to the value of our contingent consideration liabilities as we updated the probabilities of success related to the early stage programs acquired through our recent acquisitions. for additional information, please read note 7, fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
collaboration profit (loss) sharing collaboration profit (loss) sharing includes our 50% share of the profit or loss related to our biosimilars commercial agreement with samsung bioepis and our 50% share of the co-promotion profits or losses in the e.u. and canada related to our collaboration agreement with abbvie on the commercialization of zinbryta.
we began to recognize revenues on sales of biosimilars in the first quarter of 2016. for 2016 we recognized net expense of $15.1 million related to our biosimilars commercial agreement with samsung.
we began to recognize revenues on sales of zinbryta in the e.u. in the third quarter of 2016. for 2016 we also recognized income of $4.9 million to reflect abbvie's 50% share of net collaboration losses in the e.u. and canada.
for additional information related to these arrangements, please read note 19, collaborative and other relationships to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

tecfidera litigation settlement and license charges in january 2017 we agreed to enter into a settlement and license agreement with forward pharma a/s (forward pharma) that will provide us an irrevocable license to all intellectual property owned by forward pharma and results in the termination of the german infringement litigation. under the terms of the settlement and license agreement with forward pharma, we have agreed to pay forward pharma $1.25 billion in cash. during the fourth quarter of 2016 we recognized a pre-tax charge of $454.8 million related to this matter. this amount represents the fair value of estimated royalties on our sales of tecfidera during the period april 2014 through december 31, 2016. for additional information related to the agreement, please read note 21, commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
other income (expense), net for 2016 compared to 2015, the change in other income (expense), net was primarily due to an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in the third quarter of 2015. this increase was partially offset by an increase in interest income on higher yields and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as well as a decrease in foreign exchange losses recognized during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the prior year comparative period.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the change in other income (expense), net was primarily due to an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in the third quarter of 2015, higher foreign exchange losses and a decrease in net gains recognized on the sale of our strategic investments and marketable securities.
for additional information related to our senior unsecured notes, please read note 11, indebtedness, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
66
income tax provision our effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the global nature of our operations. the factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate include variability in the allocation of our taxable earnings among multiple jurisdictions, changes in tax laws, the amount and characterization of our research and development expenses, the levels of certain deductions and credits, acquisitions and licensing transactions.
our effective tax rate for 2016 compared to 2015 increased primarily due to a net state tax benefit in 2015 of $27.0 million resulting from the remeasurement of one of our uncertain tax positions and a higher relative percentage of our earnings being attributed to the u.s., a higher tax jurisdiction.
our effective tax rate for 2015 compared to 2014 benefited from lower anticipated taxes on foreign earnings and reflects a $27.0 million benefit from the 2015 remeasurement of one of our uncertain tax positions.
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for more information on our uncertain tax positions and income tax rate reconciliation for 2016, 2015 and 2014, please read note 16, income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
equity in loss of investee, net of tax in february 2012 we entered into an agreement with samsung biologics, establishing an entity, samsung bioepis, to develop, manufacture and market biosimilar pharmaceuticals. we account for this investment under the equity method of accounting. we recognize our share of the results of operations related to our investment in samsung bioepis one quarter in arrears.
during 2015 our share of losses exceeded the carrying value of our investment. we therefore suspended recognizing additional losses and will continue to do so unless we commit to providing additional funding.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the decrease in our equity in loss of investee, net of tax, was due to the suspension of equity method investment losses due to our share of losses exceeding the carrying value of our investment in 2015 and a decrease in our ownership interest.
for additional information related to this transaction, please read note 19, collaborative and other relationships to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
noncontrolling interest for 2016 compared to 2015, the change in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax, was primarily related to a $60.0 million milestone payment made to neurimmune subone ag (neurimmune) in 2015.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the change in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax, was primarily related to a $60.0 million milestone payment made to neurimmune, partially offset by increases in research expenses attributable to noncontrolling interests.
for additional information about neurimmune, please read note 18, investments in variable interest entities to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

overview we have historically financed our operating and capital expenditures primarily through cash flows earned through our operations. we expect to continue funding our current and planned operating requirements principally through our cash flows from operations, as well as our existing cash resources. we believe that our existing funds, when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to additional financing resources, if needed, are sufficient to satisfy our operating, working capital, strategic alliance, milestone payment, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. in addition, we may choose to opportunistically return cash to shareholders and pursue other business initiatives, including acquisition and licensing activities. we may, from time to time, also seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements, strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources should we identify a significant new opportunity.
the undistributed cumulative foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries, exclusive of earnings that would result in little or no net income tax expense under current u.s. tax law or which has already been subject to tax under u.s. tax law, are invested indefinitely outside the u.s.
of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at december 31, 2016, approximately $5.5 billion was generated in foreign jurisdictions and is primarily intended for use in our foreign operations or in connection with business development transactions outside of the u.s. in managing our day-to-day liquidity in the u.s., we do not rely on the unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds and we have not provided for u.s. federal or state income taxes on these undistributed foreign earnings.
for additional information related to certain risks that could negatively impact our financial position or future results of operations, please read the "risk factors" and "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" sections of this report.
share repurchase programs in july 2016 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock (2016 share repurchase program). this authorization does not have an expiration date. repurchased shares will be retired. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we repurchased and retired 3.3 million shares of common stock at a cost of $1.0 billion under our 2016 share repurchase program.
in may 2015 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock (2015 share repurchase program), which was completed as of december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2015, we repurchased and retired approximately 16.8 million shares of common stock at a cost of $5.0 billion under our 2015 share repurchase program.
in february 2011 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 20.0 million of our common stock (2011 share repurchase program), which has been used principally to offset common stock issuances under our share-based compensation plans. the 2011 share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. we did not repurchase any shares of common stock under our 2011 share repurchase program during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we purchased approximately 2.9 million shares of common stock at a cost of $886.8 million under our 2011 share repurchase program. we have approximately 1.3 million shares remaining available for repurchase under the 2011 share repurchase program.
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities until required for another use in our business, we typically invest our cash reserves in bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes, u.s. and foreign government instruments and other interest bearing marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy. it is our policy to mitigate credit risk in our cash reserves and marketable securities by maintaining a well-diversified portfolio that limits the amount of exposure as to institution, maturity and investment type.
the net increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at december 31, 2016, from december 31, 2015, is primarily due to net cash flows provided by operating activities, partially offset by purchases of our common stock, payments for income taxes, contingent payments made to former shareholders of fumapharm ag and holders of their rights, the net purchases of property, plant and equipment and upfront and milestone payments related to our collaboration agreements.

borrowings the following is a summary of our principal indebtedness:
•   $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due march 1, 2018;
•   $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.90% senior notes due september 15, 2020;
•   $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.625% senior notes due september 15, 2022;
•   $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.05% senior notes due september 15, 2025; and
•   $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.20% senior notes due september 15, 2045.
these senior unsecured notes were issued at a discount and are amortized as additional interest expense over the period from issuance through maturity.
during the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a $1.0 billion, five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we are permitted to draw funds for working capital and general corporate purposes. the terms of the revolving credit facility include a financial covenant that requires us not to exceed a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. as of december 31, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings and were in compliance with all covenants under this facility.
in connection with our 2006 distribution agreement with fumedica ag (fumedica), we issued notes totaling 61.4 million swiss francs that were payable to fumedica in varying amounts from june 2008 through june 2018. our remaining note payable to fumedica had a carrying value of 6.2 million swiss francs ($6.0 million) and 8.9 million swiss francs ($9.0 million) as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
for a summary of the fair values of our outstanding borrowings as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, please read note 7, fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
working capital we define working capital as current assets less current liabilities. the increase in working capital at december 31, 2016, from december 31, 2015, reflects an increase in total current assets of $2,031.9 million, partially offset by an increase in current liabilities of $842.2 million. the increase in total current assets was primarily driven by an increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities due to net cash flows provided by operating activities. the increase in total current liabilities primarily resulted from litigation settlement and license charges and an increase in accrued collaboration expenses.
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity:

operating activities cash flows from operating activities represent the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. we expect cash provided from operating activities will continue to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.
operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for:
•   non-cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and share-based compensation charges;
•   changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations; and
70
•   changes associated with the fair value of contingent payments associated with our acquisitions of businesses and payments related to collaborations.
for 2016 compared to 2015, the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher net income, non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization, a comparative increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by a comparative increase in accounts receivable.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher net income and accounts receivable collections, partially offset by income tax payments.
investing activities for 2016 compared to 2015, the decrease in net cash flows used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in net purchases of marketable securities and cash paid for the acquisition of convergence in february 2015, partially offset by an increase in the contingent consideration related to the fumapharm ag acquisition.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the increase in net cash flows used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of marketable securities, an increase in the total amount of contingent consideration paid to the former shareholders of fumapharm ag, an increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment and cash paid for the acquisition of convergence.
financing activities for 2016 compared to 2015, the decrease in net cash flows provided by financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of our senior unsecured notes issued in the third quarter of 2015, partially offset by a decrease in the purchases of common stock.
for 2015 compared to 2014, the change in net cash flows provided by financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of our 2015 senior notes, partially offset by an increase in the amount of common stock we repurchased.
contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2016, excluding amounts related to uncertain tax positions, funding commitments, contingent development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, tysabri contingent payments and contingent consideration related to our business combinations, as described below.

(1)   during 2015 we amended our existing lease related to eisai's oral solid dose products manufacturing facility in rtp, north carolina, where we manufacture our and eisai's oral solid dose products. amounts reflected within the table above include the future contractual commitments. for additional information, please read note 10, property, plant and equipment to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
(2)   we lease properties and equipment for use in our operations. amounts reflected within the table above detail future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases as of december 31 for each of the periods presented. in addition to the minimum rental commitments, these leases may require us to pay additional amounts for taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses.

(3)   obligations are presented net of sublease income expected to be received for the vacated manufacturing facility in cambridge, ma, the vacated portion of our weston, massachusetts facility and other facilities throughout the world. for additional information related to the sublease of the vacated manufacturing facility in cambridge, ma, please read note 3, restructuring, business transformation and other cost savings initiatives to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
(4)   long-term debt obligations are primarily related to our senior notes, including principal and interest payments.
(5)   purchase and other obligations primarily includes our obligations to purchase direct materials, our obligation of $1.25 billion under the litigation settlement and license agreement with forward pharma, $176.3 million in contractual commitments for the construction of a biologics manufacturing facility in solothurn, switzerland and $13.6 million related to the fair value of net liabilities on derivative contracts. for additional information on the litigation settlement and license agreement with forward pharma please read note 21, commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
tysabri contingent payments in 2013 we acquired from elan full ownership of all remaining rights to tysabri that we did not already own or control. under the terms of the acquisition agreement, we are obligated to make contingent payments to elan of 18% on annual worldwide net sales up to $2.0 billion and 25% on annual worldwide net sales that exceed $2.0 billion. royalty payments to elan and other third parties are recognized as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income. elan was acquired by perrigo in december 2013. following that acquisition, we began making these royalty payments to perrigo.
contingent consideration related to business combinations in connection with our acquisitions of convergence, stromedix, inc. (stromedix) and biogen international neuroscience gmbh (bin), we agreed to make additional payments based upon the achievement of certain milestone events.
as the acquisitions of convergence, stromedix and bin occurred after january 1, 2009, we record contingent consideration liabilities at their fair value on the acquisition date and revalue these obligations each reporting period. we may pay up to approximately $1.2 billion in remaining milestones related to these acquisitions. for additional information related to our acquisition of convergence please read note 2, acquisitions, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
fumapharm ag in 2006 we acquired fumapharm ag. as part of this acquisition we acquired fumaderm and tecfidera (together, fumapharm products). we are required to make contingent payments to former shareholders of fumapharm ag or holders of their rights based on the attainment of certain cumulative sales levels of fumapharm products and the level of total net sales of fumapharm products in the prior twelve month period, as defined in the acquisition agreement.
during 2016 we paid $1.2 billion in contingent payments as we reached the $7.0 billion, $8.0 billion, $9.0 billion and $10.0 billion cumulative sales levels related to the fumapharm products in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first, second and third quarters of 2016, respectively, and accrued $300.0 million upon reaching $11.0 billion in total cumulative sales of fumapharm products in the fourth quarter of 2016.
we will owe an additional $300.0 million contingent payment for every additional $1.0 billion in cumulative sales level of fumapharm products reached if the prior 12 months sales of the fumapharm products exceed $3.0 billion, until such time as the cumulative sales level reaches $20.0 billion, at which time no further contingent payments shall be due. if the prior 12 months sales of fumapharm products are less than $3.0 billion, contingent payments remain payable on a decreasing tiered basis. these payments will be accounted for as an increase to goodwill as incurred, in accordance with the accounting standard applicable to business combinations when we acquired fumapharm. any portion of the payment which is tax deductible will be recorded as a reduction to goodwill. payments are due within 60 days following the end of the quarter in which the applicable cumulative sales level has been reached.
contingent development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments based on our development plans as of december 31, 2016, we could make potential future milestone payments to third parties of up to approximately $3.1 billion, including approximately $0.5 billion in development milestones, approximately $0.8 billion in regulatory milestones and approximately $1.8 billion in commercial milestones as part of our various collaborations, including licensing and development programs. payments under these agreements generally become due and payable
72
upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones. because the achievement of these milestones had not occurred as of december 31, 2016, such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements. amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval and commercial milestones.
we anticipate that we may pay approximately $157.0 million of milestone payments in 2017, provided various development, regulatory or commercial milestones are achieved.
other funding commitments as of december 31, 2016, we have several on-going clinical studies in various clinical trial stages. our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations (cros). the contracts with cros are generally cancellable, with notice, at our option. we have recorded accrued expenses of approximately $21.0 million on our consolidated balance sheet for expenditures incurred by cros as of december 31, 2016. we have approximately $500.0 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing cro contracts as of december 31, 2016.
tax related obligations we exclude liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. as of december 31, 2016, we have approximately $47.8 million of net liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions.
other off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. as such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. we consolidate variable interest entities if we are the primary beneficiary.
legal matters for a discussion of legal matters as of december 31, 2016, please read note 20, litigation to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (u.s. gaap), requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an on-going basis we evaluate our estimates, judgments and methodologies. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expenses. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
revenue recognition and related allowances we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; our price to the customer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. for additional information related to the new accounting standard for revenues from contracts with customers please read note 1, summary of significant accounting policies: new accounting pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
product revenues revenues from product sales are recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, which is typically upon delivery. product revenues are recorded net of applicable reserves for discounts and allowances. the timing of distributor orders and shipments can cause variability in earnings.
73
reserves for discounts and allowances revenues from product sales are recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances, including those associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain of the international markets in which we operate. these reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). our estimates take into consideration our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. if actual results vary, we adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.
in addition to the discounts and rebates described above and classified as a reduction of revenue, we also maintain certain customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management, data and distribution services, which are generally reflected as a reduction of revenue. to the extent we can demonstrate a separable benefit and fair value for these services, we classify these payments within selling, general and administrative expenses.
revenues from anti-cd20 therapeutic programs revenues from anti-cd20 therapeutic programs consist of:
(i)   our share of pre-tax profits and losses in the u.s. for rituxan and gazyva;
(ii)  reimbursement of our selling and development expenses in the u.s. for rituxan; and
(iii)   revenues on sales in the rest of world for rituxan, which consist of our share of pre-tax co-promotion profits on rituxan in canada and royalty revenue on rituxan sales outside the u.s. and canada by the roche group and its sublicensees.
pre-tax co-promotion profits on rituxan and gazyva are calculated and paid to us by genentech in the u.s. pre-tax co-promotion profits on rituxan are calculated and paid to us by the roche group in canada. pre-tax co-promotion profits consist of u.s. and canadian net sales to third-party customers less applicable costs to manufacture, third-party royalty expenses, distribution, selling and marketing expenses, and joint development expenses incurred by genentech, the roche group and us. we record our share of the pre-tax co-promotion profits on rituxan in canada and royalty revenues on rituxan sales outside the u.s. on a cash basis as we do not have the ability to estimate these profits or royalty revenue in the period incurred. our share of the pre-tax profits on rituxan and gazyva in the u.s. includes estimates made by genentech and those estimates are subject to change. actual results may differ from our estimates.
concentrations of credit risk the majority of our accounts receivable arise from product sales in the u.s. and europe and are primarily due from wholesale distributors, public hospitals and other government entities. we monitor the financial performance and creditworthiness of our customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile. we continue to monitor these conditions, including the volatility associated with international economies and the relevant financial markets, and assess their possible impact on our business. credit and economic conditions in the e.u. continue to remain uncertain, which has, from time to time, led to longer collection periods for our accounts receivable and greater collection risk in certain countries.
where our collections continue to be subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices and a portion of these receivables are routinely being collected beyond our contractual payment terms and over periods in excess of one year, we have discounted our receivables and reduced related revenues based on the period of time that we estimate those amounts will be paid, to the extent such period exceeds one year, using the country's market-based borrowing rate for such period. the related receivables are classified at the time of sale as non-current assets.
to date, we have not experienced any significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable. if economic conditions worsen and/or the financial condition of our customers were to further deteriorate, our risk of collectability may increase, which may result in additional allowances and/or significant bad debts.
74
for additional information related to our concentration of credit risk associated with our accounts receivable balances, please read the subsection entitled "credit risk" in the "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" section of this report.
collaborative and other relationships our development and commercialization arrangements with sobi and abbvie represent collaborative arrangements as each party is an active participant and exposed to significant risks and rewards of the arrangements. where we are the principal on sales transactions with third parties, we recognize revenue, cost of sales and sales and marketing expenses on a gross basis in their respective lines in our consolidated statements of income. where we are not the principal on sales transactions with third parties, we record our share of the revenues, cost of sales and sales and marketing expenses on a net basis in collaborative and other relationships in our consolidated statements of income.
for additional information related to our collaborations with sobi and abbvie, please read note 19, collaborative and other relationships to these consolidated financial statements.
capitalization of inventory costs we capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval, when, based on management's judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. we consider numerous attributes in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a particular product should be capitalized as an asset. we assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process, including any known safety or efficacy concerns, potential labeling restrictions and other impediments to approval. we evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used. we consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could hamper approval or commercialization. we consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or delay commercialization. we also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization, trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria. finally, we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize. we expense previously capitalized costs related to pre-approval inventory upon a change in such judgment, due to, among other potential factors, a denial or significant delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies. all changes in judgment in relation to pre-approval inventory have historically been insignificant.
acquired intangible assets, including in-process research and development (ipr&d)
effective january 1, 2009, when we purchase a business, the acquired ipr&d is measured at fair value, capitalized as an intangible asset and tested for impairment at least annually, as of october 31, until commercialization, after which time the ipr&d is amortized over its estimated useful life. if we acquire an asset or group of assets that do not meet the definition of a business under applicable accounting standards, the acquired ipr&d is expensed on its acquisition date. future costs to develop these assets are recorded to research and development expense as they are incurred.
we have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, intangible assets through the acquisition of biotechnology companies or through the consolidation of variable interest entities. these intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and ipr&d product candidates. when significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired, we generally engage an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. management will determine the fair value of less significant identifiable intangible assets acquired. discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:
•   estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in-process projects;
•   projecting regulatory approvals;
•   estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects; and
•   developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project.
we believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates.
75
if these projects are not successfully developed, the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods. additionally, the value of the acquired intangible assets may become impaired. we believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the ipr&d analysis were reasonable at the time of the respective acquisition. no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with such projects, will transpire as estimated.
certain ipr&d programs have a fair value that is not significantly in excess of carrying value, including our program for the treatment of tgn. such programs could become impaired if assumptions used in determining the fair value change.
impairment and amortization of long-lived assets and accounting for goodwill long-lived assets other than goodwill long-lived assets to be held and used include property, plant and equipment as well as intangible assets, including ipr&d and trademarks. property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. we review our intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, as of october 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
when performing our impairment assessment, we calculate the fair value using the same methodology as described above under "acquired intangible assets, including in-process research and development (ipr&d)". if the carrying value of our intangible assets with indefinite lives exceeds its fair value, then the intangible asset is written-down to its fair value.
our most significant intangible assets are our acquired and in-licensed rights and patents and developed technology. acquired and in-licensed rights and patents primarily relates to our acquisition of all remaining rights to tysabri from elan. developed technology primarily relates to our avonex product, which was recorded in connection with the merger of biogen, inc. and idec pharmaceuticals corporation in 2003. we amortize the intangible assets related to tysabri and avonex using the economic consumption method based on revenue generated from the products underlying the related intangible assets. an analysis of the anticipated lifetime revenues of tysabri and avonex is performed annually during our long range planning cycle, which is generally updated in the third quarter of each year, and whenever events or changes in circumstances would significantly affect the anticipated lifetime revenues of tysabri or avonex.
for additional information on the impairment charges related to our long-lived assets during 2016 and 2014, please read note 6, intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. impairment charges related to our long-lived assets during 2015 were insignificant.
goodwill goodwill relates largely to amounts that arose in connection with the merger of biogen, inc. and idec pharmaceuticals corporation in 2003 and amounts that are being paid in connection with the acquisition of fumapharm ag. our goodwill balances represent the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
we assess our goodwill balance within our single reporting unit annually, as of october 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and, if so, the extent of such impairment. we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of our reporting unit, then we would need to determine the implied fair value of our reporting unit's goodwill. if the carrying value of our reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.
we completed our required annual impairment test in the fourth quarters of 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and determined in each of those periods that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired. in each year, the fair value of our reporting unit, which includes goodwill, was significantly in excess of the carrying value of our reporting unit.
76
investments, including fair value measures and impairments we invest in various types of securities, including short-term and long-term marketable securities, principally corporate notes, government securities including government sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities and credit card and auto loan asset-backed securities, in which our excess cash balances are invested.
in accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements, we have classified our financial assets as level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets that we have the ability to access. fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices, interest rates, yield curves and foreign currency spot rates. fair values determined by level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset.
as noted in note 7, fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements, a majority of our financial assets have been classified as level 2. these assets have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing third-party pricing services. the pricing services use many observable market inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. we validate the prices provided by our third-party pricing services by understanding the models used, obtaining market values from other pricing sources and analyzing pricing data in certain instances.
impairment we conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments. an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income.
for available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, management performs an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. where we intend to sell a security, or may be required to do so, the security's decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss is reflected within earnings as an impairment loss.
regardless of our intent to sell a security, we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security. credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security and are reflected within earnings as an impairment loss.
share-based compensation we make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our share-based compensation arrangements. changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the amount of expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.
determining the appropriate valuation model and related assumptions requires judgment, and includes estimating the expected market price of our stock on vesting date and stock price volatility as well as the term of the expected awards. determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of performance targets requires judgment, including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets. the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made throughout the term as appropriate. the cumulative impact of any revision is reflected in the period of change.
we also estimate forfeitures over the requisite service period when recognizing share-based compensation expense based on historical rates and forward-looking factors. these estimates are adjusted to the extent that actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to materially differ, from our estimates.

contingent consideration for acquisitions completed before january 1, 2009, we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination when the contingency is resolved. for acquisitions completed after january 1, 2009, we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to contingent consideration expense in our consolidated statements of income. changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes to one or multiple inputs including adjustments to the discount rates and achievement and timing of any cumulative sales-based and development milestones, or changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval. these fair value measurements represent level 3 measurements as they are based on significant inputs not observable in the market.
significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. accordingly, changes in assumptions described above, could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.
restructuring charges we have made estimates and judgments regarding the amount and timing of our restructuring expense and liability, including current and future period termination benefits, pipeline program termination costs and other exit costs to be incurred when related actions take place. severance and other related costs are reflected in our consolidated statements of income as a component of total restructuring charges incurred. actual results may differ from these estimates.
income taxes we prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction's tax laws and regulations. in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. in performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. in making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and the effects of tax planning strategies. our estimates of future taxable income include, among other items, our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options. in the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
all tax effects associated with intercompany transfers of assets within our consolidated group, both current and deferred, are recorded as a prepaid tax or deferred charge and recognized through our consolidated statements of income when the asset transferred is sold to a third-party or otherwise recovered through amortization of the asset's remaining economic life. if the asset transferred becomes impaired, for example through the obsolescence of inventory or the discontinuation of a research program, we will expense any remaining deferred charge or prepaid tax. as of december 31, 2016, total deferred charges and prepaid taxes were $989.8 million. for additional information related to the new accounting standard on tax effects associated with intercompany transfers of assets within our consolidated group please read note 1, summary of significant accounting policies: new accounting pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

we account for uncertain tax positions using a "more-likely-than-not" threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors that include, but are not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished, through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the "more-likely-than-not" threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process. we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews, we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position, and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re-examine the related tax position. we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s. as a result, a portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held by foreign subsidiaries. we currently do not intend or foresee a need to repatriate these funds. we expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future.
as of december 31, 2016, our non-u.s. subsidiaries' undistributed foreign earnings included in consolidated retained earnings and other basis differences aggregated to approximately $7.6 billion. all undistributed foreign earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries, exclusive of earnings that would result in little or no net income tax expense or which were previously taxed under current u.s. tax law, are reinvested indefinitely in operations outside the u.s. this determination is made on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and takes into the account the liquidity requirements in both the u.s. and within our foreign subsidiaries.
if we decide to repatriate funds in the future to execute our growth initiatives or to fund any other liquidity needs, the resulting tax consequences would negatively impact our results of operations through a higher effective tax rate and dilution of our earnings. the residual u.s. tax liability, if cumulative amounts were repatriated, would be between $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion as of december 31, 2016.

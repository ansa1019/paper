item 1a.   risk factors

for an enterprise as large and complex as we are, a wide range of factors could materially affect future results and performance. the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. in addition, these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
financial risks and risks of operation our revenues and the value of our properties are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry.
the performance of the lodging industry traditionally has been affected by the strength of the general economy and, specifically, growth in gross domestic product ("gdp"). because lodging industry demand typically follows the general economy, the lodging industry is cyclical and this cyclicality contributes to potentially large fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations. changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers, particularly during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth, may create difficulties for the industry over the long-term and adversely affect our results of operations.
in addition, the majority of our hotels are classified as luxury or upper upscale and generally target business and high-end leisure travelers. in periods of economic difficulties, business and leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel costs by limiting travel or seeking to reduce costs of their trips. consequently, our luxury or upper upscale hotels may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenue during an economic downturn, as compared to hotels in other categories that have lower room rates.  for instance, reductions in overall travel during the recession in 2008 and 2009 significantly affected our results of operations.
other circumstances affecting the lodging industry which may affect our performance and the forecasts we make include:
•   the effect on lodging demand of changes in national and local economic and business conditions, including concerns about the duration and strength of u.s. economic growth, global economic prospects, consumer confidence and the value of the u.s. dollar;

•   factors that may shape public perception of travel to a particular location, such as natural disasters, weather events, pandemics and outbreaks of contagious diseases such as the zika virus, and the occurrence or potential occurrence of terrorist attacks, all of which will affect occupancy rates at our hotels and the demand for hotel products and services;

17
•   risks that the recent travel ban to the united states and proposed immigration policies will suppress international travel to the united states generally;

•   the impact of geopolitical developments outside the u.s., such as the pace of the economic recovery in europe, the effects of the united kingdom's referendum to withdraw from the european union, the slowing of growth in emerging markets such as china and brazil, or unrest in the middle east, which could affect the relative volatility of global credit markets generally, global travel and lodging demand, including with respect to our foreign hotel properties;

•   volatility in global financial and credit markets, and the impact of budget deficits and pending and future u.s. governmental action to address such deficits through reductions in spending and similar austerity measures, which could materially adversely affect u.s. and global economic conditions, business activity, credit availability, borrowing costs, and lodging demand;

•   operating risks associated with the hotel business, including the effect of increasing operating or labor costs or changes in workplace rules that affect labor costs;

•   the ability of our hotels to compete effectively against other lodging businesses in the highly competitive markets in which we operate in areas such as access, location, quality of accommodations and room rate structures;

•   changes in the desirability of the geographic regions of the hotels in our portfolio or in the travel patterns of hotel customers;

•   changes in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages, hotel employee health care costs, prices, interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs;

•   the ability of third-party internet and other travel intermediaries to attract and retain customers; and

•   decreases in the frequency of business travel that may result from alternatives to in-person meetings, including virtual meetings hosted online or over private teleconferencing networks.

we cannot assure you that adverse changes in the general economy or other circumstances that affect the lodging industry will not have an adverse effect on the hotel revenue or earnings at our properties. a reduction in our revenue or earnings as a result of the above risks may reduce our working capital and revenue, impact our long-term business strategy and impact the value of our assets and our ability to meet certain covenants in our existing debt agreements. in addition, we may incur impairment charges in the future, which charges will affect negatively our results of operations. we can provide no assurance that any impairment loss recognized will not be material to our results of operations.
in addition to general economic conditions affecting the lodging industry, new hotel room supply is an important factor that can affect the lodging industry's performance and overbuilding has the potential to further exacerbate the negative impact of an economic downturn.  room rates and occupancy, and thus revpar, tend to increase when demand growth exceeds supply growth.  a reduction or slowdown in the growth of lodging demand or increased growth in lodging supply could result in returns that are substantially below expectations or result in losses which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth.
we depend on external sources of capital for future growth; therefore, any disruption to our ability to access capital at times, and on terms reasonably acceptable to us, may affect adversely our business and results of operations.
since we have elected reit status, host inc. must finance its growth and fund debt repayments largely with external sources of capital because it is required to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its taxable income (other than net capital gain) in order to qualify as a reit, including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which it does not receive cash. funds used by host inc. to make required distributions are provided by distributions from host l.p. our ability to access external capital could be hampered by a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:
•   price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the u.s. and global equity and credit markets;

•   changes in market perception of our growth potential, including rating agency downgrades by moody's investors service, standard &amp; poor's ratings services or fitch ratings;

•   decreases in our current or estimated future earnings;

•   decreases or fluctuations in the market price of the common stock of host inc.;

•   increases in interest rates; and

•   the terms of our existing indebtedness which, under certain circumstances, restrict our incurrence of debt.

18
the occurrence of any of these factors, individually or in combination, could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our future growth and on our results of operations and financial condition.  potential consequences of disruptions in u.s. and global equity and credit markets and, as a result, an inability for us to access external capital at times, and on terms, reasonably acceptable to us could include:
•   a need to seek alternative sources of capital with less attractive terms, such as more restrictive covenants and shorter maturity;

•   adverse effects on our financial condition and liquidity, and our ability to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures;

•   higher costs of capital;

•   an inability to enter into derivative contracts in order to hedge risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or

•   an inability to execute on our acquisition strategy.

we operate in a highly competitive industry.
the lodging industry is highly competitive. our principal competitors are other owners and investors in upper upscale and luxury full-service hotels, including other lodging reits. our hotels face strong competition for individual guests, group reservations and conference business from major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands as well as from other smaller hotel chains, independent and local hotel owners and operators. we compete for customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, as well as location, room rates, property size and availability of rooms and conference space, quality of the accommodations, customer satisfaction, amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points. new hotels may be constructed and these additions to supply create new competitors, in some cases without corresponding increases in demand for hotel rooms. our competitors may have similar or greater commercial and financial resources which allow them to improve their properties in ways that affect our ability to compete for guests effectively and adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth.
we also compete for hotel acquisitions with entities that have similar investment objectives as we do. this competition could limit the number of investment opportunities that we find suitable for our business.  it may also increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell to us, making it more difficult for us to acquire new properties on attractive terms or on the terms contemplated in our business plan.
there are inherent risks with investments in real estate, including the relative illiquidity of real estate investments.
investments in real estate are inherently illiquid and cannot generally be quickly sold.  for this reason, we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any hotel that we desire to sell for the price or on terms acceptable to us, or the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close on the sale of a hotel. therefore, we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions and dispose of assets at opportune times or on favorable terms, which may adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to make distributions to stockholders.
in addition, real estate ownership is subject to various risks, including:
•   government regulations relating to real estate ownership or operations, including tax, environmental, zoning and eminent domain laws;

•   loss in value of real estate due to changes in market conditions or the area in which real estate is located;

•   potential civil liability for accidents or other occurrences on owned or leased properties;

•   the ongoing need for owner-funded capital improvements and expenditures to maintain or upgrade properties;

•   periodic total or partial closures due to renovations and facility improvements;

•   changes in tax laws and property taxes, or an increase in the assessed valuation of a property for real estate tax purposes; and

•   force majeure events, such as earthquakes, floods or other possibly uninsured losses.

19
we have substantial debt and may incur additional debt.
as of december 31, 2016, we and our subsidiaries had total indebtedness of approximately $3.6 billion. our indebtedness requires us to commit a significant portion of our annual cash flow from operations to debt service payments, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, dividends and distributions and other general corporate needs. additionally, our substantial indebtedness could:
•   make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;

•   limit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our debt or to obtain financing for expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate needs on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all; or

•   affect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions.

if our cash flow and working capital are not sufficient to fund our expenditures or service our indebtedness, we will be required to raise additional funds through:
•   sales of host l.p.'s op units or host inc.'s common stock;

•   the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness by host l.p.; or

•   sales of our assets.

we cannot make any assurances that any of these sources of funds will be available to us or, if available, will be on terms that we would find acceptable or in amounts sufficient to meet our obligations or fulfill our business plan. under certain circumstances, we would be required to use the cash generated by any or all of the events described above to repay other indebtedness.
the terms of our indebtedness and preferred units place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and these restrictions reduce our operational flexibility and create default risks.
we are, and may in the future become, party to agreements and instruments that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries.  for instance, the covenants in the documents governing the terms of our senior notes and our credit facility restrict, among other things, our ability to:
•   execute acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, unless the successor entity in such transaction assumes our indebtedness;

•   incur additional debt in excess of certain thresholds and without satisfying certain financial metrics;

•   incur liens securing indebtedness, unless an effective provision is made to secure our other indebtedness by such liens;

•   sell assets without using the proceeds from such sales for certain permitted uses or to make an offer to repay or repurchase outstanding indebtedness;

•   pay dividends on classes and series of host inc. capital stock and pay distributions on host l.p.'s classes of units without satisfying certain financial metrics concerning leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage; and

•   conduct transactions with affiliates other than on an arm's length basis and, in certain instances, without obtaining opinions as to the fairness of such transactions.

in addition, certain covenants in our credit facility also require us and our subsidiaries to meet financial metrics. the restrictive covenants in the applicable indenture(s), the credit facility and the documents governing our other debt (including our mortgage debt) will reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations and will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt. for a detailed description of the covenants and restrictions imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness, see part ii item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-financial condition."
an increase in interest rates would increase the interest costs on our credit facility and on our floating rate debt and could impact adversely our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets.
interest payments for borrowings on our credit facility and the mortgages on certain properties are based on floating rates. as a result, an increase in interest rates will reduce our cash flow available for other corporate purposes, including investments in our portfolio. as of december 31, 2016, approximately 35% of our debt is subject to floating interest rates.
rising interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures and increase interest costs on any debt that is refinanced. we may from time to time enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate
20
hedging contracts. currently, the majority of our mortgages with floating rates, including mortgages on our joint venture properties, are fully or partially hedged through the use of floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps or interest rate caps. these agreements expose us to the risk that other parties to the agreements will not perform or that the agreements will be unenforceable. in addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to dispose of assets as part of our business strategy.
our expenses may not decrease if our revenue decreases.
many of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels, such as debt-service payments, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and employee wages and benefits, are relatively inflexible. they do not necessarily decrease directly with a reduction in revenue at the hotels and may be subject to increases that are not tied to the performance of our hotels or the increase in the rate of inflation generally. also, as of december 31, 2016, 26 of our hotels are subject to third-party ground leases, which generally require periodic increases in ground rent payments. our ability to pay these rents could be affected adversely if our hotel revenues do not increase at the same or a greater rate than the increases in rental payments under the ground leases.
additionally, certain costs, such as wages, benefits and insurance, may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period. in the event of a significant decrease in demand, our hotel managers may not be able to reduce the size of hotel work forces in order to decrease wages and benefits. our managers also may be unable to offset any fixed or increased expenses with higher room rates. any of our efforts to reduce operating costs also could adversely affect the future growth of our business and the value of our hotel properties.
our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations.
we may acquire properties through various structures, including transactions involving portfolios, single assets, joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits or similar real estate ownership entities. we anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed with a combination of methods and a variety of sources of external capital, including proceeds from host inc. equity offerings, issuance of limited partnership interests of host l.p., advances under our credit facility, the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness and proceeds from the sale of assets. our inability to access external sources of capital may limit our ability to finance acquisitions. for a discussion of factors that may limit our access to sources of capital, see "-we depend on external sources of capital for future growth; therefore, any disruption to our ability to access capital at times, and on terms reasonably acceptable to us, may affect adversely our business and results of operations."  in addition, certain of these factors, such as disruption in the global capital markets, may limit the ability of purchasers to finance their acquisition of our hotels and therefore our ability to use disposition proceeds to finance our acquisitions.
we routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions. we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions. our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations. these adverse effects may occur because the performance of the property does not support the additional indebtedness and related interest expense that we incurred as a result of the acquisition. in addition, assets and entities that we have acquired, or may in the future acquire, may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse, or only limited recourse, against the sellers.  in general, the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements may not survive long enough for us to become aware of such liabilities and to seek recourse against our sellers and indemnification covering representations and warranties often is limited and subject to various materiality thresholds, a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses. as a result, there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties. the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with acquired hotels and entities may exceed our expectations, plus we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects, all of which may affect adversely our revenues, expenses, operating results and financial condition. finally, indemnification agreements between us and the sellers typically provide that the sellers will retain certain specified liabilities relating to the assets and entities acquired by us. while the sellers generally are contractually obligated to pay all losses and other expenses relating to such retained liabilities without regard to survival limitations, materiality thresholds, deductibles or caps on losses, there can be no guarantee that such arrangements will not require us to incur losses or other expenses in addition to those incurred by the sellers.
21
we may not achieve the value we anticipate from new hotel developments or value enhancement projects at our existing hotels.
we currently are, and in the future may be, involved in the construction or development of hotel properties, timeshare units or other alternate uses of portions of our existing properties, including the development of retail, office or apartments, including through joint ventures. there are risks inherent in any new development, including:
•   we may not obtain the zoning, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations necessary to complete the development. a delay in receiving these approvals could affect adversely the returns we expect to receive.

•   any new construction involves the possibility of construction delays and cost overruns that may increase project costs.

•   defects in design or construction may result in delays and additional costs to remedy the defect or require a portion of a property to be closed during the period required to rectify the defect.

•   we may not be able to meet the loan covenants in any financing obtained to fund the new development, creating default risks.

•   natural or manmade disasters may delay construction or increase construction costs.

•   risks related to change in economic and market conditions between development commencement and stabilization.

•   the development of timeshare units could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for residential, fractional or interval ownership, increases in mortgage rates and/or decreases in mortgage availability, market absorption or oversupply, with the result that we may not be able to sell the timeshares for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we initially anticipated.

in addition, to the extent that developments are conducted through joint ventures, this creates additional risks, including the possibility that our partners may not meet their financial obligations or develop business interests, policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours. see "-we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts."
any of the above factors could affect adversely our and our partners' ability to complete the developments on schedule and along the scope that currently is contemplated, or to achieve the intended value of these projects. for these reasons, there can be no assurances as to the value to be realized by us from these transactions or any future similar transactions.
we do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels.
to maintain our status as a reit, we are not permitted to operate any of our hotels. as a result, we have entered into management agreements with third-party managers to operate our hotel properties. for this reason, we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the daily operation and marketing of our hotels, such as decisions with respect to the setting of room rates, food and beverage pricing and certain similar matters. although we consult with our hotel operators with respect to strategic business plans, the hotel operators are under no obligation to implement any of our recommendations with respect to these matters. while we monitor the hotel managers' performance, we have limited recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately. the cash flow from our hotels may be affected adversely if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain a quality brand name.  because our management agreements are long-term in nature, we also may not be able to terminate these agreements if we believe the manager is not performing adequately.
from time to time, we have had, and continue to have, differences with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements. we generally resolve issues with our managers through discussions and negotiations. however, if we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations, we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to third-party dispute resolution. failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements or the failure of our managers to adequately manage the risks associated with hotel operations could affect adversely our results of operations.
in addition, our hotel managers or their affiliates manage, and in some cases own, have invested in, or provided credit support or operating guarantees, to hotels that compete with our hotels, all of which may result in conflicts of interest. as a result, our hotel managers have in the past made, and may in the future make, decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interest.
furthermore, our management agreements for our brand managed properties generally have provisions that can restrict our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer our hotels, unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets specified other conditions. our ability to finance or sell our properties,
22
depending upon the structure of such transactions, may require the manager's consent. similarly, decisions with respect to the repositioning of a hotel, such as the outsourcing of food and beverage outlets, may require the manager's consent.
the properties managed by marriott international account for most of our revenues and operating income. adverse developments in marriott's business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us.
on september 23, 2016, marriott international completed its acquisition of starwood hotels and resorts worldwide, bringing starwood's brands under marriott's management. as a result of the merger, approximately 78% of our properties (as measured by revenues) now are managed or franchised by marriott. we rely on marriott's personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage and maintain our hotel operations efficiently, effectively, profitably and in compliance with the terms, responsibilities and duties of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. any adverse developments in marriott's business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties and could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, the integration of starwood's brands under marriott management may expose us to additional risks and costs at our properties, and will place a significant burden on marriott's management and internal resources and the potential for diversion of its attention from the day-to-day business operations of its hotels, including hotels owned by us.
we are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor.
our third-party managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels. although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our consolidated hotels (other than employing, but not managing or supervising, the employees at our properties in brazil and australia), we still remain subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, particularly at those hotels with unionized labor. from time to time, hotel operations may be disrupted as a result of strikes, lockouts, public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity. we also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes involving our third-party managers and their labor force or other events. the resolution of labor disputes or re-negotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs, a significant component of our hotel operating costs, either by increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs. as we are not the employer nor bound by any collective bargaining agreement, we do not negotiate with any labor organization, and it is the responsibility of each property's manager to enter into such labor contracts. our ability, if any, to have any meaningful impact on the outcome of these negotiations is restricted by and dependent on the individual management agreement covering a specific property and we may have little ability to control the outcome of these negotiations.
our hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive in the marketplace, maintain brand standards or to comply with applicable laws or regulations. the timing and costs of such renovations or improvements may result in reduced operating performance during construction and may not improve the return on these investments.
we are required by our loan agreements or agreements with our hotel managers to make agreed upon capital expenditures. in addition, we will need to make further capital expenditures in order to remain competitive with other hotels, to maintain the economic value of our hotels and to comply with applicable laws and regulations. the timing of these improvements can affect hotel performance, particularly if the improvements require closure of a significant number of rooms or other features of the hotels, such as ballrooms, meeting space and restaurants. these capital improvements reduce the availability of cash for other purposes and are subject to cost overruns and delays. in addition, because we depend on external sources of capital, we may not have the necessary funds to invest and, if we fail to maintain our properties in accordance with brand standards set by our managers, they may terminate the management agreement. moreover, we may not necessarily realize a significant, or any, improvement in the performance of the hotels in which we make these investments.
our hotels are geographically concentrated in a limited number of large urban cities and, accordingly, we could be disproportionately harmed by adverse changes to these markets, a natural disaster or threat of a terrorist attack.
the concentration of our hotels in a limited number of large urban cities exposes us to greater risk to local economic or business conditions, changes in hotel supply in these cities, and other conditions than more geographically diversified hotel companies. hotels in new york, washington, d.c., san diego, san francisco, boston, florida, hawaii, atlanta, and los angeles represented approximately 72% of our 2016 revenues. an economic downturn, an increase in hotel supply in these cities, a natural disaster, a terrorist attack or similar disaster in any one of these cities likely would cause a decline in the hotel market and adversely affect occupancy rates, the financial performance of our hotels in these cities and our overall results of operations. for example, in october 2012, our operations in new york city and other east coast properties were impacted negatively by hurricane sandy.  in 2013, decreased u.s. government demand for hotel rooms (approximately 5% of our business) in markets such as washington, d.c. had a negative impact on our results of operations.
23
the threat of terrorism also may negatively impact hotel occupancy and average daily rate, due to resulting disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns and concerns about travel safety. hotels in major metropolitan areas, such as the major cities that represent our target markets, may be particularly adversely affected due to concerns about travel safety. the possibility of future attacks may hamper business and leisure travel patterns and, accordingly, the performance of our business and our operations.
the ownership of hotels outside the united states will expose us to risks related to owning hotels in those international markets.
as of december 31, 2016, we own directly 7 hotels located outside of the united states. we also are party to a joint venture that owns 10 hotels in europe and to a joint venture that owns a non-controlling interest in five hotels currently open and two hotels under development in india. we may have difficulty managing our expansion into new geographic markets where we have limited knowledge and understanding of the local economy, an absence of business relationships in the area, or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures and regulations. there are risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states, which include:
•   risks of non-compliance with varied and unfamiliar employment laws and practices;

•   tax laws, which may provide for income or other taxes or tax rates that exceed those of the u.s. and which may provide that foreign earnings that are repatriated, directly or indirectly, are subject to dividend withholding tax requirements or other restrictions and which may affect our ability to repatriate non-u.s. earnings in a tax efficient manner;

•   compliance with and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy;

•   the willingness of domestic or international lenders to provide financing and changes in the availability, cost and terms of such financing;

•   rapid adverse changes in local, political, economic and market conditions;

•   the ability to obtain insurance coverage related to terrorist events;

•   changes of interest rates and/or currency exchange rates and hyperinflation or deflation and difficulties in hedging these risks;

•   regulations regarding the incurrence of debt;

•   difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries; and

•   difficulties in complying with u.s. rules governing reits while operating outside of the united states.

any of these factors could affect adversely our ability to obtain all of the intended benefits of our international expansion. if we do not effectively manage this expansion and successfully integrate the international hotels into our organization, our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.
we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts.
we have made investments in joint ventures and are exploring further investment opportunities in the united states and internationally. we may, from time to time, invest as a co-venturer in other entities holding hotel properties instead of purchasing hotel properties directly. we also may sell interests in existing properties to a third party as part of forming a joint venture with the third party. investments in joint ventures may involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. co-venturers often share control over the operation of a joint venture. actions by a co-venturer also could subject the assets to additional risks as a result of any of the following circumstances:
•   our co-venturer might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our, or the joint venture's, interests or goals; or

•   our co-venturer may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests, or contrary to our policies or objectives.

for certain joint ventures, we might not be able to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners. disputes between us and our partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and may negatively impact operations.
although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow, in some cases they may be unable to distribute that cash to the joint venture partners due to tax laws or other restrictions on our ability to repatriate non u.s. earnings in a tax efficient manner.  additionally, in some cases our joint venture partners share control over distributions and may choose to retain capital in the joint
24
venture rather than to distribute it. because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us, our failure to receive distributions from our joint ventures could reduce our cash flow return on these investments.
the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business.
a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual or "transient" customers are booked through internet travel intermediaries. search engines and peer-to-peer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our hotels. if bookings shift to higher cost distribution channels, including these internet travel intermediaries, it could materially impact our revenues and profitability. additionally, as intermediary bookings increase, these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions, reduced room rates or other significant contract concessions from the brands and hotel management companies operating our hotels. also, although internet travel intermediaries traditionally have competed to attract transient business rather than group and convention business, in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to large group and convention business. if that growth continues, it could both divert group and convention business away from our hotels and also increase our cost of sales for group and convention business. consolidation of internet travel intermediaries, and the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business, also could divert bookings away from the websites of our hotel managers and increase our cost of sales.
full insurance recovery for terrorist acts may not be possible.
we generally obtain terrorism insurance to cover property damage caused by acts of terrorism under separate standalone policies of insurance as well as policies on u.s. properties which currently are subject to u.s. federal government cost sharing as provided in the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act ("tripra"), which has been extended through december 31, 2020. we also have terrorism insurance under our general liability program and in our program for directors' and officers' coverage. we also obtain terrorism insurance to cover some of our foreign properties through insurance programs involving or administered by foreign governments. we may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance policies for losses caused by some types of terrorist acts, and neither u.s. nor foreign terrorism insurance legislation or regulations ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future.
while tripra allows direct insurers to be reimbursed for certain losses they incur on u.s. properties resulting from nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological ("nbcr") perils, tripra does not require insurers to offer coverage for these perils and, to date, insurers are not willing to provide this coverage, even with government reimbursement. any damage related to war and to nbcr incidents, therefore, is excluded under policies covering our u.s. properties. moreover, many of our foreign properties are not covered against nbcr perils. we obtain a certain amount of property insurance coverage on our u.s. properties for nbcr perils through our wholly-owned subsidiary that acts as our direct insurer against such perils to the extent of reimbursement under tripra. we ultimately are responsible for any loss borne by our insurance subsidiary.
as a result of the above, there remains uncertainty regarding the adequacy and cost of terrorism coverage that will be available to protect our interests in the event of terrorist attacks that impact our properties.
some potential losses are not covered by insurance.
we, or our hotel managers, carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability, property, business interruption and other risks with respect to all of our hotels and other properties. these policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar types of properties. generally, our "all-risk" property policies provide coverage that is available on a per-occurrence basis and that, for each occurrence, has an overall limit, as well as various sub-limits, on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive. sub-limits exist for certain types of claims, such as service interruption, debris removal, expediting costs, landscaping replacement and natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes, and may be subject to annual aggregate coverage limits. the dollar amounts of these sub-limits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit. in this regard, hotels in certain of our markets, including california, florida and seattle, have in the past been and continue to be particularly susceptible to damage from natural disasters. recovery under the applicable policies also is subject to substantial deductibles and complex calculations of lost business income. there is no assurance that this insurance, where maintained, will fully fund the re-building or restoration of a hotel that is impacted by an earthquake, hurricane, or other natural disaster, or the income lost as a result of the damage. our property policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined together for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sub-limits contained in our policies have been exceeded and, in the case where the manager of one of our hotels provides this coverage, any such claims will be combined with the claims of other owners participating in the manager's program for the same purpose. therefore, if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels, or, in the case of hotels where coverage is provided by the manager, affects hotels owned by others, the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or
25
sub-limits, depending on the type of claim, have been reached. each affected hotel only may receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy if the total value of the loss exceeds the aggregate limits available. we may incur losses in excess of insured limits and, as a result, we may be even less likely to receive complete coverage for risks that affect multiple properties, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, or certain types of terrorism.
in addition, there are other risks, such as certain environmental hazards, that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify coverage. we also may encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy. should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur, or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier, we could lose all or a part of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel. in that event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property.
cyber threats and the risk of data breaches or disruptions of our managers' or our own information technology systems could materially adversely affect our business.
our third party hotel managers are dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to access, process, transmit and store proprietary and customer information. these complex networks include reservation systems, vacation exchange systems, hotel management systems, customer databases, call centers, administrative systems, and third party vendor systems. these systems require the collection and retention of large volumes of personally identifiable information of hotel guests, including credit card numbers. our hotel managers may store and process such proprietary and customer information both on systems located at the hotels we own and other hotels operated by our third party managers, their corporate locations and at third-party owned facilities, including, for example, in a third-party hosted cloud environment. these information networks and systems can be vulnerable to threats such as system, network or internet failures; computer hacking or business disruption; cyber-terrorism; viruses, worms or other malicious software programs; and employee error, negligence or fraud. these threats can be introduced in any number of ways, including through third parties accessing our hotel managers' information networks and systems. the risks from these cyber threats are significant. we rely on the security systems of our managers to protect proprietary and customer information from these threats. any compromise of our managers' networks could result in a disruption to operations, such as disruptions in fulfilling guest reservations, delayed bookings or sales, or lost guest reservations. any of these events could, in turn, result in disruption of the operations of the hotels we own that are managed by them, in increased costs and in potential litigation and liability. all of our major hotel management companies and a majority of our third party operators maintain insurance against cyber threats. however, these policies provide varying limits and may be subject to sub limits for certain types of claims, and it is not expected that these policies will provide a total recovery of all potential losses. in addition, public disclosure, or loss of customer or proprietary information, could result in damage to the manager's reputation and a loss of confidence among hotel guests and result in reputational harm for the hotels owned by us and managed by them, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition to the information technologies and systems of our managers used to operate our hotels, we have our own corporate technologies and systems that are used to access, store, transmit, and manage or support a variety of business processes. there can be no assurance that the security measures we have taken to protect the contents of these systems will prevent failures, inadequacies or interruptions in system services or that system security will not be breached through physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, and attacks by hackers. disruptions in service, system shutdowns and security breaches in the information technologies and systems we use, including unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial reporting and compliance, and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties which could be significant and we do not currently insure against these losses.
litigation judgments or settlements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition.
we are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business and are vigorously defending these claims; however, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings. we believe, based on currently available information, that the results of such proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but might be material to our operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period. we also could become the subject of future claims by the operators of our hotels, individuals or companies who use our hotels, our investors, our joint venture partners or regulating entities and these claims could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and performance.
we depend on our key personnel.
our continued success depends on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key personnel. none of our key personnel have employment agreements and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive officers. these
26
individuals are important to our business and strategy and to the extent that any of them departs and is not replaced with a qualified substitute, such person's departure could harm our operations and financial condition.
exchange rate fluctuations could affect adversely our financial results.
currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position. we generate revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the euro, the canadian dollar, the mexican peso, the australian dollar, the british pound sterling, the swedish krona, the brazilian real and the indian rupee. although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions and/or obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of these and other foreign currencies, these transactions, if entered into, will not eliminate entirely that risk. to the extent that we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with expenses paid in that same currency, exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. additionally, because our consolidated financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, if we generate revenues or earnings in other currencies, the conversion of such amounts to u.s. dollars can result in an increase or decrease in the amount of our revenues or earnings.
similarly, changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar can result in increases or decreases in demand at our u.s. properties from international travelers coming to the united states. because of the concentration of our hotels in major u.s. cities, we may have more exposure to fluctuations in international travel to the united states than other lodging companies without investments located as heavily in these markets.
applicable reit laws may restrict certain business activities.
as a reit, host inc. is subject to various restrictions on the types of income it can earn, assets it can own and activities in which it can engage. business activities that could be restricted by applicable reit laws include, but are not limited to, developing alternative uses of real estate, including the development and/or sale of timeshare or condominium units. due to these restrictions, we anticipate that we will conduct certain business activities, including those mentioned above, in one or more of our taxable reit subsidiaries. our taxable reit subsidiaries are taxable as regular c corporations and are subject to federal, state, local, and, if applicable, foreign taxation on their taxable income.
environmental problems are possible and can be costly.
our properties are subject to requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and u.s. federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. unidentified environmental liabilities could arise and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance. additionally, even after we have sold a property, we may be liable for environmental liabilities that occurred during our ownership. federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property. the owner or operator may be required to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. these laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. in addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site. environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of toxic or hazardous substances. these laws require that owners or operators of buildings properly manage and maintain these substances and notify and train those who may come into contact with them and undertake special precautions. these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to toxic or hazardous materials.
we face possible risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change.
we are subject to the risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change, which can include more frequent or severe storms, droughts, hurricanes and flooding, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations and business. to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, our coastal markets also could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea-levels causing damage to our properties. as a result, we could become subject to significant losses and/or repair costs that may or may not be fully covered by insurance. other markets may experience prolonged variations in temperature or precipitation that may limit access to the water needed to operate our hotels or significantly increase energy costs, which may subject those properties to additional regulatory burdens, such as limitations on water usage or stricter energy efficiency standards.  climate change also may affect our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable in areas most vulnerable to such events, increasing operating costs at our properties, such as the cost of water or
27
energy, and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our properties against such risks. there can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business.
compliance with other government regulations can be costly.
our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation, including title iii of the americans with disabilities act ("ada"), building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety. under the ada, all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons. these laws and regulations may be changed from time-to-time, or new regulations adopted, resulting in additional costs of compliance, including potential litigation. a determination that we are not in compliance with the ada or other laws and regulations could result in a court order to bring the hotel into compliance, imposition of civil penalties in cases brought by the justice department, or an award of attorneys' fees to private litigants. compliance with the ada and other laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures. any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
in addition, the operations of our international properties are subject to a variety of united states and international laws and regulations, including the united states foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa"). we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the fcpa and other anti-corruption laws, but we cannot assure that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations. in addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international properties might be subject and the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.
risks of ownership of host inc.'s common stock there are limitations on the acquisition of host inc. common stock and changes in control.
host inc.'s charter and by-laws, the partnership agreement of host l.p., and the maryland general corporation law (the "mgcl") contain a number of provisions, the exercise or existence of which could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for host inc.'s stockholders or host l.p.'s unitholders, including the following:
•   restrictions on transfer and ownership of host inc.'s stock. to maintain host inc.'s qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of host inc.'s outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned in the last half of the taxable year, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals, which, as defined in the code, may include certain entities. accordingly, host inc.'s charter prohibits ownership, directly or by attribution, by any person or persons acting as a group, of more than 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of shares of host inc.'s outstanding common stock, preferred stock or any other class or series of stock, each considered as a separate class or series for this purpose. together, these limitations are referred to as the "ownership limit."

stock acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and the intended acquirer of the stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any distributions thereon, to vote those shares of stock or to receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the stock in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the stock or the amount realized from the sale. a transfer of shares of host inc.'s stock to a person who, as a result of the transfer, violates the ownership limit may be void under certain circumstances, and, in any event, would deny that person any of the economic benefits of owning shares of host inc.'s stock in excess of the ownership limit. these restrictions will not apply if host inc.'s board of directors determines that it no longer is in host inc.'s best interests to continue to qualify as a reit or that compliance with the restrictions on transfer and ownership no longer is required for host inc. to qualify as a reit.
•   removal of members of the board of directors. host inc.'s charter provides that, except for any directors who may be elected by holders of a class or series of shares of capital stock other than common stock, directors may be removed only for cause and by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors. vacancies on host inc.'s board of directors may be filled, at any regular meeting or at any special meeting called for that purpose, by the affirmative vote of the remaining directors, except that a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority vote of the entire board of directors. any vacancy resulting from the removal of a director by the stockholders may be filled by the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors.

•   preferred shares; classification or reclassification of unissued shares of capital stock without stockholder approval. host inc.'s charter provides that the total number of shares of stock of all classes that host inc. has authority to issue is 1,100,000,000, consisting of 1,050,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. host inc.'s board of directors has the authority, without a vote of stockholders, to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock into other classes or series of stock, and to establish the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers,

28
restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series. because host inc.'s board of directors has this power, it may give the holders of any class or series of stock terms, preferences, powers and rights, including voting rights, senior to the rights of holders of existing stock.

•   certain provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a third-party to acquire control of host inc. certain provisions of the mgcl may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from acquiring host inc., including:

o   "business combination" provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between a corporation and an "interested stockholder" (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's then outstanding shares of voting stock or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the corporation) or an affiliate of any interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes two super-majority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and

o   "control share" provisions that provide that holders of "control shares" of a corporation (defined as voting shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned or controlled by the acquirer, would entitle the acquirer to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a "control share acquisition" (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of issued and outstanding "control shares") have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.

host inc. is subject to the maryland business combination statute. our bylaws contain a provision exempting us from the control share provisions of the mgcl. there can be no assurance that this bylaw provision exempting us from the control share provisions will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.

•   merger, consolidation, share exchange and transfer of host inc.'s assets. under maryland law and host inc.'s charter, subject to the terms of any outstanding class or series of capital stock, we can merge with or into another entity, convert, consolidate with one or more other entities, participate in a share exchange or transfer host inc.'s assets within the meaning of the mgcl if approved (1) by host inc.'s board of directors in the manner provided in the mgcl, and (2) by host inc.'s stockholders holding two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, except that any merger of host inc. with or into a trust organized for the purpose of changing host inc.'s form of organization from a corporation to a trust requires only the approval of host inc.'s stockholders holding a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the merger. under the mgcl, specified mergers may be approved without a vote of stockholders and a share exchange only is required to be approved by the board of directors of a maryland corporation if the corporation is the successor entity. host inc.'s voluntary dissolution also would require approval of stockholders holding two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.

•   certain charter amendments. host inc.'s charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transfer and ownership of host inc.'s stock, fixing the size of the board of directors within the range set forth in the charter, removal of directors, the filling of vacancies, exculpation and indemnification of directors, calling special stockholder meetings and others, all of which may be amended only by a resolution adopted by the board of directors and approved by host inc.'s stockholders holding two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. other charter amendments generally require approval of the board and the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. these provisions may make it more difficult to amend host inc.'s charter to alter the provisions described herein that could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control or the acquisition of host inc. common stock, without the approval of the board of directors.

shares of host inc.'s common stock that are or become available for sale could affect the share price of host inc.'s common stock.
we have in the past and may in the future issue additional shares of common stock to raise the capital necessary to finance hotel acquisitions, fund capital expenditures, refinance debt or for other corporate purposes. sales of a substantial number of shares of host inc.'s common stock, or the perception that sales could occur, could affect adversely prevailing market prices for host inc.'s common stock. in addition, holders of op units who redeem their units and receive, at host inc.'s election, shares of host inc. common stock will be able to sell those shares freely. as of december 31, 2016, there are approximately 8.6 million host lp op units outstanding owned by third parties that are redeemable, which represents approximately 1% of all outstanding units. further, a substantial number of shares of host inc.'s common stock have been and will be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit plans. as of december 31, 2016, we  maintain two stock-based compensation plans: (i) the comprehensive stock plan, whereby we may award to participating employees and directors restricted shares of common stock, options to purchase common stock and deferred shares of common stock, and (ii) an employee stock purchase plan. at december 31, 2016, there were approximately 14 million shares of host inc.'s common stock reserved and available for issuance under the comprehensive stock plan
29
and employee stock purchase plan and 1.3 million outstanding options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $17.78 per share.
our earnings and cash distributions will affect the market price of shares of host inc.'s common stock.
we believe that the market value of a reit's equity securities is based primarily upon the market's perception of the reit's growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions, whether from operations, sales, acquisitions, development or refinancings, and secondarily is based upon the value of the underlying assets. for that reason, shares of host inc.'s common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share. to the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves or other purposes, rather than distributing the cash flow to stockholders, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may impact negatively the market price of host inc.'s common stock. our failure to meet the market's expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions likely would affect adversely the market price of host inc.'s common stock. additionally, as a result of the 2016 u.s. elections and ongoing activity in the u.s. congress relating to tax reform proposals, there is a heightened possibility of significant changes to u.s. federal tax laws, including the possibility of lower corporate tax rates, which may make investments in reits relatively less attractive than they currently are.
federal income tax risks adverse tax consequences would occur if host inc. or its subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit.
we believe that host inc. has been organized and has operated in such a manner as to qualify as a reit under the code, commencing with its taxable year beginning january 1, 1999, and host inc. currently intends to continue to operate as a reit during future years. in addition, host inc. owns, through host l.p., one entity that has elected to be treated as a reit. as the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification and taxation as a reit are limited, no assurance can be provided that host inc. currently qualifies as a reit or will continue to qualify as a reit or that host inc.'s subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit or will continue to qualify as a reit. if our subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit, it is possible that host inc. would fail to qualify as a reit unless it (or the subsidiary reit) could avail itself of certain relief provisions. new legislation, treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could change significantly the tax laws with respect to an entity's qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of its reit qualification. if host inc. or its subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit, and any available relief provisions did not apply, the non-qualifying reit would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to its stockholders in computing its taxable income, and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. moreover, unless entitled to statutory relief, the non-qualifying reit could not qualify as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which reit qualification was lost.
to qualify as a reit, host inc. is required to satisfy several asset and gross income tests. our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which assets are not susceptible to a precise determination of fair market value, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. our compliance with the reit gross income and quarterly asset test requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our gross income and assets on an ongoing basis. accordingly, there can be no assurance that the irs will not contend that our hotel leases, interests in subsidiaries, or interests in the securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the reit gross income and asset test requirements.
any determination that host inc. or its subsidiary reit does not qualify as a reit will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could reduce materially the value of host inc.'s common stock. the additional tax liability of host inc. or the subsidiary reit for the year, or years, in which the relevant entity does not qualify as a reit would reduce its cash flow available for investment, debt service or distributions to stockholders. furthermore, the entity not qualifying as a reit no longer would be required to make distributions to its stockholders as a condition to reit qualification and any distributions made to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary c corporation dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits. this means that, if host inc. were to fail to qualify as a reit, host inc.'s stockholders currently taxed as individuals would be taxed on dividends at capital gain tax rates and host inc.'s corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject in each case to applicable limitations under the code. host inc.'s failure to qualify as a reit also would cause an event of default under host l.p.'s credit facility, which default could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due thereunder, which, in turn, would constitute an event of default under host l.p.'s outstanding debt securities.
if our hotel managers do not qualify as "eligible independent contractors," or if our hotels are not "qualified lodging facilities," host inc. will fail to qualify as a reit.
each hotel with respect to which our trs pays rent must be a "qualified lodging facility." a "qualified lodging facility" is a hotel, motel, or other establishment more than one-half of the dwelling units in which are used on a transient basis, including
30
customary amenities and facilities, provided that no wagering activities are conducted at or in connection with such facility by any person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers and who legally is authorized to engage in such business at or in connection with such facility. we believe that all of the hotels leased to our trs are qualified lodging facilities. however, the reit provisions of the code provide only limited guidance for making determinations of whether a hotel is considered a qualified lodging facility, and there can be no assurance that our hotels will be so considered in all cases.
if our hotel managers do not qualify as "eligible independent contractors", host inc. and our subsidiary reit likely will fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes. each of the hotel management companies that enters into a management contract with our trs must qualify as an "eligible independent contractor" under the reit rules in order for the rent paid to us by our trs to be qualifying gross income for the reit gross income test requirements. among other requirements, in order to qualify as an eligible independent contractor, a hotel manager cannot own more than 35% of our outstanding shares (by value) and no person or group of persons can own more than 35% of our outstanding shares and the ownership interests of the hotel manager, taking into account only owners of more than 5% of our shares and, with respect to ownership interests in such hotel managers that are publicly traded, only owners of more than 5% of such ownership interests. complex ownership attribution rules apply for purposes of these 35% ownership thresholds. although we monitor ownership of our shares by our hotel managers and their owners, and certain provisions of our charter are designed to prevent ownership of our shares in violation of these rules, there can be no assurance that these ownership limits will not be exceeded.
the size of our trs is limited and our transactions with our trs will cause us to be subject to a 100% excise tax on certain income or deductions if such transactions are not conducted on arm's-length terms.
a reit may own up to 100% of the equity interests of an entity that is a corporation for federal income tax purposes if the entity is a trs. a trs may hold assets and earn gross income that would not be considered as qualifying assets or as qualifying gross income if held or earned directly by a reit, including gross operating income from hotel operations. both the reit and its corporate subsidiary must jointly elect to treat such corporate subsidiary as a trs. a corporation of which a trs directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of its stock automatically will be treated as a trs. overall, no more than 25% (20% for tax years beginning after december 31, 2017) of the value of a reit's assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more trs. in addition, the trs rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit in order to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate income taxation.
our trs will pay federal income tax and applicable state and local income tax and, if applicable, foreign income tax on its taxable income. its after-tax net income will be available for distribution to us, but it is not required to be so distributed. we believe that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of our trs has been and will continue to be less than 25% (20% for tax years beginning after december 31, 2017) of the value of our total assets (including our trs stock and securities). furthermore, we monitor the value of our investments in our trs for the purpose of ensuring compliance with trs ownership limitations. there can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the 25% (20% for tax years beginning after december 31, 2017) value limitation discussed above.
rent paid to us by our trs may not be based on net income or profits in order for such rents to qualify as "rent from real property." we receive "percentage rent" from our trs that is calculated based on the gross revenues of the hotels subject to leases - not on net income or profits. if the irs determines that the rent paid pursuant to our leases with our trs are excessive, the deductibility thereof by the trs may be challenged, and we could be subject to a 100% excise tax on "re-determined rent" or "re-determined deductions" to the extent that such rent exceeds an arm's-length amount. recently enacted legislation has expanded the items subject to this 100% excise tax for tax years beginning on or after january 1, 2016. we believe that our rent and other transactions between our reits and their trs are based on arm's-length amounts and reflect normal business practices, but there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with our belief.
despite the reit status of each of host inc. and its subsidiary reit, we remain subject to various taxes.
notwithstanding host inc.'s status as a reit, host inc. and our subsidiaries (including our subsidiary reit) are subject to federal, state, local and foreign taxes on their net income, gross receipts, and property, in certain cases. host l.p. is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes (and any related interest and penalties) incurred by host inc.
risks relating to redemption of op units a holder who offers its op units for redemption may have adverse tax consequences.
a holder who elects to redeem their op units will be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as having sold the op units. the sale of these units is a taxable event and the holder thereof will be treated as realizing an amount equal to the sum of (1) the
31
value of the common stock or cash the holder receives, and (2) the amount of host l.p.'s nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units. the gain or loss recognized by the holder of op units is measured by the difference between the amount realized by the holder and the holder's tax basis in the op units redeemed (which tax basis includes the amount of host l.p.'s nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units). it is possible that the amount of gain and/or the tax liability related thereto that the holder recognizes and pays could exceed the value of the common stock or cash that the holder receives.
differences between an investment in shares of host inc. common stock and host l.p. op units may affect redeemed holders of op units.
if a holder elects to redeem their op units, we will determine whether the holder receives cash or shares of host inc.'s common stock in exchange for the op units. although an investment in shares of host inc.'s common stock is substantially similar to an investment in host l.p. op units, there are some differences.  these differences include form of organization, management structure, voting rights, liquidity and federal and state income taxation, some of which differences may be material to investors.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.
overview host inc. operates as a self-managed and self-administered reit that owns properties and conducts operations through host l.p., of which host inc. is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99% of its common op units as of december 31, 2016. the remainder of host l.p.'s common op units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. host inc. has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host l.p.'s day-to-day management and control.
host inc. is the largest lodging reit in nareit's composite index and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotel properties. as of february 20, 2017, we own 96 hotels in the united states and internationally and have minority ownership interests in an additional 18 hotels through joint ventures in the united states, europe and the asia/pacific region. these hotels are operated primarily under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. the majority are located in central business districts of major cities, near airports and in resort/conference destinations.
our customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business, which accounted for approximately 60%, 35%, and 5%, respectively, of our 2016 room sales. transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers. business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels. therefore, we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than trends in leisure demand. for a discussion of our customer categories, see " - our customers".
understanding our performance our revenues and expenses. our hotels are operated by third-party managers under long-term agreements, pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel. we provide operating funds, or working capital, which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages, utilities, property taxes and other hotel-level expenses. we generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each month, which distribution reflects hotel-level sales less property-level operating expenses (excluding depreciation).
operations from our domestic portfolio account for approximately 97% of our total revenues and 3% relate to our international hotels. the following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue:
% of 2016
revenues

•   rooms revenue. occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue. the business mix of the hotel (group versus transient and retail versus discount business) is a significant driver of room rates.                                                                                                   64%
•   food and beverage revenue. food &amp; beverage revenues consist of revenues from group functions, which may include banquet revenue and audio and visual revenues, as well as outlet revenues from the restaurants and lounges at our properties.                                                                                30%
•   other revenue. occupancy, the nature of the property (e.g., resort, etc.) and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue, such as attrition and cancellation, parking, golf course, spa, entertainment and other guest services. this category also includes retail and apartment rental revenue.            6%

hotel operating expenses represent approximately 98% of our total operating costs and expenses. the following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses:
% of 2016
operating costs and expenses

•   rooms expense. these costs include housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense. these costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages, as well as on the level of service and amenities that are provided.                                                       19%
•   food and beverage expense. these expenses primarily include food, beverage and the associated labor costs and will correlate closely with food and beverage revenues. group functions with banquet sales and audio and visual components generally will have lower overall costs as a percentage of revenues than outlet sales.                                          23%
•   other departmental and support expenses. these expenses include labor and other costs associated with other ancillary revenue, such as parking, golf courses, spas, entertainment and other guest services, as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments, sales and marketing, repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs.           28%
•   management fees. base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue. incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain threshold levels.                                                                                                                                                                                 5%
•   other property-level expenses. these expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes, ground rent, equipment rent and property insurance. many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels.                                                                                       8%
•   depreciation and amortization expense. this is a non-cash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of past capital expenditures.                                                                                                                                                                        15%
the expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations. it also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items. taken separately, these costs represent approximately 56% of our hotel operating expenses.
key performance indicators. revenue per available room ("revpar") is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations. revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved. revpar does not include food and beverage, parking, or other guest service revenues generated by the property. although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues, it is considered the key indicator of core revenues for many hotels.
revpar changes that are driven by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels, as well as incremental operating profit, than do changes that are driven by average room rate. for example, increases in occupancy at a hotel will lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues, such as food and beverage revenue, as well as additional incremental costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs). revpar increases due to higher room rates, however, will not result in additional room-related costs, with the exception of those charged as a percentage of revenue. as a result, changes in revpar driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than do changes in revpar caused by occupancy levels.
in discussing our operating results, we present revpar and certain other financial data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis. comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and which operations have been included in our consolidated results. comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold, or that incurred business interruption due to significant property damage or large scale capital improvements. we also present revpar separately for our comparable consolidated domestic and international (both on a nominal and constant dollar basis) hotels, as well as for our joint venture in europe. we provide revpar results in constant currency due to the number of consolidated properties we have internationally and the effect that exchange rates have on our reporting. we use constant currency because we believe it is useful to investors as it provides clarity on how the hotels are performing in their local markets. for all other measures (net income, operating profit, ebitda, ffo, etc.) our discussion refers to nominal us$, which is consistent with our financial statement presentation under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").
40
we also evaluate the performance of our business through certain non-gaap financial measures. each of these non-gaap financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to gaap performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit, net income and earnings per share. we provide a more detailed discussion of these non-gaap financial measures, how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in "-non-gaap financial measures." our non-gaap financial measures include:
•   nareit funds from operations ("ffo") and adjusted ffo per diluted share. we use nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share as supplemental measures of company-wide profitability. nareit adopted ffo in order to promote an industry-wide measure of reit operating performance. we also adjust nareit ffo for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, acquisition costs and litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business.

•   comparable hotel ebitda. hotel ebitda measures property-level results before debt service, depreciation and corporate expenses (as this is a property level measure) and is a supplemental measure of aggregate property-level profitability. we use hotel ebitda and associated margins to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels.

•   ebitda and adjusted ebitda. earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") is a supplemental measure of our operating performance and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits, hotel owners who are not reits and other capital-intensive companies. we also adjust ebitda for gains and losses related to real estate transactions, impairment losses and litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business ("adjusted ebitda").

revenue per available room in 2016, on a constant us$ basis, revpar at our comparable hotels increased 2.7% compared to 2015, representing the seventh consecutive year of positive revpar growth. throughout the year, increased group and leisure business helped push occupancy to near record levels for our company. however, reduced corporate profits and political and economic uncertainty led to a slowdown in corporate transient demand, limiting growth in average rates, as the business mix shifted from higher-rated corporate demand to lower-rated discount business. during the first half of the year, we also benefited from less disruption from renovations at several of our comparable properties. at the same time, supply growth exceeded historic cumulative average growth, particularly in many of our major markets, including new york, houston and boston. softening inbound travel from international markets due to the relative strength of the u.s. dollar also put pressure on demand in our major markets. these trends, coupled with increased price transparency from online travel agencies, have inhibited room rate growth.
revpar growth in 2016 was both rate and occupancy driven, as room rates improved 1.0% on a constant us$ basis and occupancy improved 130 basis points to 78.5%. group revenue increased 4.5%, driven by a 2.1% increase in room nights coupled with a 2.4% increase in rates. meanwhile, transient demand was hampered by softening business travel and reduced international travel. transient revenues increased 1.2% for the year driven by a 0.7% increase in average rate and a 0.5% increase in room nights sold.
comparable revpar at our domestic portfolio increased 2.5% for the year, driven by a 130 basis point improvement in occupancy and a 0.8% improvement in room rates. los angeles, washington, d.c., and san diego led our domestic portfolio with revpar increases of 8.8%, 6.7%, and 5.5%, respectively, driven by improvements in both occupancy and room rates in each of the markets. our new york and houston markets lagged the portfolio with revpar decreases of 3.0% and 1.1%, respectively, during the year primarily due to the recent influx of new supply, the impact of which will continue into 2017.
on a constant us$ basis, revpar at our comparable consolidated international hotels outperformed our portfolio in 2016 with an increase of 7.8%, led by our latin american properties, which recorded a 15.2% increase in revpar. our rio de janeiro properties benefited from the 2016 olympics and paralympics, while the jw marriott hotel mexico city also experienced strong improvement in average rate. our canadian properties outperformed driven by increased group business in both calgary and toronto. comparable revpar in constant euros for the unconsolidated euro jv properties decreased 2.0% for the year. the decrease was due to slow economic growth and an uncertain political climate that reduced demand, particularly at the joint venture's properties in brussels and paris, where operations have yet to return to levels seen prior to the terrorist attacks in those cities.
rooms total rooms revenues increased 0.8% for the full year, reflecting the 2.7% increase in comparable revpar on a constant dollar basis, partially offset by lost revenue from our 2016 and 2015 hotel dispositions and currency translation effects for our international
42
properties. total room expenses decreased by 1.0%, primarily reflecting hotel sales as well as our focus on cost controls. comparable room revenues increased 2.9% for the full year, while comparable room expenses increased only 1.4%, as operators were able to drive profitability through improved productivity.
food and beverage food and beverage revenues increased 2.0% for 2016, reflecting the 1.7% increase at our comparable hotels. the increase was driven primarily by growth in banquet and audio visual revenues, which provide higher overall operating margins than outlet revenue, as catered functions generally are more profitable. total food and beverage expenses and comparable hotel food and beverage expenses increased a moderate 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively, which allowed for strong profitability growth.
operating profit operating margins (calculated based on gaap operating profit as a percentage of gaap revenues) increased 80 basis points for the full year 2016. these operating margins are affected significantly by several items, including dispositions, depreciation, and corporate expenses. our comparable hotel ebitda margins, which exclude these items, also increased 80 basis points to 27.8%. the improvements in both gaap operating profit margins and comparable hotel ebitda margins were driven by improvement in higher margin group business throughout the year, coupled with increases in attrition and cancellation fees, decreases in utility and insurance costs and the ability of our operators to improve productivity. we have focused on improving productivity at some of our largest hotels over the past two years by initiating time and motion studies. these studies have resulted in hotel managers establishing tighter labor model standards and improved and expanded forecasting tools, which allow managers to more effectively schedule labor based on demand and to minimize excess staffing, thereby reducing costs.
net income, adjusted ebitda and adjusted ffo per diluted share net income for host inc. increased $206 million in 2016 to $771 million due primarily to the improvements in operations, a $158 million increase in gains on dispositions, and a decrease in interest expense, including a decrease of $41 million of debt extinguishment costs, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense and a decline in equity in earnings of affiliates, as the euro jv sold nine hotels in 2015. we also recorded a gain of $12 million for proceeds received for the disruption of operations at the new orleans marriott caused by the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill. as a result, host inc.'s diluted income per common share improved 37.8% to $1.02. adjusted ffo per diluted share, which excludes gains on dispositions, debt extinguishment costs, and other real estate transactions, including depreciation, increased 9.7% to $1.69 per share. net income, nareit and adjusted ffo and the related per share measures benefited from the following:
•   adjusted ebitda increased $62 million to $1,471 million, reflecting improvement in hotel operations, despite a net reduction due to property transactions, including the european joint venture's 2015 hotel dispositions;

•   per share measures improved due to the purchase of 52 million shares during 2016 and 2015. the anti-dilutive effect of these purchases is computed on a weighted average basis.

the trends and transactions described above for host inc. affected host l.p., as the only significant difference between the host inc. and host l.p. statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the outside partners of host l.p. for the year, host l.p.'s net income increased $206 million to $771 million, and the diluted income per common unit increased 38.2% to $1.05 per common unit.
2017 outlook there is cautious optimism for the united states economy in 2017. in 2016, gdp growth slowed to approximately 1.6% while business investment declined slightly as uncertainty weighed on confidence and corporate demand. however, several economic indicators, including improving corporate profitability and strengthening consumer confidence, point to the potential for continued and possibly stronger growth this year.  additionally, the new administration and congress have signaled or proposed several initiatives, such as a decrease in corporate taxation, lower regulatory burdens and an increase in infrastructure spending that may result in increased business investment, although the timing of any increases remains uncertain.  at the same time, there is an expectation that u.s. monetary policy will tighten in 2017, leading to an increase in interest rates and further strengthening for the u.s. dollar, which could lead to continued softening of international travel to the united states.
based on these trends, we anticipate that u.s. travel demand will remain stable in the near-term. strengthening consumer confidence and strong employment numbers have the potential to buoy the transient travel segment. additionally, demand for our
43
lodging portfolio of upper-upscale properties in major markets is highly correlated to business investment, which we anticipate will strengthen in 2017. however, supply growth significantly accelerated in 2016, and this trend is expected to continue into 2017. in particular, the markets in which we own a significant number of our hotels have experienced above-average supply growth during this cycle. the continued increase in supply will limit our managers' ability to grow room rate in the near-term and could lead to slight declines in occupancy. additionally, rate growth is inhibited by the increasing popularity of online sharing sites such as airbnb as well as online booking sites which increase price transparency.
as a result of these trends, we anticipate that we will continue to experience high levels of occupancy in 2017. in january 2017, comparable revpar increased 7.4% for the month, on a constant u.s. dollar basis, primarily driven by the performance of the washington, d.c. market, which benefited from the presidential inauguration and women's march. however, the continued pressures from increased supply are expected to inhibit rate growth, leading to limited revpar improvement for the remainder of the year. as a result, we anticipate revpar growth for our comparable hotels on a constant dollar basis of between 0.0% and 2.0% for the full year 2017. additionally, comparisons between our 2016 and 2017 results will be affected by our recent dispositions, as in 2016 we recognized revenues of $166 million, net income (excluding gain on sale) of $21 million, and adjusted ebitda of $37 million for the ten properties sold in 2016 and one property sold year-to-date 2017.
as noted above, the current outlook for the lodging industry is uncertain; therefore, there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, slower than anticipated growth in the economy and changes in travel patterns. see part i item 1a. "risk factors."
strategic initiatives we have executed on nearly $500 million of asset dispositions in 2016, and another $172 million through february 20, 2017. we also were able to complete several value enhancement, redevelopment and return on investment initiatives. the proceeds generated from our hotel dispositions, coupled with cash from operations, allowed us to distribute a total of $814 million to our stockholders through common dividends and common stock repurchases. subsequent to year end we acquired the don cesar for $214 million.
for 2017, we intend to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation to strengthen our portfolio and deliver stockholder value. we intend to take advantage of our strong capital position and overall scale to acquire upper-upscale, luxury, and high-quality select-service properties, through single asset or portfolio acquisitions, that we believe have sustainable competitive advantages to drive long-term value. at the same time, we will opportunistically sell assets. we also continue to critically analyze our portfolio to take advantage of the inherent value of our real estate holdings for its highest and best use, such as the 2016 acquisition of the ground lease at our key bridge marriott, located along the potomac river overlooking washington, d.c. we anticipate that the level of capital intensive redevelopment projects will decline compared to 2016. we intend to deliver value to our stockholders through a meaningful dividend, and, depending on market conditions, may also execute on our recently authorized 2017 stock repurchase program, while looking to maintain our investment grade rating.
portfolio acquisitions.  in july 2016, we purchased the ground lease at the key bridge marriott for $54 million. the land is located along the potomac river, overlooking washington, d.c., and we currently are exploring further development and value enhancement opportunities for the asset.
on february 16, 2017, we purchased the don cesar and the related beach house suites in st. pete beach, florida for $214 million and selected davidson hotels & resorts as manager. the hotel has been recognized for excellence by historic hotels of america, with 347 rooms and suites along the florida gulf coast, award-winning dining options and over 38,000 square feet of meeting space.
dispositions.  we continue to strategically dispose of assets that we believe will experience lower growth and/or higher capital expenditures requirements. during 2016, we disposed of 10 properties for proceeds of approximately $467 million and recorded a gain on sale of $243 million. since we announced our strategy to exit the asia-pacific market in september 2015, we have sold all seven of our new zealand hotels for a total of approximately nz$257 million ($174 million), including the repayment of nz$105 million ($72 million) of mortgage debt. subsequent to year end, we sold the jw marriott desert springs resort & spa for $172 million, including the $12 million ff&e fund retained at the hotel.

capital investments value enhancement. we intend to enhance the value of our portfolio by identifying and executing strategies to achieve the highest and best use of all aspects of our properties. this initiative may include new relationships with independent operators that may be an improved fit for smaller or unique properties, extending ground leases, and developing or disposing of underutilized land connected to our properties. during 2016, we reached an agreement to franchise the westin cincinnati and selected hei hotels & resorts as the operator. including the selection of independent managers at six of our properties in 2015, we currently have 16 third-party managed hotels in our consolidated and joint venture portfolio.
capital expenditures projects. we continue to pursue opportunities to enhance asset value through select capital improvements, including projects that are designed to increase the eco-efficiency of our hotels, incorporate elements of sustainable design and replace aging equipment and systems with more efficient technology. capital expenditures have totaled approximately $2.7 billion over the past five years and, as a result, we believe that our properties are in a strong competitive position relative to their market competitors. during 2016, we completed renovations to 5,000 guestrooms, approximately 385,000 square feet of meeting space and approximately 182,000 square feet of public space.
•   redevelopment and return on investment expenditures. these projects are designed to increase cash flow and improve profitability by capitalizing on changing market conditions and the favorable location of our properties. approximately $226 million was spent on redevelopment and return on investment projects during 2016 compared to $275 million in 2015. significant projects included the following:

o   hyatt regency san francisco airport - we completed a comprehensive renovation of all of the guestrooms and over 60,000 square feet of meeting and public space, including the renovation and conversion of a restaurant into an additional 15,000 square feet of meeting space.

o   denver marriott tech center - a transformational renovation, including newly designed guestrooms, additional meeting and public space, and a new concept restaurant. the project includes sustainability features such as led lighting in guestrooms and public spaces, new energy-efficient hvac units in guestrooms and high efficiency hot water and boiler plant upgrades.

o   the phoenician - the significant renovation project is expected to be completed over a two-year period. the first phase, completed in 2016, included a redesign of the guest rooms and canyon suites and updates to the façade. the second phase is expected to be completed in 2017 and includes a complete redesign and renovation of the main public areas, pools, restaurant and newly constructed spa and fitness building.

o   marriott marquis san diego marina -the property now features 280,000 square feet of meeting space following completion of the construction of a 152,000 square foot exhibit hall encompassing ballrooms, grand foyers and outdoor event space overlooking the marina.

for 2017, we expect to spend between $90 million and $115 million for redevelopment and roi projects, representing a 54% decrease from 2016.
•   renewal and replacement capital expenditures. we spent $293 million and $383 million on renewal and replacement expenditures during 2016 and 2015, respectively. these expenditures are designed to ensure that our standards for product quality are maintained and to enhance the overall competitiveness of our properties in the marketplace. projects that were completed during 2016 included rooms renovations at the ritz-carlton, marina del rey, houston marriott medical center, coronado island marriott resort &amp; spa, w seattle and the ritz-carlton, tysons corner. we also renovated a 40,000 square foot ballroom at the hyatt regency reston, the ballroom at marina del rey marriott and a restaurant at each of the manchester grand hyatt san diego and the ritz-carlton, amelia island. at the hyatt regency maui resort &amp; spa, we renovated over 65,000 square feet of meeting and public space, including a restaurant, the ballroom and event lawn.

we expect that our investment in renewal and replacement expenditures in 2017 will total approximately $275 million to $300 million. these projects will include phase two of a rooms renovation at the toronto marriott downtown eaton centre hotel, a rooms renovation at san francisco marriott fisherman's wharf, meeting space renovations at jw marriott atlanta buckhead and a ballroom renovation at new orleans marriott.
return of capital stock repurchase program and dividends. host inc.'s board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program for 2017 under which we can repurchase up to $500 million of common stock. the common stock may be purchased from time to time,
45
depending upon market conditions, and repurchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions or by other means, including through one or more trading plans designed to comply with rule 10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. the number of shares to be purchased also will depend upon operating results, funds generated by sales activity, dividends that may be required by those sales and investment options that may be available, including reinvesting in the portfolio or acquiring new hotels, as well as maintaining our strong leverage position. the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. the program replaces the previous stock repurchase program that expired on december 31, 2016. during 2016, we repurchased 13.8 million shares at an average price of $15.79 for a total purchase price of approximately $218 million. approximately 0.7 million of the purchases were in the fourth quarter at an average price of $15.82 per share.
during 2016, host inc.'s board of directors declared dividends of $0.85 per share with respect to host inc.'s common stock, an increase of 6.3% over the prior year. accordingly, host l.p. made a distribution of $0.868270 per unit with respect to its common op units for 2016. on february 21, 2017, the board of directors authorized a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share on its common stock. the dividend will be paid on april 17, 2017, to stockholders of record on march 31, 2017. the amount of any future dividend will be determined by host inc.'s board of directors.
there can be no assurances that any future dividends or stock buybacks will match or exceed those set forth above for any number of reasons, including a decline in operations or an increase in liquidity needs. we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets in order to meet our near-term debt maturities, fund our capital expenditures programs and take advantage of investment opportunities.
financing transactions we executed successfully on our strategy to decrease our leverage as measured by our net debt to ebitda ratio and to reduce our debt service obligations, leading to an increase in our interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and an investment grade rating for host l.p.'s senior notes. these improvements were due to stronger operations, successful acquisitions and other investments, the majority of which were completed with available cash and proceeds from equity issuances, and the repayment and refinancing of debt in order to extend maturity dates and obtain lower interest rates.
during 2016, we repaid $137 million of mortgage debt and had net repayments under the revolver portion of our credit facility of $82 million. at december 31, 2016, our weighted average interest rate is 3.8% and our weighted average debt maturity is 5.2 years. we have a debt balance of $3.6 billion and a balanced maturity schedule wherein not more than 23% of our outstanding debt, representing 4% of our u.s. gaap gross asset value, is due in any given year. assuming the exercise of credit facility extensions, we have no significant debt maturities until 2019.

the following graph summarizes our aggregate debt maturities as of february 21, 2017:

statement of operations results and trends for 2016 and 2015, the following items have affected the year-over-year comparability of our operations.
•   the results of hotels acquired or sold during the comparable periods (collectively, our "recent acquisitions and dispositions") had a significant impact on year-over-year comparisons. our operations were affected by the sale of ten hotels in 2016, eight hotels in 2015 and five hotels in 2014. these dispositions were partially offset by the acquisition or new development of five hotels during this timeframe: the phoenician acquired in june 2015, the axiom hotel acquired in january 2014, the yve hotel miami acquired in august 2014 and the ibis and novotel rio de janeiro parque olimpico hotels, which opened in the fourth quarter of 2014. the table below presents the effects on earnings from our recent acquisitions and dispositions (in millions, increase (decrease)):

•   in 2016, we had fewer disruptive renovations compared to 2015, which benefited the year-over-year growth in net income when compared to 2015. additionally, in 2016, we had a full year of operations for four hotels that had been closed for portions of 2015 for redevelopment. conversely, in 2015, our results were significantly more impacted by disruptive renovations than in 2014, which reduced growth in net income when compared to the prior year.

•   our domestic hotel portfolio represents approximately 97% of our revenues and assets. however, for international properties and our international joint ventures, we are exposed to currency exchange risks in the normal course of business. we further reduced our currency exchange risk in 2016 through the disposition of six international properties. the table below presents the overall currency impact for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions, increases (decrease)):

•   on january 1, 2015, our operators adopted the 11th edition of usali, which reclassifies certain hotel-level revenue and expense items. reclassifications include, among other items, certain service charges, all of which now are reflected on a gross basis, and group rebates, which now are reflected as a reduction to revenue. the 2014 results were not restated for these changes and therefore impact our 2015 comparative operating results. for 2015, we estimate the adoption of usali decreased rooms revenue growth by 20 basis points, increased comparable f&amp;b revenues growth by approximately 270 basis points, decreased other revenue growth by 10 basis points and reduced comparable hotel ebitda margins by 15 basis points. the adoption of usali did not impact net income, comparable hotel ebitda, or adjusted ebitda.

the increases in total revenues in 2016 of $80 million and $29 million in 2015 were driven by increases of 2.8% and 3.2% in revenues for our comparable properties, respectively. total revenues were impacted by our non-comparable properties that were under renovation and our recent acquisitions and dispositions.  additionally, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and the relative strength of the u.s. dollar reduced the increase in total revenues by 15 basis points in 2016 and 80 basis points in 2015.
rooms. rooms revenues increased $27 million and $13 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, reflecting an increase in constant dollar revpar of 2.7% and 3.7%, respectively, at our comparable hotels. currency fluctuations reduced year-over-year rooms revenues growth by 15 basis points in 2016 and 90 basis points in 2015. year-over-year comparisons also reflect a net decrease of $81 million in 2016 and $49 million in 2015 due to recent acquisitions and dispositions.
food and beverage. f&b revenues increased $31 million and $22 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. for our comparable hotels, f&b revenues increased 1.7% and 5.1%, respectively, for 2016 and 2015, driven by increases in banquet and audio visual revenues of 2.0% and 5.7% at our comparable hotels in 2016 and 2015, respectively. year-over-year comparisons also reflect a net decrease of $20 million for 2016 and $18 million for 2015 due to recent acquisitions and dispositions.
other revenues. other revenues increased $22 million, or 6.9%, in 2016. for our comparable hotels, other revenues increased 7.1% primarily driven by amenity fees revenue and attrition and cancellation fees. in 2015, other revenues decreased $6 million, primarily due to lower guest room telephone, internet, and spa and fitness center revenue, partially offset by an increase in attrition and cancellation fees.
property-level operating expenses the following table presents consolidated property-level operating expenses in accordance with gaap and includes both comparable and non-comparable hotels for the three years ended december 31, 2016 (in millions, except percentages):

operating expenses our operating costs and expenses, which consist of both fixed and variable components, are affected by a number of factors. rooms expense is affected mainly by occupancy, which drives costs related to items such as housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. food and beverage expenses correlate closely with food and beverage revenues, and is affected by occupancy and the mix of business between banquet and audio-visual and outlet sales. however, the most significant expense for both room and food and beverage is wages and employee benefits, which comprise approximately 56% of these expenses in any year. other property-level expenses consist of property taxes, which are highly dependent on local taxing authorities, and property and general liability insurance, and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels.

rooms. rooms expense decreased $9 million during 2016 and $22 million in 2015, reflecting the effect of recent acquisitions and dispositions. rooms expense at our comparable properties increased 1.4% in 2016 driven by increases in wages, benefits and group travel agent commissions.  in 2015, rooms expense at our comparable properties was flat, as improvements in hourly productivity offset wage rate growth of 2.4%. year-over-year comparisons also reflect a net decrease of $23 million in 2016 and $13 million in 2015 due to recent acquisitions and dispositions.
food and beverage. the increase in f&b expenses of $4 million in 2016 and $1 million in 2015 reflect year-over-year increases of 0.3% and 3.1% in comparable f&b expenses, respectively. overall, f&b hourly productivity was improved, which has led to declines in f&b costs as a percentage of revenues in 2016 and 2015. additionally, much of the revenue improvements were driven by increases in banquet and audio visual revenues, which have higher overall operating margins than outlet revenue. year-over-year comparisons also reflect a net decrease of $18 million in 2016 and $12 million in 2015 due to recent acquisitions and dispositions.
other departmental and support expenses. other departmental and support expenses increased $11 million and $31 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. for 2016, the increase primarily reflects increases in hourly wages and loyalty and reward program expenses, offset by a 6.4% decrease in administrative and general costs and an 8.1% decrease in utilities expense. the increase in 2015 primarily reflects growth in non-controllable expenses, including credit card fees and loyalty and reward programs. year-over-year comparisons also reflect a net decrease of $25 million in 2016 and $13 million in 2015 due to recent acquisitions and dispositions.
management fees. management fees, which generally are calculated as a percentage of revenues and operating profit, increased 4.4% for 2016 and decreased 0.4% for 2015. at our comparable hotels, base management fees, which are calculated as a percentage of total revenues, increased 1.0% in 2016 and 0.2% in 2015, and incentive management fees increased 14.8% in 2016 and 12.1% in 2015. the increase in both base and incentive management fees at our comparable hotels reflects the improvements in hotel operations. year-over-year comparisons also include a net decrease of $6 million in 2016 and $3 million in 2015 from recent acquisitions and dispositions.
other property-level expenses. these expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance. other property-level expenses decreased $4 million, or 1.0%, in 2016, and increased $9 million, or 2.4%, in 2015. other property-level expenses at our comparable hotels increased 2.1% and 3.5% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. both reflect an increase in property taxes and ground rent, partially offset by a decline in utilities and insurance expense, while the year-over-year changes for total other property-level expenses also reflect a net decrease of $6 million in 2016 and $2 million in 2015 from our recent acquisitions and dispositions.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization expense increased $16 million, or 2.3%, to $724 million in 2016 and increased $15 million, or 2.2%, to $708 million in 2015. the increases in depreciation and amortization expense reflect the depreciation of our recent capital expenditures, partially offset by a decrease due to recent acquisitions and dispositions.
other income and expense corporate and other expenses. corporate and other expenses include the following items (in millions):

general and administrative costs primarily consist of wages and benefits, travel, corporate insurance, legal fees, audit fees, building rent and systems costs. the 2016 corporate and other expenses include approximately $10 million of severance costs to be paid to our prior chief executive officer. for 2015, corporate expenses, excluding litigation (recoveries) accruals and acquisition costs, decreased 6% or $6 million, as 2014 included a $69 million reversal of a loss contingency upon the successful resolution of the litigation related to the ground lease for the san antonio marriott rivercenter. additionally, the decrease in the non-cash stock-based compensation expense in 2015 reflects the decline in our stock price and a decline in the number of shares earned.
gain on insurance and business interruption settlements. we received $12 million of business interruption proceeds in 2016 from a facility funded by bp for the disruption of operations at the new orleans marriott caused by the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill. in 2015, we recorded a gain of $2 million for the receipt of the final settlement related to the earthquake in christchurch, new zealand in february 2011.
50
interest expense. interest expense decreased $73 million, or 32.2%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, due to the reduction of debt extinguishment costs as well as a reduction in the overall debt balance. interest expense increased $20 million, or 9.7%, in 2015, due to a $37 million increase in debt extinguishment costs, offset by the decline in our weighted average interest rate. the following table presents certain components of interest expense (in millions):

___________
(1)   total cash interest expense paid was $144 million, $207 million, and $182 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which includes an increase (decrease) due to the change in accrued interest of $(3) million, $12 million and $1 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(2)   represents amortization of the previously deferred gain related to the land contributed to the maui jv.

equity in earnings of affiliates.  equity in earnings of affiliates primarily reflects our interest in the operations of the euro jv and our domestic joint ventures owning three hotels and a vacation ownership project. upon adoption of asu no. 2015-02, amendments to the consolidation analysis on january 1, 2016, the results of the fort lauderdale marriott harbor beach resort & spa no longer are consolidated and now are included in equity in earnings of affiliates. we applied the standard retrospectively. for additional information see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 1. summary of significant accounting policies." the decrease in equity in earnings of affiliates in 2016 and the increase in 2015 primarily reflects the gain on sale of nine properties in 2015 by the euro jv. the increase in equity in earnings in 2015 also reflects an increase in sales of timeshare units by the maui jv, partially offset by the effect of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar on our international joint venture operations.
benefit (provision) for income taxes. we lease substantially all of our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as trs for federal income tax purposes. the difference between hotel-level operating cash flow and the aggregate rent paid to host l.p. by the trs represents taxable income or loss, on which we record an income tax provision or benefit. the tax provision in 2016
51
primarily relates to domestic and foreign corporate income taxes on hotel operations and $9 million for capital gain tax on the sale of our two properties in chile.  the decrease in 2015 from the prior year reflects a decrease in taxable income at the trs due to an increase in rent expense in excess of the increase in operating profit from the hotels and a reduction of certain foreign taxes.
comparable hotel sales overview while management evaluates the performance of each individual hotel against its competitive set in a given market, we evaluate our overall portfolio operating results using three different criteria: geographic market, property type (i.e. urban, suburban, resort/conference or airport), and mix of business (i.e. transient, group or contract). as of december 31, 2016, 88 of our 96 owned hotels have been classified as comparable hotels. see "comparable hotel operating statistics" for a complete description of our comparable hotels.

our top performing domestic markets for the year were los angeles and washington, d.c. our los angeles properties led our domestic portfolio with an overall revpar increase of 8.8%, primarily due to rate growth of 5.6%, as strong group demand enabled our operators to drive rate growth. our washington, d.c. market benefited year over year from the 2015 renovations and strong citywide group demand, resulting in rate growth of 3.2% combined with a 250 basis point increase in occupancy.
many of our other west coast markets also outperformed the portfolio, including san diego, hawaii and san francisco. the mlb all-star game and comic-con led to an increase in city-wide room nights and strong group business at our san diego properties. at our hawaiian properties, strong group and transient demand in the market due to a combination of the zika virus threat in the caribbean and south america, terrorism concerns in europe and lower airfare prices all led to revpar growth of 4.7%. revpar growth at our properties in san francisco was due solely to rate growth of 3.0%, primarily due to super bowl demand earlier this year, while occupancy remained flat as many of our properties were negatively impacted by the construction at the moscone convention center (which will continue until 2018). the phoenix market was in line with our portfolio as average rate increased 2.8% and occupancy remained flat. meanwhile, in seattle, revpar was affected negatively by rooms renovation at the w seattle where occupancy declined by 840 basis points, and difficult comparisons to 2015 when the city hosted the u.s. golf association open championship.
in the southern and central u.s., our atlanta, chicago and denver markets outperformed our portfolio due to a combination of rate improvement and an increase in occupancy. in atlanta and denver, our properties benefited from a number of citywide events during the year, while our chicago properties benefited from completed renovations and strong group demand. meanwhile, revpar at our florida and houston hotels underperformed our portfolio. concerns over the spread of the zika virus contributed to declines in both group and leisure travel at our florida properties. our houston properties continued to be affected by disruption in the oil markets and increasing market supply.
on the east coast, our boston and new york hotels underperformed our portfolio. in boston, there were fewer citywide events, with weakening demand from the financial services and pharmaceutical sectors. in new york, supply growth has continued to negatively impact our hotels, as well as the strong u.s. dollar, resulting in a decline in european travel, trends we expect to continue into 2017.
on a constant dollar basis, our international markets experienced revpar growth of 7.8%, led by our latin american properties with double digit revpar growth of 15.2% due to the 2016 olympics and paralympics in brazil and the formula 1 and nfl events in mexico.

our airport properties led the portfolio for the year, driven by a combination of strong rate growth of 3.2% and an increase in occupancy of 330 basis points. in particular, the newark airport had an increase in occupancy of 13.9 percentage points due to lower occupancy in 2015 when the hotel was completing renovations, and westin los angeles airport had rate growth of 11.8% due to new crew business. our suburban properties also outperformed the portfolio driven by rate growth of 3.4%, as high occupancy levels in urban markets helped drive demand toward adjacent suburban markets. improvements in occupancy at our urban properties resulted in revpar growth of 1.8%, while average rate remained flat. our resort properties outperformed the portfolio with rate growth of 2.3% and a slight increase in occupancy of 40 basis points, driven by our california and hawaii resorts.

hotel sales by business mix.
our customers fall into three broad categories:  transient, group and contract business. the information below is derived from business mix results from 88 comparable hotels for which 2016 and 2015 business mix information is available. in 2016, overall revenue growth was due to both group and transient growth. overall, group revenues improved 4.5% compared to the prior year, consisting of a 2.4% average room rate increase coupled with a 2.1% growth in group room nights sold. our hotels were able to drive group business through higher-rated association business, which led to a 7.5% increase in revenue. corporate group revenue increased 5.8% while government and leisure group declined 2.9%. revenue from our transient business increased 1.2%, reflecting an increase of 0.7% in average rate and 0.5% in room nights sold. special corporate rooms declined 3.6%, as weakness in corporate business travel resulted in a negative mix shift, as operators replaced higher rated corporate business with lower rated business, such as contract, discount or government.

our west coast markets continued to perform well in 2015, as san francisco, seattle, los angeles and san diego all had revpar increases of between 8% and 9.3%. our san diego properties led our domestic portfolio, with a revpar increase of 9.3% as strong group demand allowed our operators to focus business towards the higher-rated transient and group business, leading to a 6.9% improvement in average daily rate. similarly, strong transient demand coupled with solid group business has allowed our operators to focus on higher-rated transient customers in all of our west coast markets. at our hawaiian properties, average occupancy increased 4.5 percentage points due to strong group and transient demand, while average rate declined 0.5%.
the boston market led our east coast markets as strong citywide demand, coupled with successful property specific promotional campaigns, led to increases in both transient and group demand. conversely, in new york, new hotel supply coupled with a reduction

in international demand as a result of a strong dollar has led to a revpar decline of 1.7%. revpar grew just 0.1% in our dc market due to the absorption of new supply, a decline in citywide events during the second half of the year and significant renovation projects that were completed during the first half of 2015 at our grand hyatt washington and jw marriott washington dc.
in our south and central markets, atlanta and florida outperformed the portfolio with revpar growth of 7.8% and 7.1%, respectively. in atlanta, renovations completed last year at the westin buckhead atlanta and grand hyatt atlanta in buckhead led to strong rate growth. in florida, strong group demand led to the 5.9% rate improvement and average occupancy of approximately 74%. the chicago market was generally in-line with the portfolio. during the first half of the year, the market outperformed the portfolio driven by strong city-wide demand. however, as the year progressed, group demand declined, leading our operators to rely on discounted transient business. revpar for our houston properties declined 7.4% due to disruption in the oil markets during 2015, which significantly hampered demand, as well as increasing market supply and the renovation at the houston marriott medical center hotel.
on a constant dollar basis, our international markets experienced revpar growth of 2.2%, led by our latin america properties with revpar growth of 9.1%, on a constant dollar basis, as strong group demand and renovations completed in 2014 led to improvements at our mexico property, while the jw marriott rio de janeiro benefited from the weak real during the year; despite difficult comparisons to the world cup in 2014. our canadian properties, in particular calgary, were affected negatively by falling oil prices and disruption from renovations, which led to a revpar decrease of 10.6% for 2015.

our suburban properties led the portfolio for the year with revpar growth of 7.8% driven by average rate growth of 6.6%. continuing a trend from prior year, high occupancy and average room rate in urban markets has helped to drive demand in adjacent suburban markets. our airport properties experienced revpar growth of 6.4%, driven by strong average rate growth at our west coast airport properties. the revpar improvement at our resort properties of 4.9% was driven by a 3.3% increase in average rate and improvement in occupancy of 110 basis points. our urban properties lagged the portfolio, with a revpar increase of 1.2%, average rate increase of 1.0% and a 20 basis point growth in occupancy. our urban properties were affected negatively by weakness in the washington, d.c., new york, and houston markets.
hotel sales by business mix.
the information below is derived from business mix results from 86 comparable hotels for which 2015 and 2014 business mix information is available. in 2015, overall revenue growth was due to both group and transient growth. revenue from our transient business increased 4.0%, reflecting an increase of 3.5% in average rate and a slight increase in room nights sold. non-qualified discount transient room nights increased 9.3%, while lower-rated special corporate and government segments decreased 2.6%. overall, group revenues improved 3.9% compared to the prior year, consisting of a 2.9% average room rate increase coupled with a 0.9% growth in group room nights sold. corporate group revenue growth of 5.8% and association group revenue growth of 3.9% was offset partially by government and leisure growth of 0.2%.

liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources of host inc. and host l.p. the liquidity and capital resources of host inc. and host l.p. are derived primarily from the activities of host l.p., which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations, the incurrence of debt, the issuance of op units or the sale of properties. host inc. is a reit and its only significant asset is the ownership of partnership interests of host l.p.; therefore, its financing and investing activities are conducted through host l.p., except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock. proceeds from stock issuances by host inc. are contributed to host l.p. in exchange for op units. additionally, funds used by host inc. to pay dividends or to repurchase stock are provided by host l.p. therefore, while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between host inc. and host l.p., we have not included a separate discussion of liquidity and capital resources as the discussion applies both to host inc. and host l.p.
overview. we look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity in order to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry. we believe this strategy will result in a lower overall cost of capital, allow us to complete opportunistic investments and acquisitions and will position us to manage potential declines in operations throughout the lodging cycle. over the past several years, we have decreased our leverage as measured by our net debt-to-ebitda ratio and reduced our debt service obligations, leading to an increase in our fixed charge coverage ratio.
we intend to use available cash predominantly for acquisitions or other investments in our portfolio. if we are unable to find appropriate investment opportunities, we will consider other uses, such as a return of capital through dividends or common stock repurchases, the amounts of which will be determined by our operations and other market factors. significant factors we review to determine the amount and timing of common stock repurchases include the current stock price compared to our determination of the underlying value of our assets, current and forecast operating results and the completion of hotel sales.
we have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt. we have access to multiple types of financing as approximately 98% of our debt consists of senior notes and borrowings under our credit facility, none of which are collateralized by specific hotel properties. our senior unsecured debt is rated investment grade by moody's investor services, fitch ratings and standard & poor's rating service, which has allowed us to borrow capital at lower rates than previously achieved. in 2016, we did not issue any senior notes or incur any mortgage debt and repaid $137 million of mortgage debt. additionally, only one of our hotels is encumbered by mortgage debt.

we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our portfolio, withstand declines in operating cash flow, pay near-term debt maturities and fund our capital expenditures programs. we may continue to access the capital markets if favorable conditions exist in order to further enhance our liquidity and to fund cash needs. the table below details our significant cash flows for the three years ended december 31 (in millions):

cash requirements. we use cash for acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt payments, operating costs, corporate and other expenses, as well as dividends and distributions to stockholders and unitholders. as a reit, host inc. is required to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. funds used by host inc. to pay dividends are provided by host l.p. our primary sources of cash include cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of assets, borrowings under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances. assuming the exercise of credit facility extensions, we have no significant debt maturities until 2019.
capital resources. we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth, including acquisitions. as a result, the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure. our financial flexibility (including our ability to incur debt, make distributions and make investments) is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of such indebtedness, which include, among other things, the allowable amounts of leverage, interest coverage and fixed charges.
if, at any time, we determine that market conditions are favorable, after taking into account our liquidity requirements, we may cause host l.p. to issue senior notes or debentures exchangeable for shares of host inc. common stock. given our total debt level and maturity schedule, we also will continue to redeem or refinance senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time, taking advantage of favorable market conditions. in february 2017, host inc.'s board of directors authorized repurchases of up to $250 million of senior notes and mortgage debt other than in accordance with its terms. we may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date will affect earnings and nareit ffo per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs. in addition, while we intend to use any available cash predominantly for acquisitions or other investments in our hotel portfolio, to the extent we do not identify appropriate investments, we may elect in the future to use available cash for other purposes, including share repurchases, subject to market conditions. accordingly, in light of our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile and given prevailing conditions and relative pricing in the capital markets, we may, at any time, subject to applicable securities laws, be considering, or be in discussions with respect to the repurchase or issuance of exchangeable debentures and/or senior notes or the repurchase or sale of common stock. any such transactions may, subject to applicable securities laws, occur simultaneously.
58
we continue to explore potential acquisitions and anticipate that any such future acquisitions will be funded primarily by proceeds from sales of properties, but also potentially from equity offerings of host inc., issuances of op units by host l.p., incurrence of debt, available cash or advances under our credit facility. given the nature of these transactions, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotels that we may review, bid on or negotiate to purchase. we may acquire additional properties through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures and acquisitions of the securities or assets of other reits.
counterparty credit risk. we are subject to counterparty credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. we assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligation to determine the impact, if any, of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition. we are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions, access to our credit facility and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts. our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited. our exposure with regard to our cash and the available capacity under the revolver portion of our credit facility is mitigated, as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions. at december 31, 2016, the exposure risk related to our derivative contracts totaled $12 million and the counterparties were investment grade financial institutions.
sources and uses of cash. in 2016, our primary sources of cash included cash from operations, proceeds from asset sales, draws on our credit facility and returns from equity investments. our primary uses of cash during the year consisted of acquisitions, capital expenditures, operating costs, debt repayments, common stock repurchases and distributions to equity holders. we anticipate that our sources and uses of cash will be similar during 2017.
cash provided by operations. our cash provided by operations for 2016 increased $144 million to $1,303 million compared to 2015, reflecting improved operations at our hotels and a decrease in cash interest and debt extinguishment costs.
cash used in investing activities. approximately $115 million of cash was used in investing activities during 2016 compared to $732 million in 2015. in addition to the acquisition and disposition activity detailed in the charts below, we spent approximately $519 million on capital expenditures, compared to $658 million in 2015. our renewal and replacement capital expenditures for 2016 were approximately $293 million, which reflects a decrease of approximately 23% from 2015 levels. our renewal and replacement capital expenditures generally are funded by the furniture, fixture and equipment funds established at certain of our hotels (typically 5% of property revenues) and by our available cash. we also spent approximately $226 million in 2016 on roi/redevelopment capital expenditures, which reflects a decrease of approximately 18% compared to 2015 levels. additionally, we have capitalized certain internal costs and interest expense associated with our capital expenditures projects in accordance with gaap. these capitalized costs were $10 million, $13 million and $14 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. cash provided by investing activities totaled $503 million and $394 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and consisted of proceeds from the sale of ten hotels in 2016 and eight hotels in 2015, as well as the return of investment from joint ventures in both 2016 and 2015.

senior notes. the following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issued by host l.p., to which we refer collectively as the senior notes indenture. we pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi-annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above. under the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of host l.p.'s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of host l.p.
pledges and guarantees. under the senior notes indentures, all host l.p. subsidiaries which guarantee host l.p. debt are required to similarly guarantee debt issuances under the indenture. also, to the extent the equity of any subsidiaries of host l.p. is pledged to secure borrowings under the credit facility, such collateral likewise is required to secure senior note issuances under the senior notes indentures. while the credit facility currently does not include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests, such guarantees or pledges subsequently will be required in the event that host l.p.'s leverage ratio exceeds 6.0x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host l.p. does not have an investment grade long-term unsecured debt rating. in the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered, the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the credit facility, as well as the senior notes issued under the senior notes indenture and certain hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility. if triggered, the guarantees and pledges only would be required by certain u.s. and canadian subsidiaries of host l.p. and a substantial portion of our subsidiaries would not provide guarantees or pledges of equity interests. further, if at any time our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x for two consecutive fiscal quarters or host l.p. has an investment grade long-term unsecured debt rating, such guarantees and pledges may be released.
62
senior notes indenture covenants covenants for senior notes issued after we attained an investment grade rating no senior notes were issued in 2016. on october 14, 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of series f senior notes bearing interest at a rate of 4.5% per year due in 2026. the series f senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the february 1, 2026 maturity date, except at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium as set forth in the senior notes indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date.
on may 15, 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of series e senior notes bearing interest at a rate of 4% per year due in 2025. the series e senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the june 15, 2025 maturity date, except at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium as set forth in the senior notes indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date.
the series e and f senior notes were issued under a new senior notes indenture and have covenants customary for investment grade debt, primarily limitations on our ability to incur debt. there are no restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. these senior notes have covenants similar to our series d senior notes, but are different than the covenants applicable to our prior series of senior notes issued before we attained our investment grade rating.
under the terms of the series d, e and f senior notes, host l.p.'s ability to incur indebtedness is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an ebitda-to-interest coverage ratio of at least 1.5x by host l.p. as calculated, this ratio excludes from interest expense items such as call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on host l.p.'s consolidated statement of operations. in addition, the calculation is based on host l.p.'s pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters, giving effect to certain transactions, such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. other covenants limiting host l.p.'s ability to incur indebtedness include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values), maintaining secured indebtedness of less than 40% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values) and maintaining total unencumbered assets of at least 150% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured indebtedness of host l.p. and its subsidiaries. so long as host l.p. maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, it may incur additional debt.
we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants applicable to our series d, e and f senior notes. the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture for our series d, e and f senior notes and our actual credit ratios as of december 31, 2016:
actual ratio         covenant requirement

unencumbered assets tests                          526   %   minimum ratio of 150%
total indebtedness to total assets                  19   %   maximum ratio of 65%
secured indebtedness to total assets             &lt;1   %   maximum ratio of 40%
ebitda-to-interest coverage ratio                 10.1   x   minimum ratio of 1.5x covenants for senior notes issued before we attained an investment grade rating currently, our senior notes have an investment grade rating from both moody's and standard & poor's. as a result, many of the restrictive covenants contained in the senior notes indenture and the supplemental indentures for our prior series of senior notes are not applicable, as they do not apply for so long as such series of notes maintain an investment grade rating from both moody's and standard & poor's. the following primary covenants continue to apply to our existing senior notes (other than our series d, e and f senior notes):
•   restrict our ability to sell all or substantially all of our assets or merge with or into other companies; and

•   require us to make an offer to repurchase the existing senior notes then currently outstanding upon the occurrence of a change of control.

if our senior notes are no longer rated investment grade by either or both of moody's and standard & poor's, then the following covenants and other restrictions will be reinstated for our senior notes (but will not apply to the series d, e and f senior notes which have different covenants):
•   our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions will be subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an ebitda-to­interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0x. we will be able to make

63
distributions to enable host inc. to pay dividends on its preferred stock, if any, under the senior notes indenture when our ebitda-to-interest coverage ratio is above 1.7 to 1.0. this ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture applicable to our non-investment grade senior notes based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, and amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan in order to establish the debt at fair value. these amounts are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations;

•   other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions would include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values), excluding intangible assets, and maintaining secured indebtedness and subsidiary indebtedness of less than 45% of adjusted total assets. so long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture applicable to our existing senior notes, we may make preferred or common op unit distributions and incur additional debt, including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition. even if we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and make distributions when our senior notes no longer are rated investment grade, we still will be permitted to incur certain types of debt, including (i) credit facility debt, (ii) refinancing debt, (iii) up to $400 million of mortgage debt, which proceeds would be used to repay debt under the credit facility (and permanently reduce our ability to borrow under the credit facility by such amount), and (iv) up to $150 million of other debt. we also will be permitted to make distributions of estimated taxable income that are necessary to maintain host inc.'s reit status;

•   a requirement to maintain unencumbered assets, based on undepreciated book values, of not less than 125% of the aggregate amount of senior note debt, plus other debt not secured by mortgages. this coverage requirement must be maintained at all times and is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to incur debt or make distributions discussed above (which consequences, where we fall below the coverage level, are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or make distributions, but which would not otherwise cause a default under our senior notes indenture); and

•   our ability to make distributions on, redeem or repurchase our op units; permit payment or distribution restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries; sell assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; and create certain liens will be restricted.

the following summarizes the actual credit ratios for our senior notes (other than the series d, e and f senior notes) as of december 31, 2016 and the covenant requirements contained in the senior notes indenture that would be applicable at such times as our senior notes no longer are rated investment grade by either of moody's or standard & poor's. even if we were to lose the investment grade rating, we would be in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the senior notes indenture:
actual ratio*         covenant requirement

unencumbered assets tests                          532   %   minimum ratio of 125%
total indebtedness to total assets                  19   %   maximum ratio of 65%
secured indebtedness to total assets             &lt;1   %   maximum ratio of 45%
ebitda-to-interest coverage ratio                 10.1   x   minimum ratio of 2.0x
___________
*   because of differences in the calculation methodology between our series d, series e and series f senior notes and our other senior notes, our actual ratios as reported can be slightly different.

exchangeable debentures. in 2009, host l.p. issued $400 million of 21⁄2% exchangeable senior debentures. in october 2015, host l.p. gave notice that it would redeem all of its currently outstanding debentures at a cash redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest. at the time, the debentures were exchangeable and the exchange price was equivalent to a host inc. share price of $12.45. based on host inc.'s then current stock price, the exchange value of the debentures exceeded the cash redemption price and holders of all but $1 million of the debentures elected to exchange their debentures for shares of host inc. common stock at the exchange value rather than receive the redemption price at par. as a result, we issued 32 million shares of host inc. common stock upon exchange (including $8.7 million of debentures that had elected to exchange in july 2015) and redeemed approximately $1 million of debentures for cash.
credit facility. on september 10, 2015, we entered into the third amended and restated senior revolving credit and term loan facility with bank of america, n.a., as administrative agent, jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as syndication agent, wells fargo bank, n.a., deutsche bank securities inc., the bank of nova scotia, the bank of new york mellon, credit agricole corporate & investment bank and goldman sachs bank usa as co-documentation agents, and certain other agents and lenders. the credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1 billion. the revolver also includes a foreign currency
64
subfacility for canadian dollars, australian dollars, new zealand dollars, japanese yen, euros and british pound sterling and, if available to the lenders, mexican pesos of up to the foreign currency equivalent of $500 million, subject to a lower amount in the case of new zealand dollar and mexican pesos borrowings. the credit facility also provides a term loan facility of $1 billion (which we have fully utilized), a subfacility of up to $100 million for swingline borrowings in u.s. dollars, canadian dollars, euros or british pounds sterling and a subfacility of up to $100 million for issuances of letters of credit. host l.p. also has the option to increase the aggregate principal amount of the revolving credit facility and/or term loan facility of the credit facility by up to $500 million, subject to obtaining additional loan commitments and satisfaction of certain conditions.
the revolving credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of june 2018, with the option for host l.p. to extend the term for two additional six-month terms, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee and the accuracy of representations and warranties, and $500 million of term loans have an initial scheduled maturity of june 2017, with an option for host l.p. to extend the term for two additional years, subject to similar conditions. a second $500 million of term loans will mature in september 2020.
neither the revolving credit facility nor the term loans, as applicable, requires any scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity. the term loans otherwise are subject to the same terms and conditions as those in the credit facility regarding subsidiary guarantees and pledges of security interests in subsidiaries, operational covenants, financial covenants and events of default (as discussed below).
collateral and guarantees. the credit facility does not currently include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests in our subsidiaries or any other security, and the guarantees and pledges are required only in the event that host l.p.'s leverage ratio exceeds 6.0x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host l.p. does not have an investment grade long-term unsecured debt rating. in the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered, the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the credit facility, as well as the notes outstanding under host l.p.'s senior notes indenture, interest rate and currency hedges and certain other hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility. even when triggered, the guarantees and pledges only would be required by certain u.s. and canadian subsidiaries of host l.p. and a substantial portion of our subsidiaries would provide neither guarantees nor pledges of equity interests. further, if at any time our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x for two consecutive fiscal quarters or host l.p. has an investment grade long-term unsecured debt rating, such guarantees and pledges may be released.
prepayments. voluntary prepayments of revolver borrowings and term loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty. the loans under the credit facility are required to be prepaid in the event that asset sales reduce adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values) to below $10 billion if we do not reinvest the proceeds of those asset sales in new properties. at december 31, 2016, we have adjusted total assets, as defined in our credit facility, of $19 billion.
financial covenants.  the credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage. we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of 7.25x, our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 1.75x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 1.25x. the financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility. hence, so long as there are no amounts outstanding thereunder and the term loans are repaid, we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the revolver portion of the credit facility in the future if we were ever to regain compliance with the financial covenants. these calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at issuance of a loan in order to establish its fair value and non-cash interest expense due to the implementation in 2009 of accounting standards relating to our exchangeable debentures, all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations. additionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a "net debt" concept, pursuant to which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million are deducted from our total debt balance.
we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility. the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility as of december 31, 2016:
actual ratio         covenant requirement for all years

leverage ratio                                      2.4   x   maximum ratio of 7.25x fixed charge coverage ratio                         7.8   x   minimum ratio of 1.25x unsecured interest coverage ratio (1)              10.9   x   minimum ratio of 1.75x
___________
65
(1)   if at any time our leverage ratio is above 7.0x, our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will be reduced to 1.5x.

interest and fees. we pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to libor plus a margin. the margin ranges from 87.5 to 155 basis points (depending on host l.p.'s unsecured long-term debt rating). we also pay a facility fee ranging from 12.5 to 30 basis points, depending on our rating and regardless of usage. based on host l.p.'s unsecured long-term debt rating as of december 31, 2016, we are able to borrow at a rate of libor plus 100 basis points and pay a facility fee of 20 basis points. interest on the term loans consists of floating rates equal to libor plus a margin ranging from 90 to 175 basis points (depending on host l.p.'s unsecured long-term debt rating). based on host l.p.'s long-term debt rating as of december 31, 2016, our applicable margin on libor loans under the 2014 term loan is 112.5 basis points. our applicable margin on the 2015 term loan for libor loans is 110 basis points.
other covenants and events of default. the credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, as currently is the case. in particular, at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures, and the limitations on acquisitions, investments, dividends and distributions contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture to the extent applicable, while our senior notes maintain an investment grade rating. additionally, the credit facility's restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends and distributions generally are consistent with our senior notes indenture. these provisions, under certain circumstances, limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing, and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain host inc.'s tax status as a reit.
the credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature, and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lenders' commitments may be terminated. in addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts due under the credit facility automatically will become due and payable and the lenders' commitments automatically will terminate.
mortgage and other debt. as of december 31, 2016, we had mortgage debt secured by one hotel, which represents 1% of our total revenues in 2016. all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets, except in instances of fraud, misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions. as of december 31, 2016, secured debt represented approximately 2% of our total debt and our aggregate secured debt had an average interest rate of 3.4% and an average maturity of less than one year.

mortgage debt of consolidated and unconsolidated partner interests. for the entities that we consolidate in our financial statements that have third party non-controlling partnership interests, the portion of mortgage debt included in the above table that is attributable to the non-controlling interests, based on their percentage of ownership of the ventures, is approximately $16 million. additionally, we have non-controlling interests in partnerships and joint ventures that are not consolidated and are accounted for under the equity method. the portion of the mortgage and other debt of these partnerships and joint ventures attributable to us, based on our ownership percentage thereof, was $392 million at december 31, 2016. the mortgage debt related to the hotels owned by our euro jv contains operating covenants that could result in the joint venture being required to escrow cash from operations or to make principal payments without penalty. the debt of our unconsolidated joint ventures, with the exception of the maui timeshare joint venture, is non-recourse to us. we have jointly and severally guaranteed a construction loan incurred by our maui timeshare joint venture. see "-off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations."
distribution/dividend. host inc.'s policy on common dividends generally is to distribute, over time, at least 100% of its taxable income, which primarily is dependent on our results of operations, as well as gains and losses on property sales. host inc. paid a
66
regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share and a special cash dividend of $0.05 per share on its common stock on january 17, 2017 to stockholders of record as of december 30, 2016. the $0.20 per share dividend represents host inc.'s intended regular quarterly cash dividend for the next several quarters, subject to board approval. while host inc. intends to use available cash predominantly for acquisitions or other investments in its portfolio, to the extent that we do not identify appropriate investments, we may elect in the future, subject to market conditions, to use available cash for other purposes, such as common stock repurchases or increased dividends, which dividends could be in excess of taxable income. any special dividend would be subject to approval by host inc.'s board of directors.
funds used by host inc. to pay dividends are provided through distributions from host l.p. as of december 31, 2016, host inc. is the owner of approximately 99% of host l.p.'s common op units. the remaining common op units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. each op unit may be offered for redemption by the holders for cash or, at the election of host inc., host inc. common stock based on the then current conversion ratio. the current conversion ratio is 1.021494 shares of host inc. common stock for each op unit.
investors should take into account the 1% non-controlling position of host l.p. op units when analyzing dividend payments by host inc. to its stockholders, as these holders of op units share, on a pro rata basis, in amounts being distributed by host l.p. to holders of its corresponding op units. for example, if host inc. paid a $1 per share dividend on its common stock, it would be based on the payment of a $1.021494 per common unit distribution by host l.p. to host inc., as well as to the other common op unitholders.
off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off-balance sheet arrangements. we are party to various transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements with unconsolidated entities (which we refer to as "off-balance sheet arrangements"), pursuant to which we have certain contingent liabilities and/or guarantees. contingencies included on our balance sheet are discussed in part ii item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 16. "guarantees and contingencies." as of december 31, 2016, we are party to the following material off-balance sheet arrangements:
european joint venture. the euro jv consists of two separate funds, with our partners apg and gic re. we serve as the general partner for the joint venture and have a combined general and limited partner interest of 32.1% with respect to euro jv fund i and 33.4% with respect to euro jv fund ii. due to the ownership structure and substantive participating rights of the non-host limited partners, including approval over financing, acquisitions and dispositions, and annual operating and capital expenditures budgets, the euro jv is not consolidated in our financial statements. as of december 31, 2016, the book value of the total assets of the euro jv are approximately €1.5 billion.
our investment and partners' funding as of december 31, 2016 is as follows:

(1)   the remaining commitment is limited to investments in the current portfolio of hotels, including capital expenditures and debt repayments.

in june 2016, the euro jv fund ii partners amended the euro jv partnership agreement to extend the equity commitment period for euro jv fund ii to june 27, 2017. the commitment period of euro jv fund i for acquisitions expired in december 2015. as asset manager of the euro jv funds, we earn an asset management fee based on the amount of equity invested, which in 2016, 2015 and 2014 aggregated approximately $8 million, $11 million and $16 million, respectively.

___________
(1)   the presentation above includes the operating performance for all 10 properties in the joint venture consisting of 3,896 rooms. see "-comparable hotel operating statistics."

the operating statistics of the hotels are presented in constant euros, the functional currency of the euro jv, in order to present the results without the effects of foreign currency exchange rates. the functional currency of the hotels owned in the united kingdom and sweden is the british pound sterling and swedish krona, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2016, the euro jv's comparable hotel revpar in constant euros decreased by 2.0%, which resulted in a decrease of total revenues of 1.4%.
for 2016, 2015 and 2014, our portion of the earnings of the euro jv was €7 million ($8 million), €51 million ($57 million) and €17 million ($21 million), respectively, and is included in equity in earnings of affiliates on our consolidated statements of operations. the earnings in 2015 and 2014 include €39 million ($43 million) and €3 million ($4 million) recognized on the sale of nine properties and one property, respectively, cash flows from operating activities of the euro jv were €62 million, €78 million and €69 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. future cash flows from operations primarily are expected to continue to be used to invest in the portfolio through capital expenditures, to fund other investments or distributions to partners.
during 2016, the euro jv distributed €47 million to its partners, of which host's share was €15 million ($18 million). the 2016 distributions were funded with the above mentioned cash from operations. during 2015, the euro jv distributed €328.5 million to its partners, of which host's share was €107 million ($115 million). ninety-two percent of the 2015 distributions were funded by proceeds from the hotel dispositions described below, while the remainder was funded with cash from operations. the euro jv invested approximately €23 million in both 2016 and 2015 and €21 million in 2014, in capital expenditures projects. the euro jv expects to spend between €20 million and €30 million on capital expenditures in 2017, none of which are expected to require additional partner contributions.
during 2015, the euro jv sold nine properties for €526 million and repaid €229 million of mortgage loans secured by the properties. net proceeds from the hotel sales were distributed to the partners and were used for other partnership investments.
the euro jv has €707 million of debt, all of which is non-recourse to us. a default of the euro jv mortgage debt does not trigger a default under any of our debt. during 2016, the euro jv completed amendments to two of its mortgage loan agreements, extending their maturity and reducing the overall weighted average interest rate by 20 basis points.
68
the following presents our portion of the euro jv debt maturities as of december 31, 2016 (in usd):
we have entered into four foreign currency forward sale contracts in order to hedge the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the euro jv. the forward purchases will occur between may 2017 and january 2018. we have hedged €177 million (approximately $199 million) of our investment via these contracts and have designated draws under our credit facility in euros. for additional detail on the foreign currency forward sale contracts and our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see part ii item 7a. "-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
asia/pacific joint venture. we have a 25% interest in the asia/pacific jv with reco hotels jv private limited, an affiliate of gic re. the agreement may be terminated by either partner at any time, which would trigger the liquidation of the jv. due to the ownership structure and the substantive participating rights of the non-host limited partner, including approval over financing, acquisitions and dispositions, and annual operating and capital expenditures budgets, the asia/pacific jv is not consolidated in our financial statements. the commitment period for equity contributions to the asia/pacific jv has expired. certain funding commitments remain, however, related to its existing investments in india.
as of december 31, 2016, the partners have invested approximately $103 million (of which our share was $26 million) in a separate joint venture in india with accor s.a. and interglobe enterprises limited, in which the asia/pacific jv holds a 36% interest. this joint venture owns five operating properties in delhi, bangalore and chennai and two additional properties in the final stages of completion in chennai, totaling approximately 1,750 rooms. the hotels currently are and will be managed by accorhotels under the pullman, ibis and novotel brands.
on october 14, 2015, the asia/pacific jv sold the four points by sheraton perth for a$91.5 million and repaid a$43 million of mortgage debt. the jv recorded a gain on sale of approximately a$11 million ($8 million). during 2016, we received distributions of approximately $9 million from the asia/pacific jv primarily related to the sale of the four points by sheraton perth.
maui joint venture. we have a 67% ownership interest in a joint venture with an affiliate of hv global group, a subsidiary of interval leisure group ("interval"), that owns a 131-unit vacation ownership development in maui, hawaii adjacent to our hyatt regency maui resort & spa (the "maui jv"). our ownership is a non-controlling interest as a result of the significant economic rights held by the interval member, which also is the managing member. since 2012, we have contributed approximately $87 million to the maui jv, which includes the contribution of land valued at $36 million. as of december 31, 2016, approximately $9 million was outstanding on the joint venture's construction loan, which is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and hyatt hotels corporation. during 2016, 2015 and 2014, the maui jv recognized $55 million, $76 million and $54 million, respectively, of sales of timeshare units.  we recognized earnings of $9 million, $11 million and $5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which includes our portion of the net income of the joint venture as well as a portion of the deferred gain from the contribution of the land.
hyatt place joint venture. we own a 50% interest in a joint venture with white lodging services that owns the 255-room hyatt place nashville downtown in tennessee. in august 2016, the joint venture refinanced its $31 million construction loan with a new $60 million mortgage loan due august 2019 with two 12-month extension options. the loan bears interest at 1-month usd libor plus 300 basis points, or 3.8%, at december 31, 2016. upon repayment of the construction loan, the partners were released of their
69
guarantee on such loan. during 2016, the joint venture also made distributions to its partners, of which we received $17 million. due to the significant control rights of our partner, we do not consolidate the joint venture in our financial statements.
harbor beach joint venture. we own a 49.9% interest in a joint venture with r/v-c association that owns the 650-room fort lauderdale marriott harbor beach resort & spa in florida. the joint venture has approximately $149 million of mortgage debt that is non-recourse to us. due to significant control rights of our partner, we do not consolidate the joint venture in our financial statements. during 2016, we received approximately $6 million of distributions from the joint venture as a result of excess cash from operations.
for additional discussion on each of our joint venture investments, see part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 3. "investments in affiliates."

___________
(1)   the amounts shown include amortization of principal, debt maturities and estimated interest payments. interest payments have been reflected based on the weighted average interest rate.

(2)   our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels. under our contracts, we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years.

(3)   the amounts shown include deferred management fees, obligations to third-parties related to prior property transactions and the estimated amount of tax expense related to uncertain tax liabilities.

tax sharing arrangements. under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies (such as marriott international, inc., hms host and barceló crestline corporation), we are obligated to pay certain taxes (federal, state, local and foreign, including any related interest and penalties) relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated with us. for example, a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that such former affiliate was owned by us. this adjustment could result in a tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement. additionally, under the partnership agreement between host inc. and host l.p., host l.p. is obligated to pay certain taxes (federal, state, local and foreign, including any related interest and penalties) incurred by host inc., as well as any liabilities the irs may successfully assert against host inc. we do not expect any amounts paid under these tax sharing arrangements to be material.
tax indemnification agreements. as a result of certain federal and state income tax considerations of the former owners of two hotels currently owned by host l.p., we have agreed to restrictions on selling such hotels, or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt, for varying periods. one of these agreements expires in 2028 and the other in 2031.
guarantees. we have entered into certain guarantees, which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt, that are not recorded on our books due to various dispositions, spin-offs and contractual arrangements, but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances, including default by an unrelated party. we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote. for a discussion of the largest guarantees (by dollar amount) see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 16. guarantees and contingencies."
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including
70
those related to the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing basis. we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. for a detailed discussion of the following critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 1. summary of significant accounting policies:"
•   business combinations;

•   property and equipment - impairment testing;

•   property and equipment - other-than-temporary impairment of an investment;

•   property and equipment - classification of assets as "held for sale";

•   depreciation and amortization expense;

•   derivative instruments;

•   basis of presentation and principles of consolidation;

•   foreign currency translation;

•   income taxes - deferred tax assets and liabilities. additionally, see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 6. income taxes" for more information; and

•   share based payments. additionally, see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 8. employee stock plans" for more information.

application of new accounting standards in february 2015, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2015-02, amendments to the consolidation analysis. the asu amends the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities (vies) and general partners' investments in limited partnerships and modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are vies or voting interest entities. the asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015. specifically, as a result of the elimination of the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and that these partnerships should be evaluated under the vie or voting interest model, we re-evaluated the vie determination of our non-wholly-owned partnerships. we adopted this standard on january 1, 2016, and applied the changes retrospectively. as a result, we no longer consolidate the partnership that owns the fort lauderdale marriott harbor beach resort & spa, of which we are the managing partner and hold 49.9% of the partnership interests, due to the voting rights of the third-party owner. accordingly, the operations, assets and liabilities of the hotel no longer are included in our consolidated financial statements. instead, we have included our interest in the hotel based on the carrying amount on january 1, 2015 in advances to and investments in affiliates and our portion of the hotel's earnings are recorded to equity in earnings of affiliates, with no cumulative-effect adjustment. as a result of the adoption of this asu, total assets and total liabilities at december 31, 2015 were reduced by $128 million and $150 million, respectively. in addition, for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, total revenues were reduced by $37 million and $33 million, respectively. net income decreased by $6 million for both years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014. the deconsolidation of this entity had no effect on the total equity of host inc. stockholders, total host l.p. capital or net income attributable to host inc. or host l.p.
additionally, three partnerships now are considered vie's, as the general partner maintains control over the decisions that most significantly impact the partnerships; however, this consideration did not change the consolidation determination.  this conclusion includes the operating partnership, host l.p., which is consolidated by host inc., of which host inc. is the general partner and holds 99% of the limited partner interests. host inc.'s sole significant asset is its investment in host l.p. and, consequently, substantially all of host inc.'s assets and liabilities represent assets and liabilities of host l.p. all of host inc.'s debt is an obligation of host l.p. and may be settled only with assets of host l.p. we also determined that our consolidated partnership that owns the houston airport marriott at george bush intercontinental, of which we are the general partner and hold 85% of the partnership interests, is a vie. the total assets of this vie at december 31, 2016 are $60 million and consist of cash and property and equipment. liabilities for the vie total $3 million and consist of accounts payable and deferred revenue. the unconsolidated partnership that owns the philadelphia marriott downtown, of which we hold 11% of the limited partner interests, also is a vie. the carrying amount of this investment at december 31, 2016 is $(6) million and is included in advances to and investments in affiliates. the mortgage debt held by this vie is non-recourse to us.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606). the new standard sets forth steps to determine the timing and amount of revenue to be recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects in exchange. in march, april, may and december 2016, the fasb issued asus
71
nos. 2016-08, 2016-10, 2016-12 and 2016-20, respectively, all related to revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606), which further clarify the application of the standard. in august 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-14, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): deferral of the effective date, which deferred the effectiveness of asu no. 2014-09 to reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017 and permitted early application for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. the new standards can be applied retrospectively or under a modified retrospective approach. based on our assessment of this standard, it will not materially affect the amount or timing of revenue recognition for revenues from room, food and beverage, and other hotel level sales; however, it may allow for earlier gain recognition for certain sale transactions under which we have continuing involvement. upon adoption, we expect to implement these standards using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect recognized and no prior period restatements.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842), which affects aspects of accounting for lease agreements. under the new standard, all leases, including operating leases, will require recognition of the lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees on the balance sheet. however, the effect on the statement of operations and the statement of cash flows largely is unchanged. the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, with early application permitted. the standard requires a modified retrospective approach, with restatement of the periods presented in the year of adoption. the primary impact of the new standard will be to the treatment of our 26 ground leases, which represent approximately 85% of all of our operating lease payments. while we have not completed our analysis, we believe that the application of this standard will result in the recording of a right of use asset and the related lease liability of between $400 million and $500 million for the ground leases, although changes in discount rates, ground lease terms or other variables may have a significant effect on this calculation. as noted above, we expect that the adoption of this standard will have minimal impact on our income statement.
in march 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting, which is intended to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions and will affect the classification of certain share-based awards and related income tax withholdings. the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. as a result of the standard, we anticipate that the majority of our share-based payment awards granted in 2017 will be deemed equity-classified awards, and the excess tax benefits or deficiencies that are incurred based on the difference between the intrinsic value of the award and the grant-date fair value will be recognized as income tax expense or benefit on the income statement. however, we do not anticipate that the implementation of this standard will have a material effect on our financial statements.
in november 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-18, statement of cash flows (topic 230): restricted cash, which requires that, on the statement of cash flows, amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and ending total amounts thereof. upon adoption of this standard, amounts included in restricted cash and furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement fund on our consolidated balance sheet will be included with cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. these amounts totaled $175 million and $156 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the adoption of this standard will not change our balance sheet presentation. the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. we plan to adopt this standard beginning january 1, 2017.
in january 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-01, business combinations (topic 805): clarifying the definition of a business. the standard adopts a two-step approach, wherein, if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single (group of similar) identifiable asset(s), then the transaction would be considered an asset purchase. as a result of the standard, we anticipate that the majority of our hotel purchases will be considered asset purchases as opposed to business combinations, although the determination will be made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. this standard will be applied on a prospective basis and, therefore, it does not affect the accounting for any of our previous transactions. the standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
our customers our customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business. similar to the majority of the lodging industry, we further categorize business within these broad groups based on characteristics they have in common as follows:
transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers. business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels. therefore, we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than trends in leisure demand. the four key subcategories of the transient business group are:
•   retail: this is the benchmark rate that a hotel publishes and offers to the general public. it typically is the rate charged to travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discounted rates. it includes the "rack rate," which typically is applied to rooms during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available. retail room rates will fluctuate more freely depending on anticipated demand levels (e.g. seasonality and weekday vs. weekend stays).

72
•   non-qualified discount: these include special rates offered by the hotels, including packages, advance-purchase discounts and promotional offers. these also include rooms booked through online travel agencies (otas).

•   special corporate: this is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally. these rates typically are negotiated annually at a discount to the anticipated retail rate. in addition, this category includes rates offered at the prevailing per diem for approved government travel.

•   qualified discount: this category encompasses all discount programs, such as aaa and aarp discounts, rooms booked through wholesale channels, frequent guest program redemptions, and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel.

group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together, usually with a minimum of 10 rooms. the three key sub-categories of the group business category are:
•   association: group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions.

•   corporate: group business related to corporate meetings (e.g., product launches, training programs, contract negotiations, and presentations).

•   other: group business predominately related to social, military, education, religious, fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams, otherwise known as smerf business.

contract business refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates. airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our airport hotels. additionally, contract rates may be utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand.
comparable hotel operating statistics to facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations, we present certain operating statistics (i.e., revpar, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses, hotel ebitda and associated margins) for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance.
because these statistics and operating results relate only to our hotel properties, they exclude results for our non-hotel properties and other real estate investments. we define our comparable hotels as properties:
(i)   that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results, whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations, for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared; and

(ii)   that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, or undergone large-scale capital projects (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

the hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. generally, hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. a large scale capital project that would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set is an extensive renovation of several core aspects of the hotel, such as rooms, meeting space, lobby, bars, restaurants and other public spaces. both quantitative and qualitative factors are taken into consideration in determining if the renovation would cause a hotel to be removed from the comparable hotel set, including unusual or exceptional circumstances such as: a reduction or increase in room count, rebranding, a significant alteration of the business operations, or the closing of the hotel during the renovation.
we do not include an acquired hotel in our comparable hotel set until the operating results for that hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year. for example, we acquired the don cesar in february 2017. the hotel will not be included in our comparable hotel set until january 1, 2019. hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed. similarly, hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption or commence a large-scale capital project. in each case, these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after completion of the repair of the property damage or cessation of the business interruption, or the completion of large-scale capital projects, as applicable.
of the 96 hotels that we owned on december 31, 2016, 88 have been classified as comparable hotels. the operating results of the following hotels that we owned as of december 31, 2016 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:
•   the denver marriott tech center, removed in the first quarter of 2016 (business disruption due to extensive renovations, including conversion of 64 rooms to 41 suites, conversion of the concierge lounge into three meeting rooms, and the repositioning of the public space and food and beverage areas);

73
•   the hyatt regency san francisco airport, removed in the first quarter of 2016 (business disruption due to extensive renovations, including all guestrooms and bathrooms, meeting space, the repositioning of the atrium into a new restaurant and lounge, and conversion of the existing restaurant to additional meeting space);

•   the camby hotel (previously the ritz-carlton, phoenix), removed in the third quarter of 2015 (business interruption due to rebranding, including closure of the hotel in july 2015 for extensive renovation work);

•   the phoenician (acquired in june 2015 and, beginning in second quarter 2016, business disruption due to extensive renovations, including all guestrooms and suites, a redesign of the lobby and public areas, renovation of pools, recreation areas and a restaurant and a re-configured spa and fitness center); and

•   axiom hotel (acquired as the powell hotel in january 2014, then closed during 2015 for extensive renovations and reopened in january 2016).

the operating results of 18 hotels disposed of in 2016 and 2015 are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein. in 2017, the following hotels will be excluded from our comparable hotel results because they have undergone large-scale capital projects during the comparable periods reported: the denver marriott tech center; the hyatt regency san francisco airport; marriott marquis san diego marina; the phoenician; and axiom hotel. we also will exclude the jw marriott desert springs resort & spa, which we sold in january, and the don cesar, which we acquired in february, along with any hotels acquired or sold during 2017.
as of december 31, 2015, 95 of our 106 hotels were classified as comparable. the operating results of the following hotels that we owned as of december 31, 2015 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:
•   novotel rio de janeiro parque olimpico and ibis rio de janeiro parque olimpico (opened in the fourth quarter of 2014);

•   the logan (previously the four seasons philadelphia), removed in the first quarter of 2015 (business interruption due to rebranding, including closure of the hotel in order to expedite renovation efforts);

•   houston airport marriott at george bush intercontinental, removed in the first quarter of 2015 (business interruption due to complete repositioning of the hotel, including guest room renovations and the closure of two restaurants to create a new food and beverage outlet and lobby experience); and

•   marriott marquis san diego marina, removed in the first quarter of 2015 (business interruption due to the demolition of the existing conference center and new exhibit hall).

constant us$, nominal us$, and constant euros operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction, or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. for comparative purposes, we also present the revpar results for 2015 assuming the results of our foreign operations were translated using the same exchange rates that were effective for the comparable periods in 2016, thereby eliminating the effect of currency fluctuation for the year-over-year comparisons. we believe this presentation is useful to investors as it provides clarity with respect to the growth in revpar in the local currency of the hotel consistent with the manner in which we would evaluate our domestic portfolio. however, the effect of changes in foreign currency has been reflected in the actual results of net income, ebitda, earnings per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share. nominal us$ results include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.
we also present revpar results for our joint venture in europe in constant euros using the same methodology as used for the constant us$ presentation.
non-gaap financial measures we use certain "non-gaap financial measures," which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, within the meaning of applicable sec rules. these measures are as follows: (i) ebitda and adjusted ebitda, as a measure of performance for host inc. and host l.p., (ii) funds from operations ("ffo") and ffo per diluted share (both nareit and adjusted), as a measure of performance for host inc., and (iii) comparable hotel property level operating results, as a measure of performance for host inc. and host l.p.
75
we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share in accordance with standards established by nareit, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the nareit definition of ffo or do not calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance. in addition, although ffo per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other reits, it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-reits. we also calculate adjusted ffo per diluted share, which measure is not in accordance with nareit guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other reits. ebitda and adjusted ebitda, as presented, also may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies. this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with gaap. cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense (for ebitda and adjusted ebitda purposes only) and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the ebitda, adjusted ebitda, nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share presentations. management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-gaap financial measures. additionally, nareit ffo per diluted share, adjusted ffo per diluted share, ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. in addition, nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share do not measure, and should not be used as a measure of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders' benefit.
similarly, adjusted ebitda, nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. our equity investments primarily consist of our approximate one-third interest in a european joint venture, a 25% interest in an asian joint venture, a 67% ownership in a joint venture that owns a vacation ownership property in hawaii and interests ranging from 11% to 50% in three partnerships that each own one hotel. due to the voting rights of the outside owners, we do not control and, therefore, do not consolidate these entities. the non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in host lp held by outside partners and interests ranging from 15% to 48% held by outside partners in three partnerships each owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and, therefore, consolidate its operations. these pro rata results for adjusted ebitda were calculated as set forth in the definition below under "equity investment adjustments" and "consolidated partnership adjustments." similar adjustments were made in the calculation of both nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share. readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated and non-consolidated partnerships may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities. the following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance.
ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. management believes ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). management also believes the use of ebitda facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits, hotel owners that are not reits and other capital-intensive companies. management uses ebitda to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs.
adjusted ebitda historically, management has adjusted ebitda when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of adjusted ebitda, when combined with the primary gaap presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. adjusted ebitda also is a relevant measure in calculating certain credit ratios. we adjust ebitda for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as adjusted ebitda:
•   real estate transactions - we exclude the effect of gains and losses, including the amortization of deferred gains, recorded on the disposition or acquisition of depreciable assets and property insurance gains in our consolidated statement of operations because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. in addition, material gains or losses from the depreciated book value of the disposed assets could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value often does not reflect its market value (as noted below for ffo).

76
•   equity investment adjustments - we exclude the equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated investments in partnerships and joint ventures as presented in our consolidated statement of operations because it includes our pro rata portion of depreciation, amortization and interest expense, which are excluded from ebitda. we include our pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our equity investments as we believe this more accurately reflects the performance of our investments. the pro rata adjusted ebitda of equity investments is defined as the ebitda of our equity investments adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by our percentage ownership in the partnership or joint venture.

•   consolidated partnership adjustments - we deduct the non-controlling partners' pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our consolidated partnerships as this reflects the non-controlling owners' interest in the ebitda of our consolidated partnerships. the pro rata adjusted ebitda of non-controlling partners is defined as the ebitda of our consolidated partnerships adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by the non-controlling partners' positions in the partnership or joint venture.

•   cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle - infrequently, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. we exclude these one-time adjustments because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period.

•   impairment losses - we exclude the effect of impairment expense recorded because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets. in addition, we believe that impairment expense, which is based on historical cost book values, is similar to gains (losses) on dispositions and depreciation expense, both of which also are excluded from ebitda.

•   acquisition costs - under gaap, costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred. we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company.

•   litigation gains and losses - effective april 1, 2013, we have excluded the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business, which is consistent with the definition of adjusted ffo that we adopted effective january 1, 2011. we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

in unusual circumstances, we also may adjust ebitda for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance. for example, in 2013, management excluded the $11 million gain from the eminent domain claim for land for which we received the cash proceeds in 2007, but, pending the resolution of certain contingencies, was not recognized until 2013. typically, gains from the disposition of non-depreciable property are included in the determination of adjusted ebitda.

(1)   net income, ebitda, adjusted ebitda, nareit ffo and adjusted ffo include a gain of $2 million for each of the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for the sale of the portion of land attributable to individual units sold by the maui timeshare joint venture. additionally, in 2016, these line items include $12 million for the reimbursement of operating losses at the new orleans marriott due to the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill.

(2)   reflects the sale of ten hotels in 2016 and the sale of eight hotels in 2015.

nareit ffo, nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share. we present nareit ffo and nareit ffo per diluted share as non-gaap measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with gaap). we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share as our nareit ffo (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with nareit guidelines. nareit defines ffo as net income (calculated in accordance with gaap), excluding gains (losses) from sales of real estate, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, real estate-related depreciation, amortization and impairments and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the ffo of those entities on the same basis.
we believe that nareit ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of nareit ffo per diluted share, when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization, impairments and gains and losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other reits, even though nareit ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. as noted by nareit in its april 2002 "white paper on funds from operations," since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. for these reasons, nareit adopted the ffo metric in order to promote an industry-wide measure of reit operating performance.
we also present adjusted ffo per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. we believe that the presentation of adjusted ffo per diluted share, when combined with both the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share and ffo per diluted share as defined by nareit, provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. we adjust nareit ffo per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as adjusted ffo per diluted share:
•   gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt - we exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of the write off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. we also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. we believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

•   acquisition costs -under gaap, costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred. we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company.

•   litigation gains and losses - we exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

in unusual circumstances, we also may adjust nareit ffo for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance. for example, in 2013, management excluded the $11 million gain from the eminent domain claim for land for which we received the cash proceeds in 2007, but, pending the resolution of certain contingencies, was not recognized until 2013. typically, gains from the disposition of non-depreciable property are included in the determination of nareit and adjusted ffo.

comparable hotel property level operating results. we present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, ebitda and ebitda margin, on a comparable hotel, or "same store," basis as supplemental information for investors. our comparable hotel results present operating results for hotels owned during the entirety of the periods being compared without giving effect to any acquisitions or dispositions, significant property damage or large scale capital improvements during these periods. we present comparable hotel ebitda to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable properties after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense), and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). other corporate-level costs and expenses are also removed to arrive at property-level results. we believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information into the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. we eliminate depreciation and amortization because, even though depreciation and amortization are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. as noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.
as a result of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization, the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.
we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners. in particular, these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors, such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions. while management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a "same store" supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of these hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results. for these reasons, we believe that comparable hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of gaap operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management.

item 1a. risk factors risks related to our business product marketplace and operational risks:
the insurance industry is a regulated industry, populated by many public and private companies. we operate in the life and health insurance sectors of the insurance industry, each with its own set of risks.
the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits. as our insurance sales are primarily made to individuals, rather than groups, and the face amounts of life policies sold are lower than those of policies sold in the higher income market, the development and maintenance of direct-to-consumer systems and development and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents to support sales growth in this market are critical. adequate compensation that is competitive with other career opportunities and that also motivates producing agents to increase sales is critical. in globe life direct response, continuous development of new methods of reaching the consumer and cost efficiency are key. less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits.
economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. we serve primarily the middle-income market for individual protection life and health insurance and, as a result, we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer's disposable income. if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited, as a result of a significant, sustained economic downturn or otherwise, then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging, and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. economic conditions could also impact our investment portfolio as discussed under investment risks below.
variations in expected to actual rates of mortality, morbidity, and persistency could materially negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. we establish a liability for our policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims. these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain. the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality, morbidity, and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments. even though our actuaries continually test expected-to-actual results, actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set. accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments. significant adverse variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could require policy obligations to be increased and negatively affect our profit margins and income.
a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer's ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations. these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products. a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways, including the following: limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our independent agencies.
rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us. credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer's ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity. actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings, or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could potentially have a negative effect on our operations, by limiting our access to capital markets, increasing the cost of debt, or impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations, thereby potentially limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries or making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries.
ratings reflect only the rating agency's views and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company's control. in addition, rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated
6
index to financial statements company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered the models. changes to the models could impact the rating agencies' judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company. there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if in each rating agency's judgment, circumstances so warrant. we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
life insurance marketplace risk:
our life products are sold in selected niche markets. we are at risk should any of these markets diminish. we have several life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches, two of which are labor union members and sales via globe life direct response solicitation. deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public's receptivity to direct response marketing initiatives could negatively affect this business.
health insurance marketplace risks:
the health insurance market is subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny. regulatory changes could impact our medicare supplement and other supplemental health businesses. the nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business.
competition in the health insurance market can be significant. sales of our health insurance products are subject to competition from other health insurance companies and alternative healthcare providers, such as those that provide alternatives to traditional medicare to seniors. in addition, some insurers may be willing to significantly reduce their profit margins or underprice new sales in order to gain market share. we choose not to compete for market share based on these terms. accordingly, changes in the competitive landscape, including the pricing strategies employed by our competitors, could negatively impact the future sales of our health insurance products.
obtaining timely and appropriate premium rate increases for certain health insurance policies is critical. a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance. medicare supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level. as a result, it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success. because medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program, which experiences health care inflation every year, annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are necessary. obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market. accordingly, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability and thus our results of operations and financial condition.
information security and technology risks:
the failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems at the company could compromise secure data thereby adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.
our business operations are highly dependent upon information technology systems to provide efficient and resilient business operations. malicious actors, employee errors or disasters affecting these information systems could impair our business operations, regulatory compliance and financial condition. to the extent our information systems may be breached by malicious actors, employee malfeasance or technological attacks, an attacker could circumvent security measures in order to alter or delete customer or proprietary information from our systems. in addition, we may not become aware of sophisticated or advanced cyber attacks for some time after they occur, thereby increasing the company's exposure.
employee errors in the handling of our information or technology systems may inadvertently result in unauthorized access to customer or proprietary information, or an inability to use our information technology systems to efficiently support business operations.
in addition, an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access, use or disclosure of their confidential information. any such breach of confidential information could damage our reputation in the
7
index to financial statements marketplace, deter potential customers from purchasing our products, result in the loss of existing customers, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability, or require us to incur significant technical, legal or other expenses.
in the event of a disaster, such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, or a terrorist attack or war, our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees or customers for a period of time. a disaster or natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, terror attack or war may make our information systems unavailable to support business operations for a period of time, affecting our systems, physical business operations, and financial condition. even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed and if existing contingency plans cannot function as designed.
reputational risk:
damage to the reputation of torchmark or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business. negative publicity through traditional media, internet, social media, and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts, the ability to market our products, and the persistency of our block of inforce policies. as discussed above in information security and technology risks, the company could be subjected to adverse publicity as a result of a significant security breach.
investment risks:
our investments are subject to market and credit risks. significant downgrades, delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio could potentially result in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses. our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults, downgrades and changes in market values. our investment portfolio consists, almost exclusively, of fixed maturity and short-term investments. a significant portion of our fixed maturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds, exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment. factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels, financial market performance, disruptions in credit markets, general economic conditions, legislative changes, particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer and other factors beyond our control.
additionally, as the majority of our investments are longer-term fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity, significant increases in interest rates, widening of credit spreads or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio, even with regard to performing assets. these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. significant unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders' equity. it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable. in that case, the unrealized loss will be realized, at which point we would take an impairment charge, reducing our net income.
we cannot be assured that any particular issuer, regardless of industry, will be able to make required interest and principal payments, on a timely basis or at all. significant downgrades of issuers could negatively impact our risk-based capital ratios, leading to potential downgrades by our rating agencies, potential reduction in future dividend capacity, and/or higher financing costs at the holding company should additional statutory capital be required.
changes in interest rates could negatively affect income. declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk that they will fail to earn the level of interest on investments assumed in pricing products and in setting discount rates used to calculate the net policy liabilities. while we attempt to manage our investments to earn an excess investment income spread, we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads. significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. these calls could result in a decline in our investment income, as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates.
increases in interest rates could cause the fair value of securities within our bond portfolio to decline. a rise in interest rates could also result in certain policyholders surrendering their annuity policies for cash thereby potentially requiring our insurance subsidiaries to liquidate bonds if other sources of liquidity are not available to meet their obligations. in such a case, realized losses could result from such sales and could adversely affect our statutory income and results of operations.
8
index to financial statements liquidity risks:
our ability to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available, primarily dividends, from our insurance subsidiaries. as a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries, which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock. moreover, our liquidity, including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us, as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock, depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. other sources of liquidity include a variety of short-term and long-term instruments, including our credit facility, commercial paper, long-term debt, intercompany financing, and reinsurance.
the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries' liquidity are insurance premiums, as well as investment income, maturities, repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. for example, in the states where our companies are domiciled, an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are restricted based on regulations by their state of domicile. accordingly, impairments in invested assets or a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries' operations that reduces their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow payment of dividends to us, a principal source of our cash flow.
we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which could, under certain circumstances, significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries. although we do not anticipate changes, changes in these laws could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. additionally, if our insurance subsidiaries were unable to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities, their profitability, and their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us could be negatively impacted. limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock.
adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital, as well as affect our cost of capital. should treasury rates increase or credit spreads widen in the future, the interest rate on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase, and our net income could be reduced. in addition, if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption, uncertainty, and instability, these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital. such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities (in a timely manner or at all) and/or access the capital necessary to grow our business.
in the unlikely event that current sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital. the availability and cost of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit or capital, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity. additionally, customers, lenders, or investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we were to incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. if our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. as such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than we prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. as a result, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially negatively affected.
9
index to financial statements regulatory risks:
our businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth. insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which they do business. the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders, not our investors. state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business, including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries, marketing practices, advertising, licensing of agents, policy forms, capital adequacy, solvency, reserves, and permitted investments. also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals. the insurance laws, regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time, possibly having an adverse effect on our business. should these changes to our business occur, we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority's interpretation of such laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities and/or impose substantial fines.
we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives. in recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, by insurance regulatory authorities, which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents. these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. such actions could result in substantial fines, penalties, or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. additionally, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may, even absent any particular regulatory authority's interpretation of an issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow, impact regulatory capital requirements, or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business.
currently, the u.s. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. however, the dodd-frank wall street record and consumer protection act of 2010 established a federal insurance office (fio) within the department of the treasury, and the affordable care act and a financial stability oversight council (fsoc) created the center for consumer information and insurance oversight (cciio), originally established under the department of health and human services and subsequently transferred to the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms). the creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the direct oversight or regulation of the insurance industry. we cannot predict what impact, if any, the fio, fsoc and cciio, as well as any other proposals for federal oversight or regulation of insurance could have on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
changes in u.s. federal income tax law could increase our tax costs. changes to the internal revenue code, administrative rulings, or court decisions affecting the insurance industry, including the products it offers, could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income, or negatively affect our ability to sell some of our products.
changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standard-setting bodies may affect our financial statements, reduce our reported profitability, and change the timing of profit recognition. our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap and accounting practices as promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners' statutory accounting practices (naic sap), which principles are periodically revised and/or expanded. accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies. it is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. further, standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time, many of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability.
10
index to financial statements non-compliance with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality, could materially adversely affect our reputation and business operations. the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal gramm-leach-bliley act of 1999 (glba) and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa). hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations). noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, whether by us or by one of our business associates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties, various forms of damages, consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices, adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief.
litigation risk:
litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries. we are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants, and, in certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. however, the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers' sales practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise agents, and other matters. these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive damages. in some states in which we operate, juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit.
our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases, the costs of settlement or judgments against us, or changes in our operations that could result from litigation. substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation, which, in turn, could materially harm our business and our business prospects.
catastrophic event risk:
our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events. our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively low-face amounts. accordingly, it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster. however, our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or morbidity, caused by events such as a pandemic, hurricane, earthquake, or man-made catastrophes, including acts of terrorism or war, which may produce significant claims in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.
results of operations how torchmark views its operations: torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life, and supplemental health insurance to middle income households throughout the united states. we view our operations by segments, which are the insurance product lines of life, health, and annuities, and the investment segment that supports the product lines. segments are aligned based on their common characteristics, comparability of the profit margins, and management techniques used to operate each segment.
insurance product line segments. as fully explained in note 14-business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the insurance product line segments involve the marketing, underwriting, and the administration of policies. each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies. each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market. whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole, or the individual distribution units within the segment, the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin, which is:
premium revenue less:
policy obligations policy acquisition costs and commissions investment segment. the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources, including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity. our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income, which is:
net investment income less:

torchmark's operations on a segment-by-segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report.
summary of operations: as shown in the above chart, net income was $550 million in 2016, compared with $527 million in 2015. net income decreased in 2015 from $543 million in 2014. on a diluted per share basis, 2016 net income rose 8% to $4.49 after a 2% increase in 2015. net income per diluted share in 2015 rose to $4.16 from $4.09 in 2014. the per share results have exceeded the growth in dollar amounts due to our share repurchase program. each year's per share net income was affected by realized investment gains (losses), which were $(0.06), $(0.05), and $0.12, in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. more information concerning realized investment gains and losses can be found under the caption realized gains and losses in this report.
net operating income from continuing operations rose each year over the prior year from $520 million in 2014 to $523 million in 2015 to $549 million in 2016. also, as explained in note 14-business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments. additionally, net income was affected by certain significant and unusual non-operating items in each of the years 2014 through 2016. we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations. accordingly, as described in note 14-business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, we remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are non-operating items when evaluating the results of current operations, and therefore exclude such matters from our segment analysis for current periods.
effective july 1, 2016, torchmark sold its medicare part d prescription drug plan business to an unaffiliated third party. torchmark decided to exit its medicare part d business due to declining margins, increased risks, higher drug costs, and increased administrative and compliance costs. this sale allows the company to better focus on its core protection life and health insurance businesses and provides additional capital to invest. the financial results of this business are

the life insurance segment is our strongest segment and is the largest contributor to earnings in each year presented. this segment contributed $4 million in 2016 and $13 million in 2015 to the growth in our underwriting margin. also contributing to growth in income in both years was our health insurance segment, which provided $6 million of additional margin in 2016 and $5 million in 2015.
excess investment income, the measure of profitability of our investment segment, increased to $224 million or 2% from the prior year amount of $220 million. in 2015, excess investment income decreased 2%. investment yields continue to be pressured by reinvesting proceeds from dispositions at lower rates relative to the fixed maturity assets being disposed of and spreads related to required interest on net policy liabilities throughout the three-year period. excess investment income has also been hampered by a lag in government reimbursements of medicare part d costs. the impact of the lost investment income from delayed receipt of reimbursements is reflected in income from continuing operations rather than discontinued operations in accordance with applicable accounting rules. as noted previously, the medicare part d business has been classified as discontinued operations.
total revenues rose 4% in 2016 to $3.9 billion, or $169 million over the prior year total of $3.8 billion. life premium rose 6% or $116 million in 2016 to $2.2 billion. life premium increased $107 million in 2015 to $2.1 billion. net investment income rose $16 million or 2% in 2015, and rose 4% or $33 million in 2016. health premium increased 2% to $948 million in 2016 and contributed $22 million to 2016 revenue growth, after having gained 6% to $926 million in 2015. health premium contributed $56 million to 2015 revenue growth.
life insurance premium and underwriting margins have grown steadily in each of the last three years ended december 31, 2016. the increase in life premium was driven by sales growth and improvements in persistency. while premium and underwriting margins grew, margin as a percent of premium declined in 2016 to 26%, after decreasing from 28% to 27% from 2014 to 2015. these declines were due primarily to higher than expected globe life direct response policy obligations. net life sales were flat in 2016 at $412 million after increasing 9% in 2015. the life insurance segment is discussed further in this report under the caption life insurance.
health insurance premium income increased 2% to $948 million in 2016. health net sales fell 7% to $145 million during 2016, as a result of a 20% decrease in medicare supplement sales. the decrease in 2016 medicare supplement net sales was expected due to group sales returning to a more normal level after unusually high sales in 2014. group sales vary significantly from period to period due to the impact of large groups that are sold from time to time. first-year collected health premium fell 11% to $140 million from the prior year total of $157 million as a result of a high level of group sales in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 that positively affected the 2015 first-year collected premium. health margins were flat at 22%, with underwriting income increasing to $210 million for 2016 due to the growth in premium income. underwriting income was $204 million for the same period in 2015 compared with $199 million in 2014.
we do not currently market annuities. see the caption annuities for discussion of the annuity segment.
the investment segment's pretax profitability, or excess investment income, is based on three major components: net investment income, required interest on net policy liabilities (interest applicable to insurance products), and financing costs. in 2016, net investment income rose 4%, compared with 2% in 2015. at the same time, our investment portfolio grew 6% in 2016 and 3%, on an amortized cost basis, in 2015. in recent years, net investment income has not grown as fast as the portfolio due primarily to new investments being made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed. the growth rate of net investment income is sometimes impacted by a lag between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested, during which the funds are held in cash. in addition, torchmark's share repurchase program (described later under this caption) has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments and increase net investment income. net investment income was negatively impacted during 2014 through 2016 by our medicare part d business. under the program, we were required to cover certain costs in the current period that are the federal government's responsibility, but are not reimbursed until late in the next calendar year. this delay in reimbursement reduced our funds available for investment in each year, resulting in reduced investment income.
the interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income, and generally grows in conjunction with the net policy liabilities that are supported by the invested assets. the lower new-money yields resulting from the
18
index to financial statements low interest rate environment noted above have compressed excess investment income as required interest has continued to grow at approximately the same rate that net policy liabilities have grown. financing costs, which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and short-term debt, are also deducted from net investment income. financing costs in 2016 increased 9% to $83 million from $77 million in 2015. the additional interest expense resulted primarily from the issuance of our new 6.125% junior subordinated debt security seventy days before the maturity and repayment of our 6.375% senior notes.
torchmark's current investment policy regarding fixed maturities limits new fixed maturity acquisitions to investment-grade securities generally with longer maturities (often exceeding twenty years) that meet our quality and yield objectives. approximately 96% of our invested assets at fair value are fixed maturities, of which 95% were investment grade at december 31, 2016. the average quality rating of the portfolio was bbb+. the portfolio contains no securities backed by subprime or alt-a mortgages, no direct investment in residential mortgages, no credit default swaps, or other derivative contracts. see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments in this report and note 4-investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of this segment.
insurance administrative expenses were up 5.6% in 2016 when compared with the prior year period, and increased to 6.3% as a percentage of premium from 6.2% in 2015 and 2014. the increase in administrative expenses is primarily due to investments in information technology that will enhance our customer experience, improve our data analytic capabilities, improve our ability to adapt to future changes and bolster our information security programs. stock compensation expense declined $2 million in 2016 to $26.3 million compared with a decrease of $4 million in 2015 to $28.7 million. the decline in stock compensation expense in 2016 and 2015 resulted primarily from lower expense associated with performance shares as well as lower option values on 2016 and 2015 option awards.
share purchases torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986. with no specified authorization amount, we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the excess cash flow at the parent company, general market conditions, and other alternative uses. the majority of these purchases are made from excess cash flow. excess cash flow at the parent company is primarily comprised of dividends received from the insurance subsidiaries less interest expense paid on its debt, dividends paid to torchmark shareholders, and other limited operating activities. additionally, when stock options are exercised, proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises. the board of directors has authorized the company's share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management, in consultation with the board, determines to be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the last three years.

a discussion of each of torchmark's segments follows. the following discussions are presented in the manner we view our operations, as described in note 14-business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
19
index to financial statements life insurance life insurance is our largest insurance segment, with 2016 life premium representing 70% of total premium. life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 72% of the total in 2016. additionally, investments supporting the reserves for life products produce the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment.
we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term: "annualized premium in force," "net sales," and "first-year collected premium." annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve-month period. annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue. net sales is annualized premium issued, net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue, except in the case of globe life direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired. we believe that net sales is a better indicator of the rate of premium growth as compared to annualized premium issued. first-year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year. first-year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur, and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future.
life insurance premium rose 6% to $2.2 billion in 2016 after having increased 5% in 2015 to $2.1 billion. life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels. premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows:

the american income exclusive agency has historically marketed primarily to members of labor unions. while labor unions are still the core market for this agency, american income has diversified in recent years by focusing heavily on other affinity groups and referrals to help ensure sustainable growth. this agency is torchmark's largest contributor to life premium of any distribution channel at 42% of torchmark's 2016 total. this group produced premium income of $913 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year total of $831 million, after having risen 8% in 2015. first-year collected premium was $174 million compared to $156 million in 2015, an increase of 11%. first-year collected premium rose 16% in 2015. net sales increased 6% to $210 million in 2016 over the 2015 total of $198 million. net sales increased 15% in 2015 over the 2014 total of $172 million. sales growth in our captive agencies is generally dependent on growth in the size of the agency force. the american income agency's average agent count rose 2% to 6,671 for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared with 6,529 for the same period in 2015. the average producing agent count is based on the actual count at the end of each week during the period. the american income exclusive agency has been focusing on growing and strengthening middle management to support sustainable growth of the agency force. to accomplish this, the agency has placed an increased emphasis on agent training programs and financial incentives that appropriately reward agents at all levels for helping develop and train its agents, including more home-office and webinar training programs. these programs are designed to provide each agent, from new recruits to top level managers, coaching and instruction specifically designed for their level of experience and responsibility. we are also making considerable investments in information technology in support of the agency, including the launching of a lead mapping and management tool to the agency force in 2017. we anticipate this tool will enhance overall productivity of agents and improve agent retention.
the globe life direct response unit offers adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of direct-to-consumer marketing approaches, which include direct mailings, insert media, and electronic media. these different approaches support and complement one another in the unit's efforts to reach the consumer. the globe life direct response channel's growth has been fueled by constant innovation. in recent years, electronic media production has grown rapidly as management has aggressively increased marketing activities related to internet and mobile technology, and has focused on driving traffic to the inbound call center. we continually introduce new initiatives in this unit in an attempt to increase response rates.
while the juvenile market is an important source of sales, it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders, who are more likely to respond favorably to a globe life direct response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population. also, both juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition-cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time.
globe life direct response's life premium income rose 5% to $783 million, representing 36% of torchmark's total life premium during 2016. life premium in this channel increased 6% in 2015 to $747 million over the 2014 total of $702 million. net sales of $150 million for this group decreased 9% from $164 million in 2015, after a 4% increase in 2015. the sales decline was expected as we have shifted our marketing efforts away from certain segments that no longer meet our profit objectives. first-year collected premium decreased 7% to $98 million in 2016 after having risen 6% in 2015.

life insurance underwriting income before insurance administrative expense was $574 million in 2016 compared with $569 million in 2015 and $556 million in 2014. as a percentage of premium, underwriting margins declined to 26% in 2016 from 27% in 2015. the decrease in underwriting margin as a percentage of premium in 2016 and 2015 was due to higher globe life direct response net policy obligations. the higher than anticipated net policy obligations in the globe life direct response unit primarily relate to policies issued in calendar years 2011 through 2015. the increase is primarily attributed to a spike in claims in certain blocks of policies as well as policies where additional prescription drug information was used in the underwriting process with an expectation of improved mortality. to date, improvements in actual mortality have been less than expected, causing higher than expected net policy obligations.

index to financial statements health insurance health insurance sold by torchmark includes primarily medicare supplement insurance, critical illness coverage, accident coverage, and other limited-benefit supplemental health products. in this analysis, all health coverage plans other than medicare supplement are classified as limited-benefit plans.
health premium accounted for 30% of our total premium in 2016, while the health underwriting margin accounted for 26% of total underwriting margin, reflective of the lower underwriting margin as a percent of premium for health compared with life insurance. as noted under the caption life insurance, we have emphasized life insurance sales relative to health, due to life's superior profitability and its greater contribution to excess investment income.

health premium increased 2% to $948 million in 2016 compared with $926 million in 2015 after an increase of 6% in 2015 over the 2014 total of $869 million. medicare supplement premium increased 1% to $472 million in 2016 compared with $466 million in 2015. medicare supplement premium totaled $423 million in 2014. other limited-benefit health premium increased 4% to $475 million over the prior year total of $459 million. other limited-benefit premium totaled $446 million in 2014.
health net sales declined 7% to $145 million in 2016 from $156 million in 2015. health net sales in 2014 totaled $181 million. medicare supplement net sales decreased 20% to $61 million in 2016, after declining 29% to $76 million in 2015. limited-benefit net sales increased 4% to $84 million in 2016 compared with an increase of 8% in 2015 to $81 million.
health first-year collected premium fell 11% to $140 million. health first-year collected premium rose 32% during 2015. first year medicare supplement premium was down 23% in 2016 to $69 million from the prior year total of $91 million compared with an increase of $32 million or 53% in 2015 over 2014 total of $59 million. first year limited-benefit premium increased 7% to $71 million in 2016 compared with an increase of 11% in 2015 over the 2014 total of $60 million.
25
index to financial statements the decline in medicare supplement net sales and first-year premium was primarily due to group sales returning to a normal level after unusually high sales in late 2014 that positively affected the 2015 first-year collected premium.  group sales vary significantly from period to period due to the impact of large groups that are sold from time to time which in turn impact premium income. first year limited-benefit premium increased 7% to $71 million in 2016 compared with an increase of 11% in 2015 over the 2014 total of $60 million.
health care reform activity is not expected to have a significant impact on our operations, and we are continuing to monitor future developments. the affordable care act (aca) imposes an annual fee to health insurance issuers offering commercial health insurance as well as another fee for premium stabilization. these taxes totaled $621 thousand, $1.2 million and $1.8 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the ua independent agency consists of independent agencies appointed with torchmark who may also sell for other companies. the ua independent agency was torchmark's largest health agency in terms of health premium income. in 2016, premium income was $355 million, representing 38% of torchmark's total health premium. net sales were $56 million, or 39% of torchmark's health sales. this agency is also torchmark's largest producer of medicare supplement insurance, with medicare supplement premium income of $342 million. the ua independent agency represents 72% of all torchmark medicare supplement premium and 91% of medicare supplement net sales. medicare supplement premium in this agency rose 4% in 2016. total health premium increased 3% in 2016 and 13% in 2015. medicare supplement net sales decreased 22% in 2016 from the prior year, primarily due to a decline in group sales. as noted earlier, group medicare supplement sales have historically fluctuated from period to period.
the family heritage exclusive agency primarily markets limited-benefit supplemental health insurance in non-urban areas. most of their policies include a cash-back feature, such as a return of premium whereby any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy. management expects to grow this agency through geographic expansion and continuing incorporation of torchmark's recruiting programs. the family heritage agency contributed $51 million in net sales in 2016, compared with $50 million in 2015 and $47 million in 2014. health premium income was $236 million in 2016, representing 25% of torchmark's health premium. this compared with $221 million or 24% of health premium in 2015 and $205 million or 24% in 2014. the average producing agent count was 923 for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared with 882 for the same period in 2015, an increase of 5%.
the liberty national exclusive agency represented 21% of all torchmark health premium income at $202 million in 2016. the liberty agency markets limited-benefit supplemental health products consisting primarily of critical illness insurance. much of liberty's health business is now generated through work site marketing targeting small businesses of 10 to 25 employees. in 2016, health premium income in the agency declined 4% from prior year premium of $209 million after declining 6% during 2015. liberty's health premium decline has been due primarily to its declining medicare supplement block. liberty's first-year collected premium increased 8% to $16 million in 2016 compared with an increase of 11% to $15 million in 2015, reflecting the steady increase in net sales of limited-benefit plans in the agency.
other distribution. certain of our other distribution channels market health products, although their main emphasis is on life insurance. on a combined basis, they accounted for 16% of health premium in 2016 and 2015. the american income exclusive agency primarily markets accident plans. the direct response group markets primarily medicare supplements to employer or union-sponsored groups. direct response added $6 million of medicare supplement net sales in 2016 compared with $5 million in 2015 and $23 million in 2014. the higher net sales in 2014 were due to the addition of a large new group in the third quarter of 2014.
26
index to financial statements as presented in the following table, torchmark's health insurance underwriting income before other income and administrative expense increased 3% to $210 million in 2016, after an increase of 3% to $204 million in 2015. as a percentage of health premium, margins were flat at 22% in 2016 and were down slightly to 22% in 2015 from 23% in 2014.

annuities. our fixed annuity balances at the end of 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $1.24 billion, $1.32 billion, and $1.36 billion, respectively. underwriting income was $9.4 million, $4.6 million, and $4.3 million in each of the respective years.
while the fixed annuity account balance has been declining slightly year over year, underwriting income has increased each year over the prior year. the significant increase in underwriting income in 2016 was primarily due to a slowdown in amortization as assumptions were adjusted to reflect longer retention of the annuity block than previously estimated as a result of the continuing low interest rate environment. policy charges have actually declined slightly in each successive year. the majority of policy charges consist of surrender charges which are based on a function of account size and time lapsed since deposit. a considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements, which can result in negative net policy obligations. in the three-year period, however, spreads tended to level as crediting rates reached guaranteed minimums. we do not currently market annuity products, favoring instead protection-oriented life and health insurance products. therefore, we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward.

insurance administrative expenses were up 5.6% in 2016 when compared with the prior year after increasing 6.5% during 2015. as a percentage of total premium, insurance administrative expenses increased to 6.3% in 2016 from 6.2% in 2015 and 2014. total operating expenses increased 3.7% in 2016, after increasing 2.9% in 2015. the primary reason for the increase in administrative expenses are higher information technology costs. the decline in stock compensation expense is primarily due to lower expense associated with performance share awards and lower option values on the 2016 and 2015 grants.

index to financial statements investments. we manage our capital resources including investments, debt, and cash flow through the investment segment. excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations. it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 14-business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. it is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or "financing costs."
we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding, representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company. since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986, we have used $6.8 billion of excess cash flow at the parent company to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives. share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest-bearing assets, but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding. in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis, we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment.

excess investment income increased $5 million or 2% in 2016 over the prior year. excess investment income decreased $5 million or 2% in 2015. on a per diluted share basis, excess investment income increased 6% to $1.83 in 2016. excess investment income increased 2% to $1.73 per share in 2015, after having increased 8% in the prior year. the higher percentage increase in the excess investment income per diluted share amount over the percentage increase in the dollar amount of excess investment income for those same periods is a result of our share repurchase program.
presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income and the growth in mean invested assets.

index to financial statements the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income, which rose 4% to $807 million in 2016. it increased 2% to $774 million in 2015 from $758 million in 2014. in 2016, fixed maturity yields averaged 5.78% on a tax-equivalent and effective-yield basis, compared with 5.84% in 2015 and 5.91% in 2014.growth in net investment income has been slower than the growth in mean invested assets in recent years as a result of the decline in the average yields. the decrease in the overall portfolio yield from 2014 to 2016 was due primarily to reinvesting proceeds from calls and maturities at yield rates lower than the bonds earned before it was called or matured.
net investment income has also been negatively affected in the calendar years 2014 through 2016 by the cms requirement for us to pay certain medicare part d claims costs during the current period that are ultimately the responsibility of the government, but are not reimbursed until the following year. because of the overall design of the program and higher part d claims due to higher overall drug costs, we have incurred extensive upfront costs that are not reimbursed by cms until late in the following respective year. we also experience delays from the time certain claims are paid until related drug rebates are received from various pharmaceutical companies. these delays in reimbursements cause a lag in the timing of investable cash flows that result in lower investment income than would have been earned absent the delays. we estimate the delays resulted in a loss of approximately $5 million, $8 million and $9 million of pre-tax net investment income in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. as we have exited this business, the negative impact is expected to be approximately $2 million to $3 million in 2017 and negligible in 2018.
while net investment income in recent years has been negatively impacted by the factors discussed above, we would expect to see only modest declines in the average portfolio yield rate over the next few years. we anticipate that approximately 2% of fixed maturities on average are expected to run off each year over the next five years. accordingly, we believe it is unlikely that dispositions will have a significant negative impact on net investment income and the growth rate of net investment income in the next few years.
should interest rates rise, especially long-term rates, torchmark's net investment income would benefit due to higher interest rates on new purchases. we could withstand an increase in interest rates of approximately 60 to 65 basis points before the net unrealized gains on our fixed maturity portfolio as of december 31, 2016 would be eliminated (assuming there were no credit related valuation declines). should interest rates increase further than that, we would not be concerned with potential interest rate driven unrealized losses in our fixed maturity portfolio because we have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our fixed maturities to maturity.
required interest on net insurance policy liabilities reduces net investment income as it is the amount of net investment income considered by management necessary to "fund" the required interest included in the insurance segments. as such, it is removed from the investment segment and applied to the insurance segments to offset the effect of the required interest from the insurance segments. as discussed in note 14-business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, management believes this provides a more meaningful analysis of the investment and insurance segments. required interest is based on the actuarial interest assumptions used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force. the great majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interest-rate protection policies, not investment products, and are accounted for under current accounting guidance for long-duration insurance products which mandates that interest rate assumptions for a particular block of business be "locked in" for the life of that block of business. each calendar year, we set the discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year. that rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on cash flow received in the future from policies of that issue year, and cannot be changed. the discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in. as such, the overall discount rate for the entire in force block is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years. changes in the overall weighted-average discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves and the deferred acquisition cost asset by issue year on the entire block of in force business. business issued in the current year has very little impact on the overall weighted-average discount rate due to the size of our in force business.
because actuarial discount rates are locked in for life on essentially all of our business, benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs are not affected by interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition event occurs. due to the strength of our underwriting margins and the current positive spread between the yield on our investment portfolio and the weighted-average discount rate of our in force block, we don't expect an extended low-interest-rate environment to cause a loss recognition event.

excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs. financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income. the table below presents the components of financing costs and reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations.

financing costs increased $7 million or 9% from 2015 to 2016. the additional interest expense on our funded debt resulted from the issuance of our new 6.125% junior subordinated debt security seventy days before the maturity and repayment of our 6.375% senior notes. in 2016, interest on short-term debt increased because of the increase in the weighted-average interest rate. financing costs also increased slightly from 2014 to 2015. more information on our debt transactions are disclosed in the financial condition section of this report and in note 11-debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
as previously noted, growth rates in our excess investment income decline when growth in income from the portfolio is less than that of the interest required by policy liabilities and financing costs, as has been the case in recent years. in an extended low-interest-rate environment, the portfolio yield will tend to decline as we invest new money at lower long-term rates.
excess investment income benefits from increases in long-term rates available on new investments and decreases in short-term borrowing rates. of these two factors, higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount
31
index to financial statements of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at short-term rates. therefore, torchmark would benefit if rates, especially long-term rates, were to rise.
investment acquisitions. torchmark's investment policy calls for investing in fixed maturities that are investment grade and meet our quality and yield objectives. we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the long-term nature of our policy liabilities. we believe this strategy is appropriate because our cash flows are generally stable and predictable. if longer-term securities that meet our quality and yield objectives are not available, we do not relax our quality objectives, but instead, consider investing in shorter term or lower yielding securities, taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors.
during calendar years 2014 through 2016, torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixed maturity securities, primarily in corporate bonds with longer-term maturities. the following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity purchases for the last three years. the effective annual yield shown is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield, commonly referred to as the "worst call date." for non-callable bonds, the worst-call date is always the maturity date. for callable bonds, the worst-call date is the call date that produces the lowest yield, typically the first call date.

we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable (on other than a make-whole basis) prior to maturity, but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so. for investments in callable bonds, the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date. given our investments in callable bonds, the actual average life of our investments cannot be known at the time of the investment. however absent sales, the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity. data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart.
during the three years 2014 through 2016, acquisitions consisted of securities spanning a diversified range of issuers, industry sectors, and geographical regions. all of the acquired securities were investment grade. in addition to the fixed maturity acquisitions, torchmark invested $30 million in a limited partnership in 2015 with an additional investment in the partnership of $19 million in 2016. the limited partnership is a diversified investment fund that currently invests opportunistically in global credit assets with the potential for attractive returns relative to risk. it is classified within long-term investments.
new cash flow available for investment has been primarily provided through our insurance operations and interest received on existing investments. in some years, a significant amount of new investments can be derived from proceeds from dispositions including issuer calls. issuer calls, as a result of the low-interest environment experienced during the past three years, were an important factor. calls increase funds available for investment, but as noted earlier in this discussion, they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in

approximately 96% of our investments at book value are in a diversified fixed maturity portfolio. policy loans, which are secured by policy cash values, make up 3% of our investments. we also have insignificant investments in equity securities and other long-term investments. because fixed maturities represent such a significant portion of our investment portfolio, the remainder of the discussion of portfolio composition will focus on fixed maturities.

index to financial statements corporate securities, which consist of bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, were the largest component of the fixed maturity portfolio, representing 88% at both amortized cost and fair value. the remainder of the portfolio is invested primarily in securities issued by the u.s. government and u.s. municipalities. the company holds insignificant amounts in foreign government bonds, collateralized debt obligations, asset-backed securities, and agency mortgage-backed securities. corporate securities are diversified over a variety of industry sectors and issuers. as shown in the chart above, financial, utility, and energy sectors represented approximately 50% of the portfolio. corporate securities are diversified over a variety of industry sectors and issuers. at december 31, 2016, the total fixed maturity portfolio consists of 588 issuers, with 208 issuers within the financial, utility, and energy sectors.
the net unrealized gain of the fixed maturity portfolio increased $552 million from december 31, 2015. the utility, energy, and basic materials sectors experienced increases of $42 million, $249 million, and $129 million respectively, in net unrealized gains from december 31, 2015 to december 31, 2016, while the financial industry decreased $13 million. the fair value of the entire portfolio increased 11% for the period. over the past year, oil and many other commodity prices have increased meaningfully to the benefit of our holdings in the energy and basic materials sectors. while a sustained period of low prices might lead to some downgrades in ratings, we do not currently anticipate any losses from defaults or write-downs in the foreseeable future.

our investment policy regarding fixed maturities is to acquire only investment-grade obligations. thus, any increases in below investment-grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings. we have no direct investments in commercial or residential mortgages and we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts. we do not participate in securities lending, we have no off-balance sheet investments, and we have only an insignificant exposure to european sovereign debt consisting of $2 million in german government bonds at december 31, 2016. our exposure to puerto rican obligations is insignificant. on june 23, 2016, the united kingdom voted to depart the european union (eu) under the referendum commonly referred to as "brexit." although the formal separation from the eu will take time, the nature and extent of the effects on interest rates and economic performance are uncertain at this time. we do not expect an increase in other-than-temporary impairments on our limited exposure related to this event.
market risk sensitivity. torchmark's investment securities are exposed to interest rate risk, meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company's investment portfolio. since 96% of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed maturity investments (and virtually all of these investments are fixed-rate investments), the portfolio is highly subject to market risk. declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio rising and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline. under normal market conditions, we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because we have the ability and the intent to hold these investments to maturity. the long-term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cash-flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio. the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offsets the impact of rates on the investment portfolio. however, as is permitted by gaap, these liabilities are not recorded at fair value.

index to financial statements the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interest-rate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio at december 31, 2016 and 2015. this table measures the effect of a parallel shift in interest rates (as represented by the u.s. treasury curve) on the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio. the data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points.

realized gains and losses. our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits, sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future. because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods, premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations. for this reason, we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations. this portfolio consists primarily of high-quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long-term insurance product obligations. as a result, fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities. expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations.
investments are occasionally sold or called, resulting in a realized gain or loss. these gains and losses generally occur only incidentally, usually as the result of bonds sold because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers. investment losses are also caused by write downs due to impairments. we do not engage in trading investments for profit. therefore, gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield, or which result from events that are beyond our control, are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders.
realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations, and as a result, can have a material positive or negative impact on net income. the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause period-to-period trends of net income that are not indicative of historical core operating results or predictive of the future trends of core operations. accordingly, they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations. for these reasons, and in line with industry practice, we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results.

as described in note 4-investments under the caption other-than-temporary impairments, we have not incurred any write downs in our fixed maturity portfolio as a result of other-than-temporary impairment for the years 2014 through 2016.
financial condition liquidity. liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations. our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources: positive cash flow from operations, a portfolio of marketable securities, and a line of credit facility.
insurance subsidiary liquidity. the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs. sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income. cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes. the funds to provide for policy benefits, the majority of which are paid in future periods, are invested primarily in long-term fixed maturities to meet these long-term obligations. in addition to investment income, maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash. excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries' operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the parent company, subject to regulatory restriction. the dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries' prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains. while the leading source of the excess cash is investment income, due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control, a significant portion of the excess cash also comes from underwriting income.
parent company liquidity. cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on parent company debt, operating expenses of the parent, and parent company dividends to torchmark shareholders. in 2016, the parent received $438 million of cash dividends from its subsidiaries, compared with $466 million in 2015 and $479 million in 2014. including transfers from other subsidiaries and after paying debt obligations, shareholder dividends, and other expenses (but before share repurchases), the parent company had excess cash flow in 2016 of approximately $311 million, compared with $358 million in 2015 and $377 million in 2014. parent company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes, such as insurance subsidiary capital or financing needs, strategic acquisitions or share repurchases. in 2017, it is expected that the parent company will receive approximately $450 million in dividends and transfers from subsidiaries and that approximately $325 to $335 million will be available as excess cash flow. certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends. for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries, see the restrictions section of note 12-shareholders' equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements. although these restrictions exist, dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been more than sufficient for the cash flow needs of the parent company.
39
index to financial statements short-term borrowings. an additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to $750 million, which could be extended up to $1 billion. while torchmark can request the extension, it is not guaranteed. in may 2016, torchmark amended the facility to extend the maturity date to may 2021. the amendment also allowed for an additional $100 million term loan as discussed under the caption credit facility in note 11-debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements. the facility is further designated as a back-up line of credit for a commercial paper program as well as the stand-by letters of credit as discussed below. as of december 31, 2016, we had available $310 million of additional borrowing capacity under this facility, compared with $332 million a year earlier. there have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market during the three years ended december 31, 2016.
in summary, torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2017 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility. in the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed, the company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including, but not limited to, the issuance of additional debt, additional borrowings on our short-term credit facility, and intercompany borrowing.
consolidated liquidity. consolidated net cash inflows provided from continuing operations were $1.2 billion in 2016, compared with $1.1 billion in 2015 and $1.0 billion in 2014. in addition to cash inflows from operations, our companies received proceeds from maturities, calls, and repayments of fixed maturities in the amount of $236 million in 2016, compared with $376 million in 2015 and $273 million in 2014.
our cash and short-term investments were $148 million at year-end 2016 and $116 million at year-end 2015. additionally, we have a portfolio of marketable fixed securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need. these securities had a fair value of $15.2 billion at december 31, 2016. however, our strong cash flows from operations, investment maturities, and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely.
off-balance sheet arrangements. as a part of its aforementioned credit facility, torchmark had outstanding $177 million in stand-by letters of credit at december 31, 2016 and 2015. these letters are issued among our subsidiaries, one of which is an offshore captive reinsurer, and have no impact on company obligations as a whole. any future regulatory changes that restrict the use of off-shore captive reinsurers might require torchmark to obtain third-party financing, which could cause an immaterial increase in financing costs.
as of december 31, 2016, we had no unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third party entities. all of our guarantees were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries, as disclosed in note 15-commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

(1)   debt is itemized in note 11-debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
(2)   interest on debt is based on our fixed contractual obligations.
(3)   pension obligations are primarily liabilities in trust funds that are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans. they are offset by invested assets in the trusts, which are funded through periodic contributions by torchmark in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the obligations as they become due. therefore, our obligations are offset by those assets when reported on torchmark's consolidated balance sheets. at december 31, 2016, these pension obligations were $528 million, but there were also assets of $329 million in the pension entities. the schedule of pension benefit payments covers ten years and is based on the same assumptions used to measure the pension obligations, except there is no interest assumption because the payments are undiscounted. there are also obligations for benefits other than pensions with a liability of $24 million. please refer to note 9-postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on pension obligations.
(4)   future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force at december 31, 2016. these estimated payments were computed using assumptions for future mortality, morbidity and persistency. the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown. management believes that the assets supporting the liability of $12.8 billion at december 31, 2016, along with future premiums and investment income, will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations.
capital resources. torchmark's capital structure consists of short-term debt (the commercial paper facility described in note 11-debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the current maturity of funded debt), long-term funded debt, and shareholders' equity. a complete analysis and description of long-term debt issues outstanding is presented in note 11.
debt: the carrying value of the funded debt was $1.1 billion at december 31, 2016, compared with $993 million a year earlier. on april 5, 2016, torchmark completed the issuance and sale of $300 million aggregate principal amount of torchmark's 6.125% junior subordinated debentures due 2056. the debentures were sold pursuant to torchmark's shelf registration statement on form s-3, filed september 25, 2015. the net proceeds from the sale of the debentures were $290 million, after giving effect to the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering of the debentures. torchmark used the net proceeds from the offering of the debentures to repay the $250 million outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest of $8 million on its 6.375% senior notes that were due june 15, 2016. the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.
subsidiary capital: our insurance subsidiaries target a capital ratio of approximately 325% of company action level regulatory capital under risk-based capital (rbc), a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital. the 325% target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows, the relatively low risk of their product mix, and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for torchmark. at december 31, 2016, our insurance subsidiaries had an aggregate rbc ratio of approximately 324%. should we experience impairments and/or ratings downgrades within our fixed maturity portfolio in the future, the ratio could fall below targeted levels. in such a case, management believes more than sufficient liquidity exists at the parent company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the targeted ratio.
41
index to financial statements shareholder's equity: as noted under the caption summary of operations in this report, we have an ongoing share repurchase program. under this program, we acquired 5 million shares at a cost of $311 million in 2016, 6 million shares at a cost of $359 million in 2015, and 7 million shares for $375 million in 2014. the majority of purchased shares are retired each year. please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption summary of operations in this report.
torchmark has continually increased the quarterly dividend on its common shares over the past three years. in the first quarter of 2014, it was increased to $0.1267 per share from $0.1133 per share. in the first quarter of 2015, it was raised to $0.135 per share. finally, in the first quarter of 2016, dividends were raised to $0.14 per share.
shareholders' equity was $4.6 billion at december 31, 2016, compared with $4.1 billion at december 31, 2015. during the twelve months since december 31, 2015, shareholders' equity was reduced by the $311 million in share purchases under the repurchase program and $93 million to offset the dilution from stock option exercises. however, it was increased by $550 million of net income and $357 million of after-tax unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio.
we plan to use excess cash available at the parent company as efficiently as possible in the future. possible uses of excess cash flow include, but are not limited to, share repurchases, acquisitions, increases in shareholder dividends, investment in securities, or repayment of short-term debt. we will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that targeted capital levels are maintained in our companies.
we maintain a significant available-for-sale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders' liabilities. current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period. the period-to-period changes in fair value, net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax, are reflected directly in shareholders' equity. changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets. while invested assets are revalued, accounting rules do not permit interest-bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets, with changes in value applied directly to shareholders' equity. due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders' equity, this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders' equity. if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets, the effect on equity would be largely offset. fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period-to-period presentation of our shareholders' equity, capital structure, and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest-bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets. from time to time, the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders' equity. because of the long-term nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows consistently generated by our insurance subsidiaries, we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity. as such, we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets. accordingly, our management, credit rating agencies, lenders, many industry analysts, and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet, capital structure, and financial ratios.

(3)   due to the adoption of asu 2016-09 as described in note 1-significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under "accounting pronouncements adopted in current year", certain current year balances related to excess tax benefits from stock compensation were adjusted prospectively.
(4)   torchmark's debt covenants require that the effect of the accounting guidance requiring revaluation be removed to determine this ratio. this ratio is computed by dividing total debt by the sum of debt and shareholders' equity.
fasb guidance provides for an option which, if elected, would permit us to value our interest-bearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. however, unlike the accounting rule which permits us to account for changes in our available-for-sale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income, the guidance requires such changes to be recorded in earnings. because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt, the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile, causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results. therefore, we have not elected this option.
torchmark's ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements (times interest earned) was 10.3 times in 2016, compared with 11.0 times in 2015 and 11.3 times in 2014 based on continuing operations. this times-interest-earned ratio is computed by dividing interest expense into the sum of pre-tax income from continuing operations and interest expense. a discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report.
financial strength ratings. the financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries is rated by standard & poor's and a. m. best. the following chart presents these ratings for our five largest insurance subsidiaries at december 31, 2016.

index to financial statements a.m. best states that it assigns an a+ (superior) rating to insurance companies that have, in its opinion, a superior ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations. it assigns an a (excellent) rating to insurance companies that have, in its opinion, an excellent ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations.
the aa financial strength rating category is assigned by standard & poor's corporation (s&p) to those insurers which have very strong capacity to meet its financial commitments which differs from the highest-rated insurers only to a small degree. an insurer rated a has strong capacity to meet its financial commitments but it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than insurers in higher-rated categories. the plus sign (+) or minus sign (-) shows the relative standing within the major rating category.
during the fourth quarter of 2016, s&p reviewed our operations and financial outlook. based on their review, they confirmed our "aa-" financial strength ratings at our insurance subsidiaries and torchmark corporation's senior debt "a" credit rating. we intend to maintain adequate capital levels for s&p and any changes to our capital position to maintain such levels are not expected to have any significant impact on our share repurchase program or our financial results in future periods.
other items litigation. torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation, much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries. such punitive damage claims may have the potential for significant adverse results since torchmark and its subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions where large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded. this bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case. based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries, contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material. for more information concerning litigation, please refer to note 15-commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

index to financial statements critical accounting policies future policy benefits: due to the long-term nature of insurance contracts, our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future. the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry. the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1-significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
approximately 86% of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december 31, 2016 were traditional insurance liabilities where the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits. the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue. these assumptions are "locked in" and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts, except where there is a premium deficiency, as defined in note 1-significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption future policy benefits. otherwise, variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies. torchmark did not have a premium deficiency event for its traditional business during the three years ended december 31, 2016.
the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business, where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date. accordingly, there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business.
deferred acquisition costs: certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset. deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract as indicated in note 1-significant accounting policies under the caption deferred acquisition costs in the notes to consolidated financial statements. additionally, the cost of acquiring blocks of insurance business or insurance business through the purchase of other companies, known as the value of insurance purchased, is included in deferred acquisition costs. our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in note 1.
approximately 99% of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december 31, 2016 were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premium-paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums. the projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue. these assumptions are "locked-in" at that time and, except where there is a loss recognition issue, are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts. absent a premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume. we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended december 31, 2016.
the remaining 1% of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits. these contracts are not subject to lock-in. the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised. revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended december 31, 2016.
policy claims and other benefits payable: this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us. the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us. however, the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns. factors involved include the litigation environment, regulatory mandates, and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established, and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims. changes in these estimates, if any, are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made. we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, are the most appropriate under the circumstances. however, there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation. at this time, we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience.
45
index to financial statements valuation of fixed maturities: we hold a substantial investment in high-quality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time. while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity, they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time, primarily to manage risk. we report this portfolio at fair value. fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction. the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets, having a greater impact on longer-term maturities. because of the size of our fixed maturity portfolio, small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company. this impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption market risk sensitivity in this report. however, as discussed under the caption financial condition in this report, we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and, as such, we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios.
at times, the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets. illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening, and accordingly unrealized losses, on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable. even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale, we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products. considerable information concerning the policies, procedures, classification levels, and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed maturity investments is presented in note 1-significant accounting policies and in note 4-investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the captions fair value measurements in both notes.
impairment of investments: we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments where fair value has declined below carrying value and that have become impaired in value. while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions, an other-than-temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary. the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note 1-significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report. while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other-than-temporary impairment, it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security.
defined benefit pension plans: we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full-time employees. we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees. our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions. in accordance with gaap, an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time. these obligations are offset, at least in part, by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans. at december 31, 2016, our gross liability under these plans was $528 million, but was offset by assets of $329 million.
46
index to financial statements the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover, retirement age, the expected return on plan assets, projected salary increases, and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled. these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation. a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation. a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation. small changes in assumptions may cause significant differences in reported results for these plans. for example, a sensitivity analysis is presented below for the impact of change in the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on assets assumed on our defined benefit pension plans expense for the year 2016 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31, 2016.

(2)   the expected return rate assumed was 7.19%.
the company determines mortality assumptions through the use of published mortality tables that reflect broad-based studies of mortality and published longevity improvement scales. during 2014, the company revised the mortality assumptions based on an evaluation of a new mortality table and longevity scale released by the society of actuaries. the change in these assumptions added approximately $26 million to the projected benefit obligation as of december 31, 2014.
the criteria used to determine the primary assumptions are discussed in note 9-postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements. while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions, given the information available from company experience, economic data, independent consultants and other sources, we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected. the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised, if necessary, based on more current information available to us. note 9 also contains information about pension plan assets, investment policies, and other related data.

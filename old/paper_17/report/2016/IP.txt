item 1a. risk factors in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k (particularly in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations), or in the company's other filings with the securities and exchange commission, the following are some important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement.
risks relating to industry conditions changes in the cost or availability of raw materials, energy and transportation could affect our profitability. we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials (principally virgin wood fiber, recycled fiber, caustic soda and starch), energy sources (principally natural gas, coal and fuel oil) and third-party companies that transport our goods. the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source. in addition, the increase in demand of products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a global basis, may cause an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber. energy prices, in particular prices for oil and natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future. our profitability has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials, energy sources and transportation sources.
the industries in which we operate experience both economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences. fluctuations in the prices of, and the demand for, our products could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions. the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product. in addition, changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiber-based products and non-fiber substitutes. these consumer preferences affect the prices of our products. consequently, our operating cash flow is sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products.
competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results. we operate in a competitive environment, both in the united states and internationally, in all of our operating segments. product innovations, manufacturing and operating efficiencies, and marketing, distribution and pricing strategies
7
pursued or achieved by competitors could negatively impact our financial results.
risks relating to market and economic factors adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations. general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels and consumer confidence, all of which impact demand for our products. in addition, volatility in the capital and credit markets, which impacts interest rates, currency exchange rates and the availability of credit, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations.
the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business. as of december 31, 2016, international paper had approximately $11.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness. the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition, operating results and business, including the following:
•   it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, dividends, share repurchases, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;
•   a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;
•   the debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy other obligations;
•   our indebtedness that is subject to variable rates of interest exposes us to increased debt service obligations in the event of increased interest rates;
•   it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and
•   it may increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, and may make us unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.
in addition, we are subject to agreements that require meeting and maintaining certain financial ratios and covenants. a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives.
changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. maintaining an investment-grade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy, and a downgrade of the company's ratings below investment grade may limit our access to the capital markets, have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position. the company's desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow, including sale of assets, suspension or reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital.
under the terms of the agreements governing approximately $2.3 billion of our debt as of december 31, 2016, the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade. as a result, a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade may lead to an increase in our interest expense. there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency's judgment, circumstances so warrant. any such downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur.
downgrades in the credit ratings of banks issuing certain letters of credit will increase our cost of maintaining certain indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes. we are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes delivered to temple-inland in connection with temple-inland's 2007 sales of forestlands may be downgraded below a required rating. since 2007, certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced, or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement. as a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment, a number of
8
the letter-of-credit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited. the downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letter-of-credit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to $831 million in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained. the deferred taxes are currently recorded in the company's consolidated financial statements. see note 12, variable interest entities, on pages 64 through 66, and note 10, income taxes, on pages 59 through 61, in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change. we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all u.s. salaried employees hired prior to july 1, 2004 and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date. we provide retiree health care benefits to certain former u.s. hourly employees, as well as financial assistance towards the cost of individual retiree medical coverage for certain former u.s. salaried employees. our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in increased pension costs in future periods. likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs.  health care reform under the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010, and modifications thereto, could also increase costs with respect to medical coverage of the company's full-time employees. significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
our pension plans are currently underfunded, and over time we may be required to make cash payments to the plans, reducing the cash available for our business. we record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets. the benefit liability recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification (asc) 715, "compensation - retirement benefits," at december 31, 2016 was $3.4 billion. the amount and timing of future contributions will depend upon a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.
changes in international conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations. our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products. specifically, russia, brazil, poland, india, and turkey, where we have substantial manufacturing facilities, are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world. fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the u.s. dollar, downturns in economic activity, adverse tax consequences, nationalization or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results. trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including governmental subsidies, tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over international paper, may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries. in addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under u.s. law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions. for example, the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits u.s. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations.
risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs we are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and other government requirements that may change in significant ways, and the cost of compliance with such requirements could impact our business and results of operations. our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of u.s. federal and state and non-u.s. laws, regulations and other government requirements -- including, among others, those relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, data privacy, and health care. there can be no assurance that laws, regulations and government requirements will not be changed, applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs. for example, we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and
9
regulations. there can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements, including with global climate change laws and regulations, boiler mact and naaqss, will not require significant expenditures, or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs. we could also incur substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances. as another example, we are subject to a number of labor and employment laws and regulations that could significantly increase our operating costs and reduce our operational flexibility.
results of legal proceedings could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty. although we do not believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims will have a material effect on our business or consolidated financial statements, there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected.
risks relating to our operations material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results. we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities. a material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively impact our financial condition. any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:
•   fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes;
•   the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply;
•   the effect of other severe weather conditions on equipment and facilities;
•   terrorism or threats of terrorism;
•   domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to our company and our business partners, including joint venture partners, around the world;
•   unscheduled maintenance outages;
•   prolonged power failures;
•   an equipment failure;
•   a chemical spill or release;
•   explosion of a boiler or other equipment;
•   damage or disruptions caused by third parties operating on or adjacent to one of our manufacturing facilities;
•   disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;
•   widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis;
•   labor difficulties; and
•   other operational problems.
any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned expenditures. if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results.
for example, on january 22, 2017, we experienced significant structural damage to the largest pulp digester as well as the power house at our pensacola pulp and paper mill in cantonment, florida. we restarted the power house and resumed partial operations producing fluff pulp at the mill using a series of small batch digesters within a couple weeks. repairing the damaged digester will take more time, however, and we know that we will not be able to resume full operations producing containerboard at the mill during the first quarter of 2017.
we are subject to information technology risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company, customer, employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology used to manage operations and other business processes. our business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture, processing, storage and reporting. despite careful security and controls design,
10
implementation, updating and independent third party verification, our information technology systems, and those of our third party providers, could become subject to employee error or malfeasance, cyber attacks, or natural disasters. network, system, application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with international paper. access to internal applications required to plan our operations, source materials, manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused. theft of intellectual property or trade secrets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, employee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents. any of these operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could result in lost sales, business delays, negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business.
certain operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit. certain operations in russia are carried on by a joint venture, ilim. in joint ventures, we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. in general, joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. in joint ventures, we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our co-owners as well as with the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, our relationship may be adversely affected. in addition, the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so we receive only our portion of those benefits.
we may not achieve the expected benefits from acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures and other corporate transactions. our strategy for long-term growth, productivity and profitability depends, in part, on our ability to accomplish prudent acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures and other corporate transactions and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions, and we are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits. among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities or access to new markets (or a combination thereof), and in the case of divestitures, the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers who place higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than does international paper.
on december 1, 2016, for example, we completed our acquisition of weyerhaeuser's pulp business. the success of the acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities from integrating the acquired business with our existing businesses. the integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming, and we may not accomplish the integration of the business smoothly, successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframe. potential integration risks include, among other things, our ability to successfully implement our business plan for the combined business and retain key customers, suppliers and employees.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary diluted earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders were $904 million ($2.18 per share) in 2016, compared with $938 million ($2.23 per share) in 2015 and $555 million ($1.29 per share) in 2014. adjusted operating earnings is a non-gaap measure and is defined as net earnings from continuing operations (a gaap measure) excluding special items and non-operating pension expense. international paper generated adjusted operating earnings attributable to common shareholders of $1.4 billion ($3.35 per share) in 2016, compared with $1.5 billion ($3.65 per share) in 2015, and $1.3 billion ($3.00 per share) in 2014 (see reconciliation on page 19).
despite a tough global environment, international paper delivered another year of solid performance, with continued strong cash flow generation and a return on invested capital in excess of our cost of capital. during 2016, we took steps to further strengthen our portfolio. we completed the acquisition of weyerhaeuser's pulp business, which we have combined with ip's legacy pulp business to form our new global cellulose fibers business. we also completed the conversion of a machine at the riegelwood, north carolina mill to produce fluff pulp, which coupled with the newly acquired pulp business, gives the company the capacity to grow both fluff and high-value specialty pulp products. in addition, we also acquired a top-quartile mill asset in madrid, which we will convert in the second half of 2017 to produce recycled containerboard to support our emea industrial packaging business. finally, we were able to return cash to our shareholders in the form of a 5% increase in the annual dividend, making it the fifth consecutive year of a dividend increase.
our 2016 results reflect margin pressure across most of our businesses throughout the year along with escalating input costs, primarily natural gas and occ, in the later portion of the year. full-year 2016 earnings were impacted by price erosion and weaker mix across many of our businesses, in particular, our north american industrial packaging business which experienced lower export pricing and the impact of early 2016 pricing index changes to boxes. volume was positive compared to 2015, primarily driven by increased north american box demand. manufacturing operations, despite solid performance across our mill systems, were negatively impacted by the riegelwood conversion and ramp up, hurricane matthew, and inventory valuation charges associated with the october containerboard price increase. we did see signs of strengthening in some of our key markets in the second half of the year, which enabled us to announce and implement price increases across various businesses that will benefit us in 2017. our ilim joint venture had another solid year in 2016, experiencing strong demand which led to record full-year production.
looking ahead to the 2017 first quarter, we expect sales volumes for north american industrial packaging to be slightly higher despite seasonally lower daily shipments due to four more shipping days. sales volumes for global cellulose fibers will be higher due to the full-quarter impact of the newly acquired pulp business. in addition, sales volumes for emea industrial packaging, north american printing papers and north american consumer packaging are also expected to be seasonally higher. pricing is expected to increase for both north american industrial packaging and brazilian industrial packaging, reflecting the continuing implementation of box price increases announced in 2016. pricing for both north american printing papers and north american consumer packaging is expected to be lower due to market pressures. planned maintenance outages are expected to increase due to a heavy outage quarter, including a significant outage currently underway at the global cellulose fibers port wentworth mill. input costs are expected to increase primarily for our north american operations, largely driven by natural gas, wood and occ. additionally, we expect the results of ilim to be sequentially lower, primarily due to seasonally lower volumes and seasonally higher input costs.
looking to full year 2017, we are encouraged by an improving economic climate and are eager to begin the integration of our newly acquired pulp business, driving the anticipated synergies to the bottom line. we expect higher earnings in our north american industrial packaging business through benefits from the previously announced price increase, growing demand from our customers and improvement initiatives. we also expect to improve margins with continued strong operations and extensive cost reduction efforts across many of our other businesses. additionally, we are on track for our planned conversion of the madrid mill in the second half of the year, which will enable a better offering for our customers and earnings improvement for our emea industrial packaging business. finally, with the strong cash flow that we expect from all of these initiatives, we will continue to allocate capital to create value with a near-term focus on debt reduction and returning value to our shareholders.
adjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings per share are non-gaap measures. diluted earnings (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders are the most direct comparable gaap measures. the company calculates adjusted operating earnings by excluding the after-tax effect of items considered by management to be unusual, from the earnings reported under gaap, non-operating pension expense (includes all u.s. pension costs, excluding service costs and prior service costs), and
18
discontinued operations. adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted operating earnings by diluted average shares of common stock outstanding. management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. the company believes that using this information, along with the most direct comparable gaap measure, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations.
diluted earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders were $0.53 in the 2016 fourth quarter, compared with $0.75 in the 2016 third quarter and $0.43 in the 2015 fourth quarter. adjusted operating earnings attributable to common shareholders of $303 million ($0.73 per share) in the 2016 fourth quarter were lower than both the $380 million ($0.91 per share) in the 2016 third quarter and the $361 million ($0.87 per share) in the 2015 fourth quarter.
the following are reconciliations of diluted earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders to adjusted operating earnings attributable to common shareholders.

free cash flow is a non-gaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure is cash provided by operations. management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available, after reinvesting in the business, to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay dividends, repurchase stock, repay debt and make investments for future growth. it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. by adjusting for certain items that are not indicative of the company's ongoing performance, free cash flow also enables investors to perform meaningful comparisons between
19
past and present periods. free cash flow of $1.9 billion generated in 2016 was higher than the $1.8 billion generated in 2015, but lower than the $2.1 billion generated in 2014 (see reconciliation on page 30).
free cash flow of $467 million generated in the 2016 fourth quarter was lower than the $575 million generated in the 2016 third quarter and the $501 million generated in the 2015 fourth quarter (see reconciliation on page 30).
results of operations business segment operating profits are used by international paper's management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. business segment operating profits are defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings, but including the impact of equity earnings and noncontrolling interests, excluding corporate items and corporate special items. business segment operating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a non-gaap financial measure, and are not gaap alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states.
international paper operates in four segments: industrial packaging, global cellulose fibers, printing papers and consumer packaging.

business segment operating profits in 2016 included a net loss from special items of $136 million compared with $321 million in 2015 and $732 million in 2014. operationally, compared with 2015, the benefits from higher sales volumes ($62 million), lower maintenance outage costs ($14 million), lower input costs ($82 million) and the incremental operating earnings from the newly acquired pulp business ($17 million) were offset by lower average sales price realizations and mix ($443 million), higher operating costs ($62 million) and higher other costs ($14 million).
20
the principal changes in operating profit by segment were as follows:
•   industrial packaging's profits of $1.7 billion were $202 million lower than in 2015 as the benefits of higher sales volumes, lower maintenance outage costs and lower input costs were more than offset by lower average sales price realizations and mix, higher operating costs and higher other costs. in addition, operating profits in 2016 included a charge of $70 million for impairment and other costs associated with the sale of our corrugated packaging business in asia and a charge of $7 million related to the closure of a mill in turkey. in 2015, operating profits included a goodwill and trade name impairment charge of $137 million related to our brazil packaging business.
•   global cellulose fibers' operating loss of $180 million was $248 million unfavorable versus 2015 as the benefits of higher sales volumes, lower input costs, lower other costs and the earnings from the newly acquired business were more than offset by lower average sales price realizations and mix, higher operating costs and higher maintenance outage costs. the operating loss in 2016 included $31 million of costs associated with the acquisition of the pulp business and a charge of $19 million to amortize the newly acquired pulp business inventory fair value adjustment.
•   printing papers' profits of $540 million represented a $75 million increase in operating profits from 2015. the benefits from higher sales volumes, higher average sales price realizations and mix, lower operating costs, lower maintenance outage costs and lower input costs were partially offset by higher other costs.
•   consumer packaging's operating profit of $191 million represented a $216 million increase in operating profits from 2015. the benefits from lower operating costs, lower maintenance outage costs, and lower input costs were partially offset by lower sales volumes, lower average sales price realizations and mix and higher other costs. in addition, operating profits in 2016 included a charge of $9 million related to the conversion of our riegelwood mill to 100% pulp production. in 2015, operating losses included an asset impairment charge of $174 million related to the sale of our 55% equity share of the ip-sun jv in asia, a net cost of $8 million related to costs for our riegelwood mill conversion, net of proceeds from the sale of the carolina coated bristols brand, and $2 million of sheet plant closure costs.
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december 31, 2016, international paper generated $2.5 billion of cash flow from operations compared with $2.6 billion in 2015 and $3.1 billion in 2014. cash flow from operations included $750 million, $750 million and $353 million of cash pension contributions in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. capital spending for 2016 totaled $1.3 billion, or 110% of depreciation and amortization expense. net increases in debt totaled $1.9 billion, the proceeds from which were primarily used to fund the acquisition of the weyerhaeuser pulp business. our liquidity position remains strong, supported by approximately $2.1 billion of credit facilities that we believe are adequate to meet future liquidity requirements. maintaining an investment-grade credit rating for our long-term debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy.
we expect strong cash generation again in 2017 and will continue our balanced use of cash through the payment of dividends, reducing total debt and making investments for future growth.
capital spending for 2017 is targeted at $1.5 billion, or about 107% of depreciation and amortization.

results of operations while the operating results for international paper's various business segments are driven by a number of business-specific factors, changes in international paper's operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic conditions in north america, europe, russia, latin america, asia, africa and the middle east. factors that impact the demand for our products include industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels, and movements in currency exchange rates.
21
product prices are affected by general economic trends, inventory levels, currency exchange rate movements and worldwide capacity utilization. in addition to these revenue-related factors, net earnings are impacted by various cost drivers, the more significant of which include changes in raw material costs, principally wood, recycled fiber and chemical costs; energy costs; freight costs; salary and benefits costs, including pensions; and manufacturing conversion costs.
the following is a discussion of international paper's results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016, and the major factors affecting these results compared to 2015 and 2014.

compared with 2015, the benefits from higher sales volumes, lower maintenance outage costs, lower input costs, incremental earnings from the acquisition of weyerhaeuser's pulp business, lower interest expense and lower tax expense were offset by lower average sales price realizations and mix, higher operating costs and higher corporate and other costs. in addition, 2016 results included higher equity earnings, net of taxes, relating to the company's investment in ilim holding, sa.
see business segment results on pages 25 through 30 for a discussion of the impact of these factors by segment.

in 2016, there was $5 million of discontinued operations expense associated with a legal settlement related to the xpedx business.
2015:
there were no discontinued operations in 2015.
2014:
in 2014, $24 million of net income adjustments were recorded relating to discontinued businesses, including $16 million of costs associated with the spin-off of the xpedx business and $9 million of costs associated with the divestiture of the temple-inland building products business. also included are the operating earnings of the xpedx business prior to the spin-off on july 1, 2014.

a net income tax provision of $466 million was recorded for 2015 including a tax benefit of $62 million related to internal restructurings, a tax expense of $23 million for the tax impact of the 2015 cash pension contribution of $750 million and a $2 million tax expense for other
22
items. excluding these items, an $83 million net tax benefit for other special items and a $101 million tax benefit related to non-operating pension expense, the tax provision was $687 million, or 33% of pre-tax earnings before equity earnings.
a net income tax provision of $123 million was recorded for 2014 including a tax benefit of $90 million related to internal restructurings and a net $9 million tax expense for other items. excluding these items, a $372 million net tax benefit for other special items and a $83 million tax benefit related to non-operating pension expense, the tax provision was $659 million, or 31% of pre-tax earnings before equity earnings.
equity earnings, net of taxes equity earnings, net of taxes in 2016, 2015 and 2014 consisted principally of the company's share of earnings from its 50% investment in ilim holding s.a. in russia (see page 29 and 30).
interest expense and noncontrolling interest net corporate interest expense totaled $520 million in 2016, $555 million in 2015 and $601 million in 2014. the decrease in 2016 compared with 2015 is due to lower average interest rates. the decrease in 2015 compared with 2014 also reflects lower average interest rates.
net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests totaled a loss of $2 million in 2016 compared with a loss of $21 million in 2015 and a loss of $19 million in 2014. the decrease in 2016 reflects the sale of our equity share of the ip-sun jv in 2015. the decrease in 2015 compared with 2014 also reflects the sale of our interest in the ip-sun jv and lower earnings for the joint venture in china prior to its divestiture.
special items restructuring and other charges international paper continually evaluates its operations for improvement opportunities targeted to (a) focus our portfolio on our core businesses, (b) realign capacity to operate fewer facilities with the same revenue capability and close high cost facilities, and (c) reduce costs. annually, strategic operating plans are developed by each of our businesses. if it subsequently becomes apparent that a facility's plan will not be achieved, a decision is then made to, among other outcomes, (a) invest additional capital to upgrade the facility, (b) shut down the facility and record the corresponding charge, or (c) evaluate the expected recovery of the carrying value of the facility to determine if an impairment of the assets have occurred. in recent years, this policy has led to the shutdown of a number of facilities and the recording of significant asset impairment charges and severance costs. it is possible that additional charges and costs will be incurred in future periods in our core businesses should such triggering events occur.
during 2016, 2015 and 2014, pre-tax restructuring and other charges totaling $54 million, $252 million and $846 million were recorded in the business segments. details of these charges are as follows:

liquidity and capital resources overview a major factor in international paper's liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow, which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products. while changes in key cash operating costs, such as energy, raw material and transportation costs, do have an effect on operating cash generation, we believe that our focus on pricing and cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle.
cash uses during 2016 were primarily focused on working capital requirements, capital spending, debt reductions, pension contributions, the acquisitions of the weyerhaeuser pulp business and the mill asset in madrid, and returning cash to shareholders.
cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operations totaled $2.5 billion in 2016 compared with $2.6 billion for 2015 and $3.1 billion for 2014. cash provided by working capital components, accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities, interest payable and other totaled $71 million in 2016, compared with a cash use of $222 million in 2015 and a cash use of $158 million in 2014.

in october 2015, international paper announced that the quarterly dividend would be increased from $0.40 per share to $0.44 per share, effective for the 2015 fourth quarter.
2014: financing activities during 2014 included debt issuances of $2.0 billion and retirements of $2.1 billion, for a net decrease of $113 million.
international paper utilizes interest rate swaps to change the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and manage interest expense. at december 31, 2014, international paper had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $230 million and maturities in 2018 (see note 14 derivatives and hedging activities on pages 67 through 70 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data). during 2014, existing swaps and the amortization of deferred gains on previously terminated swaps decreased the weighted average cost of debt from 6.8% to an effective rate of 6.7%. the inclusion of the offsetting interest income from short-term investments reduced this effective rate to 6.3%.
during the second quarter of 2014, international paper issued $800 million of 3.65% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date in 2024 and $800 million of 4.80% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date in 2044. the proceeds from this borrowing were used to repay approximately $960 million of notes with interest rates ranging from 7.95% to 9.38% and original maturities from 2018 to 2019. pre-tax early debt retirement costs of $262 million related to these debt repayments, including $258 million of cash premiums, are included in restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014.
other financing activities during 2014 included the net repurchase of approximately 17.9 million shares of treasury stock, including restricted stock withholding, and the issuance of 1.6 million shares of common stock for various plans, including stock options exercises that generated approximately $66 million of cash. repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $1.06 billion, including $983 million related to shares repurchased under the company's share repurchase program.
in september 2014, international paper announced that the quarterly dividend would be increased from $0.35 per share to $0.40 per share, effective for the 2014 fourth quarter.
variable interest entities information concerning variable interest entities is set forth in note 12 variable interest entities on pages 64 through 66 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for discussion.
liquidity and capital resources outlook for 2017
capital expenditures and long-term debt international paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures, service existing debt and meet working capital and dividend requirements during 2017 through current cash balances and cash from operations. additionally, the company has existing credit facilities totaling $2.1 billion available at december 31, 2016.
the company's financial covenants require the maintenance of a minimum net worth of $9 billion and
32
a total debt-to-capital ratio of less than 60%. net worth is defined as the sum of common stock, paid-in capital and retained earnings, less treasury stock plus any cumulative goodwill impairment charges. the calculation also excludes accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities. the total debt-to-capital ratio is defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus net worth. the company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at december 31, 2016 and was well below the thresholds stipulated under the covenants as defined in the credit agreements.
the company will continue to rely upon debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows. funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives. the primary goals of the company's capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while reducing interest expense. the majority of international paper's debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors.
maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper's financing strategy. at december 31, 2016, the company held long-term credit ratings of bbb (stable outlook) and baa2 (stable outlook) by s&p and moody's, respectively.
contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31, 2016, were as follows:
in millions                                 2017            2018            2019          2020            2021        thereafter maturities of long-term debt (a)        $239            $690            $433          $179            $612          $9,161

(a)   total debt includes scheduled principal payments only.
(b)   includes $2 billion relating to fiber supply agreements entered into at the time of the 2006 transformation plan forestland sales and in conjunction with the 2008 acquisition of weyerhaeuser company's containerboard, packaging and recycling business. also includes $1.1 billion relating to fiber supply agreements assumed in conjunction with the 2016 acquisition of weyerhaeuser's pulp business.
(c)   not included in the above table due to the uncertainty as to the amount and timing of the payment are unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $77 million.
we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2016, to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no u.s. income taxes have been provided thereon. as of december 31, 2016, the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $620 million. we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.
pension obligations and funding at december 31, 2016, the projected benefit obligation for the company's u.s. defined benefit plans determined under u.s. gaap was approximately $3.4 billion higher than the fair value of plan assets. approximately $3.0 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements. under current irs funding rules, the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits(the projected benefit obligation) for accounting purposes. in december 2008, the worker, retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 (wera) was passed by the u.s. congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections. funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company, and the timing of its implementation, as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level. the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected to make contributions totaling $750 million for both years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015. at this time, we do not expect to have any required contributions to our plans in 2017, although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions. the timing and amount of future contributions, which could be material, will depend on a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates. international paper announced a voluntary, limited-time opportunity for former employees who are participants in the retirement plan of international paper company (the pension plan) to request early payment of their entire pension plan benefit in the form of a single lump sum payment. the amount of total payments under this program was approximately $1.2 billion, and were made from plan trust assets on june 30, 2016. based on the level of payments made, settlement accounting rules applied and resulted in a plan remeasurement as of the june 30, 2016 payment date. as a result of settlement accounting, the company recognized a pro-rata portion of the unamortized net actuarial loss, after remeasurement, resulting in a $439 million non-cash charge to the company's earnings in the second quarter of 2016. additional payments of $8 million and $9 million were made during the third and fourth quarters, respectively, due to mandatory cash payouts and a small lump sum payout, and the pension plan was subsequently remeasured at september 30, 2016 and december 31, 2016. as a result of settlement accounting, the company recognized non-cash settlement charges of $3 million in both the third and fourth quarters of 2016.

ilim holding s.a. shareholder's agreement in october 2007, in connection with the formation of the ilim holding s.a. joint venture, international paper entered into a shareholder's agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners. this agreement provides that at any time, either the company or its partners may commence procedures specified under the deadlock agreement. if these or any other deadlock procedures under the shareholder's agreement are commenced, although it is not obligated to do so, the company may in certain situations choose to purchase its partners' 50% interest in ilim. any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by russian and other relevant anti-trust authorities. based on the provisions of the agreement, the company estimates that the current purchase price for its partners' 50% interests would be approximately $1.5 billion, which could be satisfied by payment of cash or international paper common stock, or some combination of the two, at the company's option. the purchase by the company of its partners' 50% interest in ilim would result in the consolidation of ilim's financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods. the parties have informed each other that they have no current intention to commence procedures specified under the deadlock provisions of the shareholder's agreement.
critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.
accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper, and that can require judgments by management that affect their application, include the accounting for contingencies, impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and goodwill, pensions and postretirement benefit obligations, stock options and income taxes. the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit and finance committee of the company's board of directors.
contingent liabilities accruals for contingent liabilities, including legal and environmental matters, are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel. liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs.
impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill an impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through cash flows from future operations. a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. assessments of possible impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations. additionally, testing for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually. the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets based on management's best estimates of certain key factors, including future selling prices and volumes, operating, raw material, energy and freight costs, and various other projected operating economic factors. as these key factors change in future periods, the company will update its impairment analyses to reflect its latest estimates and projections.
under the provisions of accounting standards codification (asc) 350, "intangibles - goodwill and other," the testing of goodwill for possible impairment is a two-step process. in the first step, the fair value of the company's reporting units is compared with their carrying value, including goodwill. if fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered to be impaired. if the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value, then step two is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss for the reporting unit. this analysis requires the determination of the fair value of all of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any currently unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been purchased on the analysis date. once these fair values have been determined, the implied fair value of the unit's goodwill is calculated as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets determined in step two. the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to this implied value, or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, through a goodwill impairment charge.
the impairment analysis requires a number of judgments by management. in calculating the estimated fair value of its reporting units in step one,
34
the company uses the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit, discounted using the estimated discount rate for each reporting unit. these calculations require many estimates, including discount rates, future growth rates, and cost and pricing trends for each reporting unit. subsequent changes in economic and operating conditions can affect these assumptions and could result in additional interim testing and goodwill impairment charges in future periods. upon completion, the resulting estimated fair values are then analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to earnings multiples for historic industry business transactions, and by comparing the sum of the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares outstanding to the company's market price per share on the analysis date.
no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2016.
in the fourth quarter of 2015, in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments, the company calculated the estimated fair value of its brazil packaging business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill in the business, totaling $137 million, should be written off. the decline in the fair value of the brazil packaging business and resulting impairment charge was due to the negative impacts on the cash flows of the business caused by the continued decline of the overall brazilian economy.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments, the company calculated the estimated fair value of its asia industrial packaging business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill in this business, totaling $100 million, should be written off. the decline in the fair value of the asia industrial packaging business and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the strategic outlook for the business.
pension and postretirement benefit obligations the charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper's consulting actuary, and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, projected future compensation increases, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates.
the calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities, the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates.
benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31, 2016, for international paper's pension and postretirement plans were as follows:
in millions                         benefit   fair value of obligation   plan assets u.s. qualified pension        $13,307         $10,312

non-u.s. postretirement            23         -
the table below shows assumptions used by international paper to calculate u.s. pension obligations for the years shown:
2016                                            2015        2014

additionally, health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of u.s. postretirement obligations for the years shown were:
2016                                                                           2015

rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to           5.00   %    5.00    %
year that the rate reaches the rate it is assumed to remain   2022   2022
international paper determines these actuarial assumptions, after consultation with our actuaries, on december 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan's investment portfolio. the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds.
the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended december 31, 2016 was 7.75%.
increasing (decreasing) the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets by an additional 0.25% would decrease (increase) 2017 pension expense by approximately $26 million, while a (decrease) increase of 0.25% in the discount rate would (increase) decrease pension expense by approximately $33 million. the effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1%
35
increase or decrease in the annual health care cost trend rate would be approximately $1 million.
actual rates of return earned on u.s. pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were:
year       return   year        return
2016    7.1   %     2011     2.5   %
2015    1.3   %     2010    15.1   %
2014    6.4   %     2009    23.8   %
2013   14.1   %     2008   (23.6   )%
2012   14.1   %     2007     9.6   %
the 2012, 2013 and 2014 returns above represent weighted averages of international paper and temple-inland asset returns. international paper and temple-inland assets were combined in october 2014. the annualized time-weighted rate of return earned on u.s. pension plan assets was 8.5% and 6.3% for the past five and ten years, respectively. the following graph shows the growth of a $1,000 investment in international paper's u.s. pension plan master trust. the graph portrays the time-weighted rate of return from 2006 - 2016.
asc 715, "compensation - retirement benefits," provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets, and other assumption changes. these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years. the estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost for the u.s. pension plans over the next fiscal year are $341 million and $28 million, respectively.
net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses, calculated for all of international paper's plans, were as follows:
in millions                 2016          2015          2014          2013          2012

non-u.s. plans                 4             6             -             5             3
postretirement expense u.s. plans                    13             8             7            (1   )        (4   )
non-u.s. plans                 1             5             7             7             1
net expense                 $827          $480          $401          $556          $342
the increase in 2016 u.s. pension expense principally reflects a decrease in the discount rate and a large settlement charge in 2016 related to the optional lump sum payout partially offset by a higher return on assets and lower amortization of actuarial losses.
assuming that discount rates, expected long-term returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as in 2016, projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows:
in millions                  2018 (1)       2017 (1)
pension expense u.s. plans (non-cash)       $252           $310
non-u.s. plans                 3              4
postretirement expense u.s. plans                    15             18
non-u.s. plans                 1              1
net expense                 $271           $333
(1)   based on assumptions at december 31, 2016.
the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately $310 million for its u.s. defined benefit plans in 2017, with the decrease from expense of $809 million in 2016 mainly related to no expected settlement charges in 2017 and an increase in the assumed discount rate to 4.10% in 2017 from 4.05% in 2016, partially offset by a lower return on asset assumption of 7.50% in 2017, down from 7.75% in 2016.
the market value of plan assets for international paper's u.s. qualified pension plan at december 31, 2016 totaled approximately $10.3 billion, consisting of approximately 51% equity securities, 27% debt securities, 10% real estate and 12% other assets. plan assets include an immaterial amount of international paper common stock.
the company's funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate
36
considering the funded status of the plan, tax deductibility, the cash flows generated by the company, and other factors. the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future. there are no required contributions to the u.s. qualified plan in 2017. the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments, which totaled $21 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.
income taxes international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns. where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the company's evaluation of the "more likely than not" outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, change in tax laws, or a recent court case that addresses the matter.
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies.
while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts.
the company's effective income tax rates, before equity earnings and discontinued operations, were 26%, 37% and 14% for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. these effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items that can significantly affect the effective income tax rate in a given year, but may not recur in subsequent years. management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special items were to occur in those years. excluding these special items, the effective income tax rate for 2016 was 32% of pre-tax earnings compared with 33% in 2015 and 31% in 2014. we estimate that the 2017 effective income tax rate will be approximately 33% based on expected earnings and business conditions.
business combinations the company's acquisitions of businesses are accounted for in accordance with asc 805, "business combinations", as amended. we allocate the total purchase price of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value as of the business combination date. in developing estimates of fair values for long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, the company utilizes a variety of inputs including forecasted cash flows, anticipated growth rates, discount rates, estimated replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence factors. determining the fair value for specifically identified intangible assets such as customer lists and developed technology involves judgment. we may refine our estimates and make adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed over a measurement period, not to exceed one year. upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are charged to the consolidated statements of earnings. subsequent actual results of the underlying business activity supporting the specifically identified intangible assets could change, requiring us to record impairment charges or adjust their economic lives in future periods.
recent accounting developments there were no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year which have had or are expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements. see note 2 recent accounting developments on pages 49 through 52 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.
legal proceedings information concerning the company's environmental and legal proceedings is set forth in note 11 commitments and contingencies on pages 61 through 63 of item  8. financial statements and supplementary data.
effect of inflation while inflationary increases in certain input costs, such as energy, wood fiber and chemical costs, have an impact on the company's operating results, changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years. sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors.

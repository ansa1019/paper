item 1a. risk factors in the ordinary course of our business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance and financial risks. these risks could have an impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
our enterprise risk management (erm) process seeks to identify and address significant risks. our erm process uses the integrated risk framework in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso) to assess, manage and monitor risks. we believe that risk-taking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our growth and performance strategy. our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoiding risks. we can mitigate risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extent.
a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks. our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks. the audit committee of the board of directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them. our other board committees also play a role in risk management, as set forth in their respective charters.
our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value. however, the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results and could adversely affect us.
adverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in decreases in our sales and profitability.
we are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur, we may experience reduced orders, payment delays or defaults, supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers.
demand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve. as economic activity slows, credit markets tighten, or sovereign debt concerns linger, companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending, which could result in decreased demand for our products.
our ability to access the credit markets and the costs of borrowing are affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions. if our access to credit, including the commercial paper market, is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise, our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced.
we sell to customers around the world and are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries.
we do business in more than 80 countries around the world. approximately 45 percent of our sales in 2016 were to customers outside the u.s. in addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located in many places around the world. the future success of our business depends in large part on growth in our sales in non-u.s. markets. our global operations are subject to numerous financial, legal and operating risks, such as political and economic instability; prevalence of corruption in certain countries; enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and compliance with existing and future laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs, investments, taxation, trade controls, product content and performance, employment and repatriation of earnings. in addition, we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation rates and interest rates.
new legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business.
legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in these countries or may otherwise increase our costs to do business. for example, we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material, product, certification and labeling laws and regulations. our customers may also be required to comply with such legislative and regulatory requirements. these requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to ship our products into certain jurisdictions. changes in these requirements could impact demand for our products, solutions and services.
5
an inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products.
our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve. developing new products requires high levels of innovation, and the development process is often lengthy and costly. if we are not able to anticipate, identify, develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences, demand for our products could decline.
failures or security breaches of our products or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business.
we rely heavily on information technology (it) both in our products, solutions and services for customers and in our enterprise it infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives. government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers, cyber-criminals, malicious insiders and other actors targeting every type of it system including industrial control systems such as those we sell and service and corporate enterprise it systems. these actors may engage in fraud, theft of confidential or proprietary information and sabotage.
our products, solutions and services are used by our direct and indirect customers in applications that may be subject to information theft, tampering or sabotage.  among other industries, our products, solutions and services are often employed in the control of critical infrastructure.  careless or malicious actors could cause a customer's process to be disrupted or could cause equipment to operate in an improper manner that could result in harm to people or property. while we continue to improve the security attributes of our products, solutions and services, we can reduce risk, not eliminate it.  to a significant extent, the security of our customers' systems depends on how those systems are protected, configured, updated and monitored, all of which are typically outside our control.
our business uses development, engineering, manufacturing, sales, accounting, support and it resources on a dispersed, global basis.  our vendors, partners, employees and customers have access to, and share, information across multiple locations via various digital technologies.  in addition, we rely on partners and vendors for a wide range of outsourced activities.  secure connectivity is important to these ongoing operations. also, our partners and vendors frequently have access to our confidential information as well as confidential information about our customers, employees and others.
our information security efforts, under the leadership of our chief information security officer, with the support of the entire management team, include major programs designed to address security governance, identification of critical assets, protection of critical assets, the human element/insider risk, third-party relationships and cyber defense operations. we believe these measures reduce, but cannot eliminate, the risk of an information security incident.
any significant security incidents could have an adverse impact on sales, harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns.
there are inherent risks in our solutions and services businesses.
risks inherent in the sale of solutions and services include assuming greater responsibility for successfully delivering projects that meet a particular customer specification, including defining and controlling contract scope, efficiently executing projects and managing the performance and quality of our subcontractors and suppliers. if we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks, we could incur cost overruns, liabilities and other losses that would adversely affect our results of operations.
our industry is highly competitive.
we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects. we compete based on breadth and scope of our product portfolio and solution and service offerings, technology differentiation, the domain expertise of our employees and partners, product performance, quality of our products, solutions and services, knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers' business challenges, pricing, delivery and customer service. the relative importance of these factors differs across the markets and product areas that we serve. we seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels by continually developing advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers' business problems. in addition, we continue to drive productivity to reduce our cost structure. if we fail to achieve our objectives, to keep pace with technological changes or to provide high quality products, solutions and services, we may lose business or experience price erosion and correspondingly lower sales and margins. we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.
6
we face the potential harms of natural disasters, pandemics, acts of war, terrorism, international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations.
our business depends on the movement of people and goods around the world. natural disasters, pandemics, acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations, our suppliers or our customers, and could create economic instability. although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could decrease demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products.
intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers.
others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers. we frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties. indemnification payments and legal expenses to defend claims could be costly.
in addition, we own the rights to many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are important to our business. the inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant.
claims from taxing authorities could have an adverse effect on our income tax expense and financial position.
we conduct business in many countries, which requires us to interpret and comply with the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the uncertainty of how underlying facts may be construed, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. we must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.
our business success depends on attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel.
our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees. their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance. difficulty attracting and retaining members of our management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
increasing employee benefit costs could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.
one important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and health care benefits. the expenses we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit pension plans depend on factors such as changes in market interest rates, the value of plan assets, mortality assumptions and health care trend rates. significant unfavorable changes in these factors would increase our expenses. expenses related to employer-funded health care benefits depend on health care cost inflation. an inability to control costs related to employee and retiree benefits could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.
potential liabilities and costs from litigation (including asbestos claims and environmental remediation) could reduce our profitability.
various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to the safety and security of the products, solutions and services we sell, employment, contract matters and environmental remediation.
we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago. our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities, which could result in product liability claims. the uncertainties of litigation (including asbestos claims) and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution.
7
our operations are subject to various environmental regulations that are concerned with human health, the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air, ground and waters, the quality of air and bodies of water, and the handling, use and disposal of specified substances. our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties, waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals, as well as properties that we currently own and use, regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners. we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future, and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant.
we have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. in connection with these divestitures, certain lawsuits, claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses, either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law. in some instances, the divested business has assumed the liabilities; however, it is possible that we might be responsible for satisfying those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so.
a disruption to our distribution channel could reduce our sales.
in the united states and canada, approximately 90 percent of our sales are through distributors. in certain other countries, the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors. while we maintain the right to appoint new distributors, any unplanned disruption to our existing distribution channel could adversely affect our sales. a disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor, financial instability of a distributor or other events.
we rely on suppliers to provide equipment, components and services.
our business requires that we buy equipment, components and services including finished products, electronic components and commodities such as copper, aluminum and steel. our reliance on suppliers involves certain risks, including:
•   poor quality or an insecure supply chain, which could adversely affect the reliability and reputation of our products;
•   changes in the cost of these purchases due to inflation, exchange rates, commodity market volatility or other factors;
•   intellectual property risks such as ownership of rights or alleged infringement by suppliers;
•   information security risks associated with providing confidential information to suppliers; and
•   shortages of components, commodities or other materials, which could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies and ability to make timely delivery.
any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete. we also maintain several single-source supplier relationships, because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity or price considerations. unavailability or delivery delays of single-source components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner. the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products. even where substitute sources of supply are available, qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of sales.
risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us.
we have acquired, and will continue to acquire, businesses in an effort to enhance shareowner value. acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties, including:
•   difficulties in integrating the acquired business, retaining the acquired business' customers and achieving the expected benefits of the acquisition, such as sales increases, access to technologies, cost savings and increases in geographic or product presence, in the desired time frames;
•   loss of key employees of the acquired business;
•   legal and compliance issues;
•   difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems; and
•   diversion of management's attention from other business concerns.
future acquisitions could result in debt, dilution, liabilities, increased interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets.

our customers face the challenge of remaining globally cost competitive and automation can help them achieve their productivity and sustainability objectives. our value proposition is to help our customers reduce time to market, lower total cost of ownership, improve asset utilization and manage enterprise risks.
differentiation through technology innovation and domain expertise we seek a technology leadership position in industrial automation. we believe that our three platforms - integrated architecture, intelligent motor control and solutions and services - provide the foundation for a long-term sustainable competitive advantage.
our integrated control and information architecture, with logix at its core, is an important differentiator. we are the only automation provider that can support discrete, process, batch, safety, motion and power control on the same hardware platform with the same software programming environment. our integrated architecture is scalable with standard open communications protocols making it easier for customers to implement it more cost effectively.
intelligent motor control is one of our core competencies and an important aspect of an automation system. these products and solutions enhance the availability, efficiency and safe operation of our customers' critical and most energy-intensive plant assets. our intelligent motor control offering can be integrated seamlessly with the logix architecture.
domain expertise refers to the industry and application knowledge required to deliver solutions and services that support customers through the entire life cycle of their automation investment. the combination of industry-specific domain expertise of our people with our innovative technologies enables us to help our customers solve their manufacturing and business challenges.
global expansion as the manufacturing world continues to expand, we must be able to meet our customers' needs around the world. approximately 60 percent of our employees and 45 percent of our sales are outside the u.s. we continue to expand our footprint in emerging markets.
as we expand in markets with considerable growth potential and shift our global footprint, we expect to continue to broaden the portfolio of products, solutions and services that we provide to our customers in these regions. we have made significant investments to globalize our manufacturing, product development and customer-facing resources in order to be closer to our customers throughout the world. the emerging markets of asia pacific, including china and india, latin america, central and eastern europe and africa are projected to be the fastest growing over the long term, due to higher levels of infrastructure investment and the growing middle-class population. we believe that increased demand for consumer products in these markets will lead to manufacturing investment and provide us with additional growth opportunities in the future.
enhanced market access over the past decade, our investments in technology and globalization have enabled us to expand our addressed market to over $90 billion. our process initiative has been the most important contributor to this expansion and remains our largest growth opportunity. logix is the technology foundation that enabled us to become an industry leader for process applications. we complement that with a growing global network of engineers and partners to provide solutions to process customers.
oems represent another area of addressed market expansion and an important growth opportunity. to remain competitive, oems need to find the optimal balance of machine cost and performance while reducing their time to market. our scalable integrated architecture and intelligent motor control offerings, along with design productivity tools and our motion and safety products, can assist oems in addressing these business needs.
we have developed a powerful network of channel partners, technology partners and commercial partners that act as amplifiers to our internal capabilities and enable us to serve our customers' needs around the world.

u. s. industrial economic trends in 2016, sales in the u.s. accounted for 55 percent of our total sales. the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served u.s. markets include:
•   the industrial production (ip) index, published by the federal reserve, which measures the real output of manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities. the ip index is expressed as a percentage of real output in a base year, currently 2012. historically there has been a meaningful correlation between the changes in the ip index and the level of automation investment made by our u.s. customers in their manufacturing base.
•   the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (pmi), published by the institute for supply management (ism), which indicates the current and near-term state of manufacturing activity in the u.s. according to the ism, a pmi measure above 50 indicates that the u.s. manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below 50 indicates that it is generally contracting.
•   industrial equipment spending, compiled by the bureau of economic analysis, which provides insight into spending trends in the broad u.s. industrial economy. this measure over the longer term has proven to demonstrate a reasonable correlation with our domestic growth.
•   capacity utilization (total industry), published by the federal reserve, which measures plant operating activity. historically there has been a meaningful correlation between capacity utilization and levels of u.s. ip.
the table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2014 to 2016. all macroeconomic indicators improved in the most recent quarter except for pmi, indicating a recovery in the industrial economy. although pmi declined in september, the reading of 51.5 indicates that the manufacturing sector is continuing to expand.

non-u.s. economic trends in 2016, sales outside the u.s. accounted for 45 percent of our total sales. these customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with expanding global presence. in addition to the global factors previously mentioned in the "overview" section, international demand, particularly in emerging markets, has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region, investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets. we use changes in the respective countries' gross domestic product and ip as indicators of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business.
economic projections call for a higher rate of industrial production growth in all regions in 2017 except for europe, the middle east and africa (emea). current economic projections indicate stable conditions in europe as we proceed into 2017 but with some uncertainty associated with the ultimate resolution of the united kingdom's decision to exit the european union. in asia pacific, china's economic growth continues to be impacted by elevated debt levels, although industrial output and new orders growth have shown recent improvement; the indian economy remains one of the fastest growing globally. in latin america, brazil remains in recession but with an improved outlook, and mexico's economy continues to be stable. canada's outlook has also improved, as investment in resource-based industries may have reached a bottom.

summary of results of operations in 2016, sales were $5,879.5 million, a decrease of 6.8 percent year over year. organic sales decreased 3.9 percent, and currency translation reduced sales by 3.0 percentage points. growth in consumer and automotive industries was more than offset by declines in heavy industries, particularly oil and gas and mining.
the following is a summary of our results related to key growth initiatives:
•   sales related to our process initiative decreased 19 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. excluding the impact of currency translation, process initiative sales decreased 16 percent year over year.
•   logix sales decreased 7 percent year over year compared to 2015. logix organic sales decreased 4 percent.

(1)   see note 15 in the financial statements for the definition of segment operating earnings.
(2)   total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin are non-gaap financial measures. we exclude purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, general corporate - net, non-operating pension costs, interest expense and income tax provision because we do not consider these costs to be directly related to the operating performance of our segments. we believe that these measures are useful to investors as measures of operating performance. we use these measures to monitor and evaluate the profitability of our operating segments. our measures of total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin may be different from measures used by other companies.
(3)   adjusted eps is a non-gaap earnings measure that excludes the non-operating pension costs and their related income tax effects. see adjusted income, adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate reconciliation for more information on this non-gaap measure.

purchase accounting depreciation and amortization and non-operating pension costs are not allocated to our operating segments because these costs are excluded from our measurement of each segment's operating performance for internal purposes. if we were to allocate these costs, we would attribute them to each of our segments as follows (in millions):

the increases in non-operating pension costs in both segments in fiscal 2016 were primarily due to our adoption of the new mortality table (rp-2014) and mortality improvement scale (mp-2014) used to measure net periodic pension cost for our u.s. pension plans.
adjusted income, adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate reconciliation adjusted income, adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate are non-gaap earnings measures that exclude non-operating pension costs and their related income tax effects. non-operating pension costs include defined benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impact of any plan curtailments or settlements. these components of net periodic pension cost primarily relate to changes in pension assets and liabilities that are a result of market performance; we consider these costs to be unrelated to the operating performance of our business. we believe that adjusted income, adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period. adjusted eps is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation. our measures of adjusted income, adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate may be different from measures used by other companies. these non-gaap measures should not be considered a substitute for income from continuing operations, diluted eps and effective tax rate.

•   sales in the united states declined year over year, mainly due to weakness in heavy industries, particularly oil and gas.
•   sales in canada decreased due to the unfavorable impact of currency translation as well as declines in heavy industries, particularly oil and gas.
•   emea sales decreased due to the unfavorable impact of currency translation. organic sales increased in both mature europe and emerging countries.
•   asia pacific sales declined due to the unfavorable impact of currency translation as well as a decrease in organic sales in china.
•   latin america sales decreased due to the unfavorable impact of currency translation. organic sales growth in the region was led by mexico.
general corporate - net general corporate - net expenses were $79.7 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $85.6 million in fiscal 2015.
income before income taxes income before income taxes decreased 16 percent from $1,127.5 million in 2015 to $943.1 million in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in segment operating earnings. total segment operating earnings decreased 13 percent year over year from $1,360.5 million in 2015 to $1,188.7 million in 2016, primarily due to lower organic sales and unfavorable currency effects.

•   sales in the united states increased modestly, with strength in the consumer and automotive industries offset by weakness in heavy industries, especially the oil and gas industry.
•   sales in canada declined due to the unfavorable impact of currency translation as well as declines in resource-based industries, particularly the oil and gas industry.
•   emea sales decreased due to the unfavorable impact of currency translation. organic sales growth was led by emerging countries with modest growth in mature europe.
•   asia pacific sales declined due to the unfavorable impact of currency translation as well as a decrease in organic sales in china, partially offset by growth in india.
•   latin america sales decreased due to the unfavorable impact of currency translation. organic sales growth in the region was primarily driven by strong sales growth in mexico.

income before income taxes income before income taxes decreased 1 percent from $1,134.2 million in 2014 to $1,127.5 million in 2015, primarily due to increases in non-operating pension costs, general corporate - net expenses and interest expense, partially offset by an increase in segment operating earnings. total segment operating earnings increased 1 percent year over year, primarily due to strong productivity and higher organic sales, partially offset by unfavorable currency effects and higher spending.
income taxes the effective tax rate for 2015 was 26.6 percent compared to 27.1 percent in 2014. the adjusted effective tax rate in 2015 was 27.0 percent compared to 27.5 percent in 2014. the decreases in the effective tax rate and the adjusted effective tax rate were primarily due to the tax effect of foreign dividends and the retroactive extension of the u.s. research tax credit for calendar year 2014 during the first quarter of fiscal 2015, partially offset by a difference in the mix of pre-tax income across regions.

the following table summarizes free cash flow (in millions), which is a non-gaap financial measure:

our definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain our businesses and execute our strategy. cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back non-cash depreciation expense to earnings but does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures. our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations. operating, investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows. accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (u.s. gaap) require the excess income tax benefit from share-based compensation to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. we have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows. in our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance, including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation. our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.
cash provided by operating activities was $947.3 million for the year ended september 30, 2016 compared to $1,187.7 million for the year ended september 30, 2015. free cash flow was $833.7 million for the year ended september 30, 2016 compared to $1,077.2 million for the year ended september 30, 2015. the year-over-year decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities and free cash flow was primarily due to lower pre-tax income and less favorable working capital performance in 2016 compared to 2015.
we repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in 2016 at a total cost of $500.2 million. in 2015, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a total cost of $606.2 million. at september 30, 2016 and 2015 there were $5.3 million and $12.5 million, respectively, of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable that did not settle until the next fiscal year. our decision to repurchase shares in 2017 will depend on business conditions, free cash flow generation, other cash requirements and stock price. on april 6, 2016, the board of directors authorized us to expend an additional $1.0 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock. at september 30, 2016 we had approximately $945.0 million remaining for share repurchases under our existing board authorization. see part ii, item 5. market for the company's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities, for additional information regarding share repurchases.

we expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements, capital expenditures, additional contributions to our retirement plans, acquisitions of businesses, dividends to shareowners, repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt. we expect capital expenditures in 2017 to be about $150 million. we expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances and short-term investments, cash generated by operating activities, commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities.
given our extensive international operations, significant amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (funds) are held by non-u.s. subsidiaries where our undistributed earnings are indefinitely reinvested. generally, these funds would be subject to u.s. tax if repatriated. as of september 30, 2016, approximately 95 percent of our funds were held by these non-u.s. subsidiaries. the percentage of these funds held by non-u.s. subsidiaries can vary from quarter to quarter with an average of approximately 90 percent over the past eight quarters. we have not encountered and do not expect to encounter any difficulty meeting the liquidity requirements of our domestic and international operations.
in addition to cash generated by operating activities, we have access to existing financing sources, including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks. our short-term debt obligations are primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings. commercial paper borrowings outstanding were $448.6 million at september 30, 2016, with a weighted average interest rate of 0.57 percent and weighted average maturity period of 35 days. there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september 30, 2015. our debt-to-total-capital ratio was 49.7 percent at september 30, 2016 and 39.9 percent at september 30, 2015.
at september 30, 2016 and 2015, our total current borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in march 2020 was $1.0 billion. we can increase the aggregate amount of this credit facility by up to $350.0 million, subject to the consent of the banks in the credit facility. we have not borrowed against this credit facility during the years ended september 30, 2016 or 2015. separate short-term unsecured credit facilities of approximately $121.2 million at september 30, 2016 were available to non-u.s. subsidiaries. borrowings under our non-u.s. credit facilities at september 30, 2016 and september 30, 2015 were not significant. we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities at september 30, 2016 and september 30, 2015. additional information related to our credit facilities is included in note 5 in the financial statements.
among other uses, we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the short-term credit ratings set forth in the table below. under our current policy with respect to these ratings, we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility, if any, to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures.
the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30, 2016:
credit rating agency    short term rating   long term rating   outlook standard &amp; poor's   a-1                 a                  stable moody's                 p-2                 a3                 stable fitch ratings           f1                  a                  stable our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and market conditions. we have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date. if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide short-term funding. in such event, the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings.
we regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.
28
we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks. we enter into these contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain third-party and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years. we also use these contracts to hedge portions of our net investments in certain non-u.s. subsidiaries against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the u.s. dollar. in addition, we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans or other transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our entities' functional currencies. our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. we diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
from 1975 to 1989, rockwell international corporation (ric) operated the rocky flats facility in colorado for the u.s. department of energy (doe). in 1990, a class of landowners near rocky flats sued ric and dow chemical, another former operator of the facility. in may 2016, the parties agreed to settle this case and the doe authorized the settlement. under the settlement agreement, which is subject to court approval, we and dow chemical will pay $375.0 million in the aggregate to resolve the claims. we expect to be fully reimbursed by the doe for our obligation of $243.75 million under the settlement, either before or after we pay the amounts due. we expect to pay up to $242.5 million within the next 12 months. we will promptly pursue reimbursement from the doe; however, it is uncertain whether the government indemnification and reimbursement process will be completed by the time payment is due. given our cash and credit resources, we do not believe that the matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. refer to note 17 in the financial statements for further discussion of the rocky flats settlement.
cash dividends to shareowners were $378.2 million in 2016 ($2.90 per common share), $350.1 million in 2015 ($2.60 per common share) and $320.5 million in 2014 ($2.32 per common share). our quarterly dividend rate as of september 30, 2016 is $0.725 per common share ($2.90 per common share annually), which is determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors.

(b)   our postretirement benefit plans are unfunded and are subject to change. amounts reported are estimates of future benefit payments, to the extent estimable.
(c)   amounts reported for pension funding contributions reflect current estimates of known commitments. contributions to our pension plans beyond 2017 will depend on future investment performance of our pension plan assets, changes in discount rate assumptions and governmental regulations in effect at the time. amounts subsequent to 2017 are excluded from the summary above, as these amounts cannot be estimated with certainty. the minimum contribution for our u.s. pension plan as required by the employee retirement income security act (erisa) is currently zero. we may make additional contributions to this plan at the discretion of management.

(d)   this item includes contractual commitments for capital expenditures, certain materials purchases and long-term obligations under agreements with various service providers.
(e)   other long-term liabilities include environmental remediation costs, conditional asset retirement obligations and indemnification liabilities, net of related receivables. amounts subsequent to 2017 are excluded from the summary above, as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when the liabilities will be paid.
(f)   amount for unrecognized tax benefits includes accrued interest and penalties. we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits will be settled or paid.
(g)   refer to note 17 in the financial statements for discussion of the rocky flats settlement.

supplemental sales information we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period. therefore, changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales. sales by acquired businesses also affect our reported sales. we believe that organic sales, defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions, which is a non-gaap financial measure, provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance. we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period's sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. when we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.

critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. actual results could differ from those estimates. we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management.
retirement benefits - pension pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts, including the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, the assumed annual compensation increase rate, the retirement rate, the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate. changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods.
our global pension expense in 2016 was $161.3 million compared to $145.7 million in 2015. approximately 77 percent of our 2016 global pension expense relates to our u.s. pension plan. the actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2016 u.s. pension expense included the following: discount rate of 4.55 percent (compared to 4.50 percent for 2015); expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.50 percent (compared to 7.50 percent for 2015); and an assumed long-term compensation increase rate of 3.75 percent (compared to 3.75 percent for 2015).
in 2016, 2015 and 2014, we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our u.s. pension plans.
the table below presents our estimate of net periodic benefit cost in 2017 compared to net periodic benefit cost in 2016 (in millions):

net periodic benefit cost                   $174.0              $161.3             $12.7
for 2017 our u.s. discount rate will decrease to 3.75 percent from 4.55 percent in 2016. the discount rate was set as of our september 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans. for 2017 our u.s. long-term compensation increase rate will decrease to 3.50 percent from 3.75 percent in 2016. we established this rate by analyzing all elements of compensation that are pension-eligible earnings.
for 2017 our expected rate of return on u.s. plan assets will remain 7.50 percent. in estimating the expected return on plan assets, we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term, adjusted for forward-looking considerations, such as inflation, interest rates, equity performance and the active management of the plan's invested assets. we also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption. the financial markets produced positive returns in 2016. the plan's debt securities return was positive and above the expected return range in 2016, as lower market interest rates resulted in a strong performance from bonds. the plan's equity securities return was above the expected return range in 2016, as u.s. and international equity returns were positive for the year. the actual return for our portfolio of u.s. plan assets was approximately 7.60 percent annualized for the 15 years ended september 30, 2016, and was approximately 8.30 percent annualized for the 20 years ended september 30, 2016.

the target allocations and ranges of long-term expected return for our major categories of u.s. plan assets are as follows:
asset category      target allocations         expected return equity securities                  55%      9%   -         10%
debt securities                    40%      4%   -          6%
other                               5%      6%   -         11%
the changes in our discount rate and return on plan assets have an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost. the change in our discount rate also has an inverse relationship with our projected benefit obligation. the change in our compensation increase rate has a direct relationship with our net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation.
the following chart illustrates the estimated change in projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key assumptions for our u.s. pension plans (in millions):

more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note 11 in the financial statements.
revenue recognition for approximately 85 percent of our consolidated sales, we record sales when all of the following have occurred: persuasive evidence of a sales agreement exists; pricing is fixed or determinable; collection is reasonably assured; and products have been delivered and acceptance has occurred, as may be required according to contract terms, or services have been rendered. we recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as construction-type contracts using either the percentage-of-completion or completed contract methods of accounting. we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable; we use the completed contract method for all others. more information regarding our revenue recognition policies is contained in note 1 in the financial statements.
returns, rebates and incentives our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product. we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account credits or additional products, solutions and services based on meeting specified program criteria. certain distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to contractual limitations.
we record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience. adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns, rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual. a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed. if the time period were to change by 10 percent, the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately $7.9 million.
returns, rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits. rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products, solutions and services to be provided. accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or, where a right of setoff exists, as a reduction of accounts receivable. the accrual for customer returns, rebates and incentives was $184.4 million at september 30, 2016 and $181.4 million at september 30, 2015, of which $7.9 million at september 30, 2016 and $9.2 million at september 30, 2015 was included as an offset to accounts receivable.
34
litigation, claims and contingencies we record liabilities for litigation, claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate its value. we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures. the liabilities include expenses for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and third party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party. at third-party environmental sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site, as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. if we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable and a right of setoff exists, we record the liability net of the estimated recovery. if we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable, but a right of setoff does not exist, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation and a receivable for the estimated recovery. at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation. ongoing operating and maintenance expenditures included in our environmental remediation obligations are discounted to present value over the probable future remediation period. our remaining environmental remediation obligations are undiscounted due to subjectivity of timing and/or amount of future cash payments. environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup. to the extent that the required remediation procedures or timing of those procedures change, additional contamination is identified, or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected, the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change.
our accrual for environmental matters, including environmental indemnification liabilities, was $68.7 million, net of $22.2 million of related receivables, and $61.1 million, net of $32.9 million of related receivables, at september 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us (legacy businesses) for which we retained the responsibility to remediate. the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low. as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters, we expect that gradually, over a long period of time, our environmental obligations will decline. however, changes in required remediation procedures or timing of those procedures at existing legacy sites, or discovery of contamination at additional sites, could result in increases to our environmental obligations.
one of our principal self-insurance programs covers product liability where we self-insure up to a specified dollar amount. claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by insurance policies issued by commercial insurers. we estimate the reserve for product liability claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued. adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims. the reserve for product liability claims, including asbestos costs, was $20.1 million, net of $11.1 million of related receivables, and $17.8 million, net of $10.4 million of related receivables, as of september 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business. as described in note 14 in the financial statements within the section entitled other matters, we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago. see note 14 in the financial statements for further discussion.
we accrue for costs related to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal operation of the long-lived asset. the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional. identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities. we estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using site-specific knowledge and historical industry expertise. a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates. we recorded these liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, which totaled $0.7 million and $0.4 million in other current liabilities at september 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $19.9 million and $19.8 million in other liabilities at september 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

income taxes significant judgment is required in the determination of our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits.
deferred income taxes have been recorded for the temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider by jurisdiction all available positive and negative evidence, including our recent historical operating results, expected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, and tax-planning strategies. our assumptions about taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates of the underlying businesses. we record a valuation allowance if we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
we conduct business globally and are routinely audited by the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business. due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction, as well as inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments of taxes. we record unrecognized tax liabilities when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any appeals or litigation processes. we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available.
we have not provided u.s. deferred taxes for $3,274.0 million of undistributed earnings of certain non-u.s. subsidiaries, since these earnings have been determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. and thus are not subject to u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes that may be payable upon distribution of these earnings.

item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider all of the risks described below, as well as the other information contained in this document, when evaluating your investment in our securities.
risks relating to our business our business depends on the demand for our wireless infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for wireless connectivity, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for tenant additions or network services).
demand for our wireless infrastructure from our customers depends on the demand for wireless connectivity from their customers. the willingness of our customers to utilize our wireless infrastructure, or renew or extend existing leases on our wireless infrastructure, is affected by numerous factors, including:
•   consumer demand for wireless connectivity;
•   availability or capacity of our wireless infrastructure or associated land interests;
•   location of our wireless infrastructure;
•   financial condition of our customers, including their profitability and availability or cost of capital;
•   willingness of our customers to maintain or increase their network investment or changes in their capital allocation strategy;
•   availability and cost of spectrum for commercial use;
•   increased use of network sharing, roaming, joint development, or resale agreements by our customers;
•   mergers or consolidations by and among our customers;
•   changes in, or success of, our customers' business models;
•   governmental regulations, including local or state restrictions on the proliferation of wireless infrastructure;
•   cost of constructing wireless infrastructure;
•   our market competition;
•   technological changes, including those (1) affecting the number or type of wireless infrastructure needed to provide wireless connectivity to a given geographic area or which may otherwise serve as substitute or alternative to our wireless infrastructure or (2) resulting in the obsolescence or decommissioning of certain existing wireless networks; or
•   our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers' service requirements.
a slowdown in demand for wireless connectivity or our wireless infrastructure may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us. if our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans, as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise, they may reduce their spending, which could adversely affect our anticipated growth or the demand for our wireless infrastructure or network services.
the amount, timing, and mix of our customers' network investment is variable and can be significantly impacted by the various matters described in these risk factors. changes in carrier network investment typically impact the demand for our wireless infrastructure. as a result, changes in carrier plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems, new technologies (including small cells), or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure. furthermore, the wireless industry could experience a slowdown or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors, including a reduction in consumer demand for wireless connectivity or general economic conditions. there can be no assurances that weakness or uncertainty in the economic environment will not adversely impact the wireless industry, which may materially and adversely affect our business, including by reducing demand for our wireless infrastructure or network services. in addition, a slowdown may increase competition for site rental customers or network services. a wireless industry slowdown or a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business. for a further discussion of our risks relating to network services, see "-our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results" below.

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure and network services.
for 2016, our site rental revenues by customer were as follows:
the loss of any one of our large customers as a result of consolidation, merger, bankruptcy, insolvency, network sharing, roaming, joint development, resale agreements by our customers or otherwise may result in (1) a material decrease in our revenues, (2) uncollectible account receivables, (3) an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables, wireless infrastructure assets, intangible assets, or (4) other adverse effects to our business. we cannot guarantee that leases with our major customers will not be terminated or that these customers will renew their leases with us. in addition to our four largest customers, we also derive a portion of our revenues and anticipated future growth from new entrants offering or contemplating offering wireless services; such customers may be smaller or have less financial resources than our four largest customers, have business models which may not be successful, or may require additional capital. see also "item 1. business-the company" and note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
consolidation among our customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks, for example where they are co-residents on a tower, which may result in the termination or non-renewal of tenant leases and impact revenues from our wireless infrastructure. we expect that any termination of tenant leases as a result of this potential consolidation would be spread over multiple years. such consolidation may result in a reduction in such customers' future network investment in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar. wireless carrier consolidation could decrease the demand for our wireless infrastructure, which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues or cash flows.
in recent years, at&t, t-mobile and sprint acquired leap wireless, metropcs, and clearwire, respectively. during 2017, we expect site rental revenues to be impacted by non-renewals of $50 million to $60 million as a result of the decommissioning of the acquired networks. the acquired networks represented approximately 9% of our net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016. we currently expect potential non-renewals from the decommissioning of the acquired networks to be approximately 60% of current run-rate site rental revenues related to the acquired networks, with the majority of such non-renewals to occur through the end of 2018. depending on the eventual network deployment and decommissioning plans of at&t, t-mobile and sprint, the impact and timing of such non-renewals may vary from our expectations.
see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental cash payments due to us by tenants pursuant to tenant agreements without consideration of tenant renewal options.
the business model for small cells contains certain differences from our traditional site rental business, resulting in different operational risks. if we do not successfully operate that business model or identify or manage those operational risks, such operations may produce results that are less than anticipated.
the business model for our small cells operations contains certain differences from our traditional towers operations, including differences relating to customer contract terms, landlord demographics, ownership of certain network assets, operational oversight requirements (including requirements for service level agreements regarding network performance and maintenance), growth rates, and applicable laws. while our small cells operations have certain risks that are similar to our towers operations, they also have certain operational risks that are different from our traditional site rental business, including the (1) use of competitive local
8
exchange carrier, which we refer to as clec status, (2) use of public rights-of-ways and franchise agreements, (3) use of poles owned solely by, or jointly with, third parties, (4) risks relating to overbuilding, (5) risks relating to construction management, (6) risks relating to network data security or (7) potential damage to our overall reputation as a wireless infrastructure provider. we cannot be certain that we will be successful in maintaining right-of-way agreements, obtaining future agreements on acceptable terms, or that our clec status will be recognized. in addition, the rate at which wireless carriers adopt or prioritize small cells may be lower or slower than we anticipate or may cease to exist altogether. our small cells operations will also expose us to different safety or liability risks or hazards than our traditional site rental business as a result of numerous factors, including the location or nature of the assets involved. there may be risks and challenges associated with small cells being comparatively new technologies and continuing to evolve, and there may be other risks related to small cells of which we are not yet aware.
our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. in addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated.
as a result of our substantial indebtedness:
•   we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic or industry conditions;
•   we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund discretionary investments or other general corporate requirements or to refinance our existing indebtedness;
•   we are or will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal or interest on our debt, thereby reducing the available cash flows to fund other projects, including the discretionary investments discussed in "item 1. business";
•   we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry;
•   we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry with less debt;
•   we may be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates;
•   we may be adversely impacted by changes to credit ratings related to our debt instruments;
•   we may be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity or sell some of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet payment obligations;
•   we may be limited in our ability to take advantage of strategic business opportunities, including wireless infrastructure development or mergers and acquisitions; or
•   we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit as a result of limitations on our ability to declare and pay dividends to stockholders as a result of restrictive covenants in our debt instruments.
currently we have debt instruments in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, sell assets, or engage in certain mergers and acquisitions, among other things. in addition, the credit agreement governing our senior unsecured credit facility agreement ("2016 credit facility") contains financial maintenance covenants. our ability to comply with these covenants or to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance. if we violate the restrictions in our debt instruments or fail to comply with our financial maintenance covenants, we will be in default under those instruments, which in some cases would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our long-term indebtedness to be accelerated. furthermore, if the limits on our ability to pay dividends prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on our undistributed taxable income. if our operating subsidiaries were to default on their debt, the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing such debt, in which case we could lose the wireless infrastructure and the revenues associated with the wireless infrastructure. see "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources-debt covenants" for a further discussion of our debt covenants.
ccic is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries. accordingly, ccic's sources of cash to pay interest or principal on its outstanding indebtedness are distributions relating to its respective ownership interests in its subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings. earnings and cash flows generated by ccic's subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries to conduct their operations, including servicing their respective debt obligations, after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to such holding company, in the absence of any special conditions such as a continuing event of default. however, ccic's subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding company and, unless they guarantee such debt, have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment.

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness. in the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness (approximately $13.2 billion as of february 15, 2017), which, upon final maturity, we will need to refinance or repay. see "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources" for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities. there can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness (1) on commercially reasonable terms, (2) on terms, including with respect to interest rates, as favorable as our current debt, or (3) at all.
economic conditions and the credit markets have historically experienced, and may continue to experience, periods of volatility, uncertainty, or weakness that could impact the availability or cost of debt financing, including any refinancing of the obligations described above or on our ability to draw the full amount of our $2.5 billion 2016 revolver, that, as of february 15, 2017, has $2.4 billion of undrawn availability.
if we are unable to repay or refinance our debt, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt, fund our planned capital expenditures or pay future dividends. in such an event, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations. failure to repay or refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness. if we incur additional indebtedness, any such indebtedness could exacerbate the risks described above.
sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures, finance acquisitions or repay debt. our business strategy contemplates access to external financing to fund certain discretionary investments, which may include issuances of common stock or other equity related securities. in august 2015, we established an "at-the-market" stock offering program ("atm program") through which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $500.0 million to or through sales agents. as of february 15, 2017, we had approximately $173 million of gross sales of common stock remaining on our atm program. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. as of february 15, 2017, we had 361 million shares of common stock outstanding.
we have reserved 12.0 million shares of common stock for issuance in connection with awards granted under our various stock compensation plans.
further, a small number of common stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. if any one of these common stockholders, or any group of our common stockholders, sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock, or the public market perceives that existing common stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock may significantly decline.
as a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable rental rates on our new or renewing tenant leases.
our growth is dependent on our entering into new tenant leases (including amendments to leases upon modification of an existing installation), as well as renewing or renegotiating tenant leases when existing tenant leases terminate. competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new customers, maintain or increase our gross margins, or maintain or increase our market share. we face competition for site rental tenants and associated rental rates from various sources, including (1) other independent wireless infrastructure owners or operators, including those that own, operate, or manage towers, rooftops, broadcast towers, utility poles, fiber (including non-traditional competitors such as cable providers) or small cells, or (2) new alternative deployment methods in the wireless industry.
our small cell operations may have different competitors than our traditional site rental business, including other owners of fiber, as well as new entrants into small cells, some of which may have larger networks or greater financial resources than we have.
new technologies may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.
improvements in the efficiency, architecture, and design of wireless networks may reduce the demand for our wireless infrastructure. for example, new technologies that may promote network sharing, joint development, wireless backhaul, or resale agreements by our customers, such as signal combining technologies or network functions virtualization, may reduce the need for our wireless infrastructure. in addition, other technologies, such as wifi, distributed antenna systems ("das"), femtocells, other
10
small cells, or satellite (such as low earth orbiting) and mesh transmission systems may, in the future, serve as substitutes for, or alternatives to, leasing that might otherwise be anticipated or expected on wireless infrastructure had such technologies not existed. in addition, new technologies that enhance the range, efficiency, and capacity of wireless equipment could reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure. any significant reduction in demand for our wireless infrastructure resulting from the new technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us.
the expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results.
we seek to expand and develop our business, including through acquisitions (such as the fibernet acquisition), increased product offerings (such as small cells and fiber), or other strategic growth opportunities. in the ordinary course of our business, we review, analyze, and evaluate various potential transactions or other activities in which we may engage. such transactions or activities could cause disruptions in, increase risk or otherwise negatively impact our business. among other things, such transactions and activities may:
•   disrupt our business relationships with our customers, depending on the nature of or counterparty to such transactions and activities;
•   divert the time or attention of management away from other business operations, including as a result of post-transaction integration activities;
•   fail to achieve revenue or margin targets, operational synergies or other benefits contemplated;
•   increase operational risk or volatility in our business;
•   not result in the benefits management had expected to realize from such expansion and development activities;
•   impact our cost structure and result in the need to hire additional employees;
•   increase demands on current employees or result in current or prospective employees experiencing uncertainty about their future roles with us, which might adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key managers or other employees; or
•   result in the need for additional trss that are subject to federal and state corporate income taxes.
if we fail to retain rights to our wireless infrastructure, including the land interests under our towers, our business may be adversely affected.
the property interests on which our wireless infrastructure resides, including the land interests under our towers, consist of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses, and rights-of-way. a loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business or generate revenues. for various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze, or verify all information regarding titles or other issues prior to purchasing wireless infrastructure. further, we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms. our ability to retain rights to the land interests on which our towers reside depends on our ability to purchase such land, including fee interests and perpetual easements, or renegotiate or extend the terms of the leases relating to such land. approximately 11% of our towers site rental gross margins for the year ended december 31, 2016 was derived from towers where the leases for the interests under such towers had final expiration dates of less than ten years. if we are unable to retain rights to the property interests on which our wireless infrastructure resides, our business may be adversely affected.
as of december 31, 2016, approximately 53% of our towers were leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, or other agreements with at&t, sprint, and t-mobile. we have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms. we have no obligation to exercise such purchase options. we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase some or all of these towers at the time these options are exercisable. even if we do have available capital, we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase these towers or some or all of the t-mobile or at&t towers for business or other reasons. in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights, or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights, the benefits of the acquisition of these towers may not exceed the costs, which could adversely affect our business. additional information concerning these towers and the applicable purchase options as of december 31, 2016 is as follows:
•   approximately 22% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under a master prepaid lease or other related agreements with at&amp;t for a weighted-average initial term of approximately 28 years, weighted on site rental gross margin. we have the option to purchase the leased and subleased towers from at&amp;t at the end of the respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $4.2 billion, which payments, if exercised, would be due between 2032 and 2048.
11
•   approximately 16% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed for an initial period of 32 years (through may 2037) under master leases, subleases or other agreements with sprint. we have the option to purchase in 2037 all (but not less than all) of the leased and subleased sprint towers from sprint for approximately $2.3 billion.
•   approximately 15% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under a master prepaid lease or other related agreements with t-mobile for a weighted-average initial term of approximately 28 years, weighted on site rental gross margin. we have the option to purchase the leased and subleased towers from t-mobile at the end of the respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $2.0 billion, which payments, if exercised, would be due between 2035 and 2049. in addition, through the t-mobile acquisition, there are another approximately 1% of our towers subject to a lease and sublease or other related arrangements with at&amp;t. we have the option to purchase these towers that we do not otherwise already own at the end of their respective lease terms for aggregate option payments of up to approximately $405 million, which payments, if exercised, would be due between 2018 and 2032 (less than $10 million would be due before 2025).
under master lease or master prepaid lease arrangements we have with at&t, sprint and t-mobile, certain of our subsidiaries lease or sublease, or are otherwise granted the right to manage and operate, towers from bankruptcy remote subsidiaries of such carriers. if one of these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries should become a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and is permitted to reject the underlying ground lease, our subsidiaries could lose their interest in the applicable sites. if our subsidiaries were to lose their interest in the applicable sites or if the applicable ground leases were to be terminated, we would lose the cash flow derived from the towers on those sites, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. we have similar bankruptcy risks with respect to sites that we operate under management agreements.
our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.
the operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longer-term results for this activity. our network services business is generally driven by demand for our wireless infrastructure and may be adversely impacted by various factors, including:
•   competition;
•   the timing, mix and amount of customer network investments;
•   the rate and volume of customer deployment plans;
•   unforeseen delays or challenges relating to work performed;
•   economic weakness or uncertainty;
•   our market share; or
•   changes in the size, scope, or volume of work performed.
new wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected.
there can be no assurances that new wireless services or technologies will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless carriers. in addition, demand or customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons. as a result, growth opportunities or demand for our wireless infrastructure arising from such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated.
if we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.
a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business, including those discussed in "item 1. business." failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions. we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations, including federal, state, or local tax laws, will not adversely affect our business (including our reit status), increase delays or result in additional costs. these factors may have a material adverse effect on us.
if radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our wireless infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.
the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us.
public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular or other wireless connectivity services may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies, which may in turn slow or diminish our growth. in particular, negative public perception of,
12
and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless services. if a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects were established, our operations, costs, or revenues may be materially and adversely affected. we currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters.
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation ("charter"), amended and restated by-laws ("by-laws") and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.
we have a number of anti-takeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts or may reduce the market value of our common stock. our anti-takeover provisions include:
•   the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without approval of the holders of our common stock; and
•   advance notice requirements for director nominations or actions to be taken at annual meetings.
our by-laws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors, and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings. such provisions, as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, may impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
in addition, domestic or international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring wireless infrastructure in certain geographical areas or impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
we may be vulnerable to security breaches that could adversely affect our operations, business, and reputation.
despite existing security measures, certain of our wireless infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to unauthorized access, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, and other security breaches. an attack attempt or security breach, such as a distributed denial of service attack, could potentially result in (1) interruption or cessation of certain of our services to our customers, (2) our inability to meet expected levels of service, or (3) data transmitted over our customers' networks being compromised. we cannot guarantee that our security measures will not be circumvented, resulting in customer network failures or interruptions that could impact our customers' network availability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operational results. we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against or recover from such threats. if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, and we could lose customers. further, the perpetrators of cyber-attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. these attacks may be committed by our employees or external actors operating in any geography. any such events could result in legal claims or penalties, disruption in operations, misappropriation of sensitive data, damage to our reputation, negative market perception, or costly response measures, which could adversely affect our business.
risks relating to our reit status future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities.  in such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.
during each of the first three quarters of 2016, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.885 per share, totaling approximately $896.6 million. in october 2016, we increased our quarterly dividend, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, from an annual amount of $3.54 per share to an annual amount of $3.80 per share. as such, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.95 per share in october 2016, which represented an increase of 7% from the quarterly dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2016. we currently expect such dividends to result in aggregate annual cash payments of approximately $1.3 billion during the next 12 months. over time, we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows. future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors. see notes 12 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements.
we operate as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit, we will generally be required to distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available nols, (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year to our stockholders. our quarterly cash common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our nols and may cause certain of the nols to expire without utilization. see also
13
"item 7. md&a-general overview-common stock dividend" and "item 1. business-2016 industry highlights and company developments-reit status."
as discussed in "item 1. md&a-business-strategy," we seek to invest our capital, including the net cash provided by our operating activities as well as external financing sources, in a manner that we believe will increase long-term stockholder value on a risk-adjusted basis. our historical discretionary investments have included the following (in no particular order): purchasing our common stock, acquiring or constructing wireless infrastructure, acquiring land interests under towers, improving or structurally enhancing our existing wireless infrastructure, or purchasing, repaying or redeeming our debt. external financing, including debt, equity, and equity-related issuances to fund future discretionary investments either (1) may not be available to us or (2) may not be accessible by us at terms that would result in the investment of the net proceeds raised yielding incremental growth in our per share operating results. as a result, future dividend payments may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan.
remaining qualified to be taxed as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the us internal revenue code. failure to remain qualified as a reit would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, which would reduce our available cash.
we operate as a reit for u.s. federal tax purposes. as a reit, we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to u.s. federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our common stockholders.
while we intend to operate so that we remain qualified as a reit, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, and the potential impact of future changes to laws and regulations impacting reits, no assurance can be given that we will qualify as a reit for any particular year.
certain government officials, including members of the u.s. congress and executive branch, have called for substantial changes to fiscal and tax policies, which may include comprehensive tax reform. we cannot predict the impact, if any, that these changes, if enacted, might have on our business. however, it is possible that such changes could adversely affect our business, including our reit status.
if, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code, then:
•   we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income;
•   we will be subject to federal and state income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates; and
•   if such failure to qualify occurs after the effective date of our election to be taxed as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we would be disqualified from re-electing reit status for the four taxable years following the year during which we were so disqualified.
although we may have federal nols available to reduce any taxable income, to the extent our federal nols have been utilized or are otherwise unavailable, any such corporate tax liability could be substantial, would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes and might necessitate the borrowing of additional funds or the liquidation of some investments to pay any additional tax liability. accordingly, funds available for investment would be reduced.
under the code, for taxable years beginning before 2018, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss or other non-qualifying assets. for taxable years beginning in 2018, the limit on the value of assets of a reit that may be represented by securities of one or more trss or other non-qualifying assets will reduce to 20%. these current or future limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in non-reit qualifying operations or assets, or in any operations held through trss. the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement. however, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment. in particular, if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in our trss or certain other non-qualifying assets to exceed current or future limitations of the fair market value of our assets at the end of any quarter, then we may fail to remain qualified as a reit.
14
complying with reit requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.
to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit, we will generally be required to distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available nols (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year to our stockholders. we commenced declaring regular quarterly dividends to our common stockholders beginning with the first quarter of 2014. see notes 12 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements. any such dividends, however, are subject to the determination and approval of our board of directors based on then-current and anticipated future conditions, including our earnings, net cash provided by operating activities, capital requirements, financial condition, our relative market capitalization, our existing federal nols of approximately $1.3 billion, of which substantially all are available to offset reit taxable income, or other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.
to the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our reit taxable income (after the application of available nols, if any), we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the code.
from time to time, we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms, sell assets at disadvantageous prices, or distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the reit dividend requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. thus, compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. furthermore, the reit dividend requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth, or expansion initiatives, which would increase our total leverage.
in addition to satisfying the distribution test, to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes, we will need to continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the ownership of our capital stock. compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, or investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss, and to that extent, limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. furthermore, acquisition opportunities in domestic or international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to completing any such acquisition. in addition, our conversion to a reit may result in investor pressures not to pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive.
moreover, if we fail to comply with certain asset ownership tests, at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification. as a result, we may be required to liquidate assets in adverse market conditions or forgo otherwise attractive investments. these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.
reit related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock.
in order for us to continue to satisfy the requirements for reit qualification, our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year (other than the first year for which an election to be a reit has been made). also, not more than 50% of the value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer "individuals" (as defined in the code to include certain entities such as private foundations) during the last half of a taxable year (other than the first taxable year for which an election to be a reit has been made). in order to facilitate compliance with the reit rules, our charter includes provisions that implement reit-related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions that generally prohibit any person (as defined in our charter) from beneficially or constructively owning, or being deemed to beneficially or constructively own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code, more than 9.8%, by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our common stock, or 9.8% in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock. in addition, our charter provides for certain other ownership limitations and transfer restrictions. under applicable constructive ownership rules, any shares of capital stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limitations. these ownership limitations and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise might be in the best interest of our stockholders.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview overview we own, operate, and lease shared wireless infrastructure. see "item 1. business" for a further discussion of our business, including our long-term strategy, our reit status, certain key terms of our lease agreements, and growth trends in the wireless industry. site rental revenues represented 82% of our 2016 consolidated net revenues. the vast majority of our site rental revenues is of a recurring nature and has been contracted for in a prior year.
business fundamentals and results the following are certain highlights of our business fundamentals and results as of and for the year ended december 31, 2016:
•   we operate as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes (see "item 1. business-2016 industry highlights and company developments-reit election" and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements).
•   potential growth resulting from wireless network expansion and new entrants
◦   we expect wireless carriers will continue their focus on improving network quality and expanding capacity by adding additional antennas or other equipment on our wireless infrastructure.
◦   we expect existing and potential new customer demand for our wireless infrastructure will result from (1) new technologies, (2) increased usage of wireless applications (including mobile entertainment, mobile internet usage, and machine-to-machine applications), (3) adoption of other emerging and embedded wireless devices (including smartphones, laptops, tablets, and other devices), (4) increasing smartphone penetration, (5) wireless carrier focus on expanding both network quality and capacity, including the use of both towers and small cells, or (6) the availability of additional spectrum.
◦   new tenants additions are achieved at a low incremental operating cost, delivering high incremental returns.
•   substantially all of our wireless infrastructure can accommodate additional tenancy, either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications.
◦   u.s. wireless carriers continue to invest in their networks.
•   site rental revenues under long-term tenant leases with contractual escalations
◦   initial terms of five to 15 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant of five to ten years each.
◦   weighted-average remaining term of approximately six years, exclusive of renewals at the tenant's option, currently representing approximately $19 billion of expected future cash inflows.
•   revenues predominately from large wireless carriers
◦   approximately 90% of our site rental revenues were derived from at&amp;t, t-mobile, verizon, and sprint. see also "item 1a. risk factors" and note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
•   majority of land interests under our towers under long-term control
◦   nearly 90% of our towers site rental gross margin and more than 75% of our towers site rental gross margin is derived from towers that reside on land that we own or control for greater than ten and 20 years, respectively. the aforementioned amounts include towers that reside on land interests that are owned, including fee interests and perpetual easements, which represent in excess of one-third of our towers site rental gross margin.
•   minimal sustaining capital expenditure requirements
◦   sustaining capital expenditures represented approximately 2% of net revenues.
•   debt portfolio with long-dated maturities extended over multiple years, with the majority of such debt having a fixed rate (see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for a further discussion of our debt)
◦   after giving effect to our 2017 refinancings described below, 81% of our debt has fixed rate coupons.
◦   our debt service coverage and leverage ratios were comfortably within their respective financial maintenance covenants. see "item 7. md&amp;a-liquidity and capital resources-debt covenants" for a further discussion of our debt covenants.
◦   we completed several transactions that resulted in lowering our average cost of borrowing, including, refinancing certain of our debt and extending certain of our debt maturities. see "item 7. md&amp;a-liquidity and capital resources-financing activities" for further discussion of our debt transactions.
•   in january 2016, we completed a new senior unsecured credit facility ("2016 credit facility") and utilized the proceeds to repay the previously outstanding 2012 credit facility.
•   in february 2016, we issued 3.400% senior unsecured notes due february 2021 and 4.450% senior unsecured notes due february 2026 (collectively, "february 2016 senior notes"), in aggregate principal amounts of $600 million and $900 million, respectively.
24
•   in may 2016, we issued additional 3.400% senior unsecured notes due february 2021 and 3.700% senior unsecured notes due june 2026 (collectively, "may 2016 senior notes"), in aggregate principal amounts of $250 million and $750 million, respectively.
•   in september 2016, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 2.250% senior unsecured notes due september 2021 ("september 2016 senior notes").
•   in february 2017, we (1) issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.000% senior unsecured notes and utilized the net proceeds to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings on the 2016 credit facility and (2) entered into an amendment to the credit facility to incur additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million, and extend the maturity of both the 2016 term loan a and the 2016 revolver to january 21, 2022 (collectively, "2017 refinancings").
•   significant cash flows from operations
◦   net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion.
◦   we expect to grow our core business of providing access to our wireless infrastructure as a result of contractual escalators and future anticipated additional demand for our wireless infrastructure.
•   returning cash flows provided by operations to stockholders in the form of dividends (see also "item 1. business")
◦   during 2016, we paid common stock dividends totaling approximately $1.2 billion. see "item 7. md&amp;a-general overview-common stock dividend" for a discussion of the increase to our quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of 2016.
•   during 2016, we issued shares of our common stock in connection with the following transactions: (see "item 7. md&amp;a-liquidity and capital resources-financing activities" for further discussion)
◦   in march 2016, we sold 3.8 million shares under the atm program, and we utilized the proceeds to partially fund the tdc acquisition,
◦   in november 2016, our previously outstanding convertible preferred stock converted to common stock, and
◦   in november 2016, we issued approximately 11.4 million shares, and we utilized proceeds from such offering to partially fund the fibernet acquisition in january 2017.
•   investing capital efficiently to grow long-term dividends per share (see also "item 1. business")
◦   discretionary capital expenditures of $784.1 million, including wireless infrastructure improvements in order to support additional site rentals, construction of wireless infrastructure, and land purchases.
◦   see a discussion of the fibernet acquisition below.
change in operating segments during the first quarter of 2016, we changed our operating segments to consist of towers and small cells. this change was a result of growth in small cells from a combination of organic growth, capital expenditures, and acquisitions, as well as the continued progression of the integration of sunesys, which led to changes in how our chief operating decision maker ("codm") reviews financial information.
our operating segment change aligns with how the codm views and evaluates our operations, including how the codm allocates capital and assesses segment performance. we have recast our prior period presentation to conform to our current reporting presentation.
towers. our towers segment, which represented 88% of our revenues during 2016, provides access, including space or capacity, to our approximately 40,000 towers geographically dispersed throughout the u.s. our towers have a significant presence in the top 100 btas. the towers segment also reflects certain network services relating to our towers, consisting of site development services and installation services.
we acquired ownership interests or exclusive rights to the majority of our towers from the four largest wireless carriers (or their predecessors) through transactions consummated since 1999, including transactions with (1) at&t in 2013, (2) t-mobile in 2012, (3) global signal inc. in 2007, which had originally acquired the majority of its towers from sprint, (4) companies now part of verizon wireless during 1999 and 2000, and (5) companies now part of at&t during 1999 and 2000.
small cells. our small cells segment, which represented 12% of our revenues during 2016, provides access, including space or capacity, to our approximately 26,500 route miles of fiber (after giving effect to the fibernet acquisition) primarily supporting small cell networks. to a lesser extent, the small cells segment also offers fiber based solutions. our small cells assets include those acquired from nextg networks, inc. in 2012, sunesys in 2015, and fibernet in 2017. our customers in small cells generally are large wireless carriers and businesses with high bandwidth demands, such as enterprise, government, education and wholesale customers. see also "item 1. business."
25
common stock dividend in aggregate, we paid approximately $1.2 billion in common stock dividends in 2016. during each of the first three quarters of 2016, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.885 per share, totaling approximately $896.6 million. in october 2016, we increased our quarterly dividend, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, from an annual amount of $3.54 per share to an annual amount of $3.80 per share. as such, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.95 per share in october 2016, which represented an increase of 7% from the quarterly dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2016. we currently expect such dividends to result in aggregate annual cash payments of at least $1.3 billion during the next 12 months, or an annualized amount of $3.80 per share. over time, we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows. future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors. see notes 12 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements.
fibernet acquisition on november 1, 2016, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire fibernet for approximately $1.5 billion in cash, subject to certain limited adjustments. fibernet is a fiber services provider in florida and texas that owns or has rights to approximately 11,500 route miles of fiber installed and under construction, inclusive of approximately 6,000 route miles in top metro markets. we believe that the fibernet assets will further support demand for our wireless infrastructure. on january 17, 2017, we closed on the fibernet acquisition which was financed using proceeds from our november 2016 equity offering and borrowings under the 2016 revolver.
outlook highlights the following are certain highlights of our 2017 outlook that impact our business fundamentals described above.
•   we expect that our full year 2017 site rental revenue growth will be impacted by (1) a healthy environment for tenant additions, as large wireless carriers continue to upgrade and enhance their networks to meet the increasing need for wireless connectivity, (2) the fibernet acquisition (see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements), and (3) anticipated non-renewals of tenant leases, primarily resulting from from our customers' decommissioning of the acquired networks. see "item 1a. risk factors" for a further discussion of non-renewals. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.
•   we expect total capital expenditures for 2017 to equal or exceed 2016 levels with a continued increase in the construction of new small cells. we also expect sustaining capital expenditures of approximately 2% of net revenues for full year 2017.

2016 and 2015.
site rental revenues for 2016 grew approximately $214.9 million, or 7%, from 2015. this increase was predominately comprised of the factors depicted in the chart below:
(a)   includes (1) amortization of up front payments received from long-term tenant contracts and other deferred credits (commonly referred to as prepaid rent) and (2) the construction of small cells.
(b)   represents initial contribution of acquisitions and tower builds until the one-year anniversary of the acquisition or build.
towers site rental revenues for 2016 were approximately $2.8 billion and increased by approximately $96.7 million, or 4%, from approximately $2.7 billion during 2015. the increase in towers site rental revenues was impacted by the following items, inclusive of straight-line accounting, in no particular order: tenant additions across our entire portfolio, renewals or extensions of tenant leases, escalations, acquisitions (including the tdc acquisition in april 2016), and non-renewals of tenant leases predominately arising from our customers' decommissioning of the acquired networks. tenant additions were influenced by our customers' ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity.
small cells site rental revenues for 2016 were approximately $402.6 million and increased by approximately $118.2 million, or 42%, from approximately $284.4 million from 2015. the increase in small cells site rental revenues was predominately (1) impacted by the sunesys acquisition completed in august 2015 and (2) due to the leasing of newly constructed small cells. increased demand for small cells was influenced by our customers' growing adoption of small cells as an important component of their network strategy to provide capacity and relieve network congestion.
the increase in towers site rental gross margins from 2015 to 2016 was related to the previously mentioned 4% increase in towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers. the increase in small cells site rental gross margins was predominately related to the previously mentioned 42% increase in small cells site rental revenues.
towers network services and other gross margin was approximately $259.1 million for 2016 and decreased by approximately $23.5 million, or 8%, from approximately $282.6 million in 2015, which is a reflection of (1) the volume of activity from carrier network enhancements and (2) the volume and mix of network services and other work. our network services and other offerings are of a variable nature as these revenues are not under long-term contracts.
general and administrative expenses for 2016 were approximately $371.0 million and increased by approximately $60.1 million, or approximately 19%, from approximately $310.9 million during 2015. general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stock-based compensation charges, which increased approximately $29.4 million from 2015 to 2016. the increase in general
28
and administrative expenses was primarily related to the growth in our small cell business as a result of activities such as (1) the sunesys acquisition and (2) the continued expansion in size of our small cell portfolio.
towers operating profit for 2016 increased by approximately $59.1 million, or 3%, from 2015. towers operating profit was primarily impacted by the growth in our towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers.
small cells operating profit for 2016 increased by approximately $64.4 million, or 43%, from 2015. small cells operating profit was positively impacted by the previously mentioned sunesys acquisition and the leasing of newly constructed small cells.
adjusted ebitda increased approximately $108.3 million, or 5%, from 2015 to 2016. adjusted ebitda was (1) positively impacted by the growth in our site rental activities in both towers and small cells and (2) negatively impacted by a decrease in tower network services and other gross margin.
depreciation, amortization and accretion was approximately $1.1 billion for the 2016 and increased by approximately $72.4 million, or 7%, from approximately $1.0 billion during 2015. this increase predominately resulted from a corresponding increase in our gross property and equipment due to capital expenditures and acquisitions, including the sunesys acquisition.
interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs were approximately $515.0 million for 2016 and decreased by approximately $12.1 million, or 2%, from approximately $527.1 million during 2015. this decrease is predominately the result of a $18.7 million decrease in the amortization of interest rate swaps.
as a result of repaying certain of our debt, in conjunction with our refinancing activities, we incurred losses of approximately $52.3 million and approximately $4.2 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. for a further discussion of the debt refinancings, see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources" and "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
other income (expense) for 2016 was expenses of approximately $8.8 million, compared to income of approximately $57.0 million for 2015. this change was predominately a result of gains recorded during 2015 on foreign currency swaps that we entered into to manage and reduce our foreign currency risk related to our may 2015 sale of ccal. see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.
the benefit (provision) for income taxes for 2016 was a provision of approximately $16.9 million compared to a benefit of approximately $51.5 million for 2015. for 2016, the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate predominately due to our reit status, including the dividends paid deduction.  for 2015, the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to (1) our reit status, including the dividends paid deduction and (2) the de-recognition of net deferred tax liabilities related to the inclusion of small cells in the reit in january 2016, which resulted in a non-cash income tax benefit of approximately $33.8 million. see "item 7. md&a-accounting and reporting matters-critical accounting policies and estimates" and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
income from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased from 2015 to 2016 due to the sale of ccal occurring on may 28, 2015. in addition, during 2015, we recorded a gain on the sale of discontinued operations, net of tax, of approximately $1.0 billion.
net income (loss) attributable to ccic stockholders was income of approximately $357.0 million during 2016 compared to income of approximately $1.5 billion during 2015. the decrease in net income was predominately due to the gain recorded on the sale of ccal in 2015 of approximately $1.0 billion.
29
2015 and 2014.
site rental revenues for 2015 grew approximately $151.8 million, or 5%, from 2014. this increase was predominately comprised of the factors depicted in the chart below:
(a)   includes (1) amortization of up front payments received from long-term tenant contracts and other deferred credits (commonly referred to as prepaid rent) and (2) the construction of small cells.
(b)   represents initial contribution of acquisitions and tower builds until the one-year anniversary of the acquisition or build.
towers site rental revenues for 2015 were approximately $2.7 billion and increased by approximately $56.1 million, or 2%, from 2014. the increase in towers site rental revenues was impacted by the following items, inclusive of straight-line accounting, in no particular order: tenant additions across our entire portfolio, renewals or extensions of tenant leases, escalations, and non-renewals of tenant leases, predominately sprint's decommissioning of its legacy nextel iden network. tenant additions were influenced by our customers' ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity.
small cells site rental revenues for 2015 were approximately $284.4 million and increased by approximately $95.7 million, or 51%, from approximately $188.7 million in 2014. the increase in small cells site rental revenues was predominately (1) due to the leasing of newly constructed small cells and (2) impacted by the sunesys acquisition. demand for small cells was influenced by our customers' growing adoption of small cells as an important component of their network strategy to provide capacity and relieve network congestion.
the increase in towers site rental gross margins from 2014 to 2015 was related to the previously mentioned 2% increase in towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers. the increase in small cells site rental gross margins was predominately related to the previously mentioned 51% increase in small cells site rental revenues.
towers network services and other gross margin was approximately $282.6 million for 2015 and increased by approximately $10.7 million, or 4%, from approximately $271.9 million in 2014, which is a reflection of (1) the volume of activity from carrier network enhancements and (2) the volume and mix of network services and other work. our network services and other offerings are of a variable nature as these revenues are not under long-term contracts.
general and administrative expenses for 2015 increased by approximately $53.6 million, or approximately 21%, from 2014, and represented 8% of net revenues in 2015 and 7% of net revenues in 2014. general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stock-based compensation charges. the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the growth
30
in our business, including the expansion in size of our wireless infrastructure portfolio primarily due to acquisitions and growth in small cells.
towers operating profit for 2015 increased by approximately $40.6 million, or 2%, from 2014. towers operating profit was primarily impacted by the growth in our towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers.
small cells operating profit for 2015 increased by approximately $47.2 million, or 46%, from 2014. small cells operating profit was positively impacted by the previously mentioned sunesys acquisition and due to the leasing of newly constructed small cells.
adjusted ebitda increased by approximately $67.9 million, or 3%, from 2014 to 2015. adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the growth in our site rental activities, partially offset by the aforementioned increase in general and administrative expenses.
depreciation, amortization, and accretion for 2015 increased by approximately $50.4 million, or 5%, from 2014. this increase predominately resulted from capital expenditures and acquisitions, including the sunesys acquisition.
interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs decreased by approximately $46.2 million, or 8%, from 2014 to 2015, primarily as a result of a $44.4 million decrease in the amortization of previously settled interest rate swaps.
as a result of repaying and redeeming certain of our debt, we incurred net losses of approximately $4.2 million and approximately $44.6 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. for a further discussion of the debt refinancings, see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources" and "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
our acquisition and integration expenses for 2014 were approximately $34.1 million and were related to our 2012 and 2013 acquisitions. see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
other income (expense) for 2015 was income of approximately $57.0 million, compared to income of approximately $12.0 million for 2014. this change was predominately a result of gains recorded during 2015 on foreign currency swaps that we entered into to manage and reduce our foreign currency risk related to our may 2015 sale of ccal. see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.
the benefit (provision) for income taxes for 2015 was a benefit of approximately $51.5 million compared to a benefit of approximately $11.2 million for 2014. for 2015, the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to (1) our reit status, including the dividends paid deduction, and (2) the de-recognition of net deferred tax liabilities related to the inclusion of small cells in the reit in january 2016, which resulted in a non-cash income tax benefit of approximately $33.8 million. for 2014, the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to our reit status, including the dividends paid deduction. see "item 7. md&a-accounting and reporting matters-critical accounting policies and estimates" and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
income from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased from 2014 to 2015 due to the sale of ccal occurring mid-period on may 28, 2015. in addition, during 2015, we recorded a gain on the sale of discontinued operations, net of tax, of approximately $1.0 billion.
net income (loss) attributable to ccic stockholders for 2015 was income of approximately $1.5 billion compared to income of approximately $390.5 million for 2014. the increase in net income was predominately due to the gain recorded on the sale of ccal of approximately $1.0 billion.
liquidity and capital resources overview general. our core business generates revenues under long-term leases (see "item 7. md&a-general overview-overview") predominately from the largest u.s. wireless carriers. our strategy is to create long-term stockholder value via a combination of (1) growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of wireless infrastructure, (2) returning a meaningful portion of our cash provided by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends and (3) investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and long-term dividends per share. we measure our efforts to create "long-term stockholder value" by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results. see "item 1. business-strategy" for a further discussion of our strategy.
31
we have and expect to continue to engage in discretionary investments that we believe will maximize long-term stockholder value. our historical discretionary investments include (in no particular order): purchasing our common stock, acquiring or constructing wireless infrastructure, acquiring land interests under towers, improving and structurally enhancing our existing wireless infrastructure, and purchasing, repaying, or redeeming our debt. we have recently spent and expect to continue to spend a significant percentage of our discretionary investments on the construction of new small cell networks. we seek to fund our discretionary investments with both net cash provided by operating activities and cash available from financing capacity, such as the use of our undrawn availability from the 2016 revolver, debt financings and issuances of equity or equity related securities, including under our atm program.
we seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives long-term stockholder value and optimizes our weighted-average cost of capital.  we target a leverage ratio of approximately four to five times adjusted ebitda and interest coverage of approximately three times adjusted ebitda, subject to various factors such as the availability and cost of capital and the potential long-term return on our discretionary investments. we may choose to increase or decrease our leverage or coverage from these targets for various periods of time.
we operate as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. we expect to continue to pay minimal cash income taxes as a result of our reit status and our nols. see "item 1. business-2016 industry highlights and company developments-reit status," "item 7. md&a-general overview" and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
liquidity position. the following is a summary of our capitalization and liquidity position as of december 31, 2016, after giving effect to (1) the fibernet acquisition and (2) the 2017 refinancings. see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt.

over the next 12 months:
•   our liquidity sources may include (1) cash on hand, (2) net cash provided by operating activities, (3) undrawn availability from our 2016 revolver, and (4) issuances of equity pursuant to our atm program. our liquidity uses over the next 12 months are expected to include (1) debt service obligations of approximately $101.7 million (principal payments), (2) common stock dividend payments expected to be $3.80 per share, or an aggregate of at least $1.3 billion, subject to future approval by our board of directors (see "item 7. md&amp;a-general overview-common stock dividend"), and (3) sustaining and discretionary capital expenditures (expected to be equal to or greater than current levels). during the next 12 months, we expect that our liquidity sources should be sufficient to cover our expected uses. as ccic is a holding company, this cash flow from operations is generated by our operating subsidiaries.
•   we have no scheduled contractual debt maturities other than principal payments on amortizing debt. see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for a tabular presentation of our debt maturities as of december 31, 2016 and a discussion of anticipated repayment dates.

operating activities the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for 2016 from 2015 was due primarily to a net decrease in working capital, partially offset by growth in our core business. the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 from 2014 was due primarily to growth in our core business, including a net benefit from changes in working capital. changes in working capital (including changes in accounts receivable, deferred site rental receivables, deferred rental revenues, prepaid ground leases, restricted cash, and accrued interest) can have a significant impact on net cash provided by operating activities, largely due to the timing of prepayments and receipts. we expect to grow our net cash provided by operating activities in the future (exclusive of movements in working capital) if we realize expected growth in our core business.
investing activities capital expenditures our capital expenditures are categorized as discretionary or sustaining, as described below.
•   discretionary capital expenditures are those capital expenditures made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. they consist of improvements to existing wireless infrastructure, construction of new wireless infrastructure, and, to a lesser extent, purchases of land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers. improvements to existing wireless infrastructure to accommodate tenant additions typically vary based on, among other factors: (1) the type of wireless infrastructure, (2) the scope, volume, and mix of work performed on the wireless infrastructure, (3) existing capacity prior to installation, or (4) changes in structural engineering regulations and standards. our decisions regarding capital expenditures are influenced by the availability and cost of capital and expected returns on alternative uses of cash, such as payments of dividends and investments.
•   sustaining capital expenditures consist of (1) corporate-related capital improvements and (2) maintenance on our wireless infrastructure assets that enable our customers' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the wireless infrastructure.
33
a summary of our capital expenditures for the last three years is as follows (in thousands of dollars):
capital expenditures decreased from 2015 to 2016 and were impacted by (1) the construction of small cell networks to address our customers growing demand for small cell networks, (2) lower amounts of improvements to existing towers and (3) lower sustaining capital expenditures in 2016 due to expansion of office facilities in 2015. our sustaining capital expenditures have historically been less than 2% of net revenues annually and were approximately 3% of net revenues in 2015 due to expansion of our office facilities. see "item 7. md&a-general overview-outlook highlights" for a discussion of our expectations surrounding 2017 capital expenditures.
sale of ccal. see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our may 2015 sale of ccal, our previously 77.6% owned australian subsidiary.
foreign currency swaps. during may 2015, in conjunction with our sale of ccal, we entered into foreign currency swaps to manage and reduce our foreign currency risk associated with the sale of ccal. see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.
acquisitions.  acquisitions consist of the acquisition of businesses such as towers and small cells, including fiber portfolios. see notes 4 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our acquisitions during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. see also note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the fibernet acquisition.
financing activities we seek to allocate cash generated by our operations in a manner that will enhance long-term stockholder value, which may include various financing activities, such as (in no particular order) paying dividends on our common stock (currently expected to total an aggregate of at least $1.3 billion during the next 12 months, subject to future approval by our board of directors), purchasing our common stock, or purchasing, repaying, or redeeming our debt. see notes 8 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
34
in 2015, our financing activities predominately related to the following:
•   paying an aggregate of $1.1 billion in dividends on our common stock,
•   amending our previously outstanding 2012 credit facility, and
•   issuing $1.0 billion in may 2015 tower revenue notes which provided us with funding to repay $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of august 2010 tower revenue notes, redeem all of the previously outstanding wcp securitized notes, and repay portions of outstanding borrowings under our previously outstanding 2012 credit facility.
see "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources-overview" and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.
in 2016, our financing activities predominately related to the following:
•   paying an aggregate of $1.2 billion in dividends on our common stock,
•   completing a new senior unsecured credit facility and repaying all outstanding borrowings under the previously outstanding 2012 credit facility,
•   issuing $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in february 2016, which provided us the funding to (1) repay $500.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 revolver and (2) repay in full all outstanding borrowings under the previously outstanding $1.0 billion 364-day facility (as defined below),
•   issuing $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in may 2016, which provided us the funding to (1) repay in full the tower revenue notes, series 2010-2 and series 2010-5 issued by certain of our subsidiaries and (2) repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 revolver,
•   issuing $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, which provided us funding to (1) repay in full the 2.381% secured notes issued by certain of our subsidiaries, and (2) repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 revolver, and
•   issuing 11.4 million shares of common stock, generating net proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion; we utilized proceeds from such offering to partially fund the fibernet acquisition.
in february 2017, we (1) issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.000% senior unsecured notes and utilized the net proceeds to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings on the 2016 credit facility and (2) entered into an amendment to the 2016 credit facility to incur additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million and extend the maturity of both the 2016 term loan a and the 2016 revolver to january 21, 2022.
see "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources-overview" and notes 8 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our recent debt activities. see also "item 7. md&a-general overview-common stock dividend" for a discussion of the increase to our common stock dividend during the fourth quarter of 2016.
incurrences, purchases and repayments of debt. see notes 8 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our recent issuances, purchases, and repayments of debt. our debt issuances extended the maturities of our debt portfolio, provided funding for our acquisitions and our repayment of previously existing debt, and lowered our cost of debt. see "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources-overview-liquidity position." certain of our wireless infrastructure is held in subsidiaries whose equity interests have been pledged, directly or indirectly, along with other collateral to secure such indebtedness. see notes 8 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements.
common stock. as of december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we had 360.5 million, 333.8 million, and 333.9 million common shares outstanding, respectively. in november 2016, we completed an equity offering of approximately 11.4 million shares of common stock, which generated net proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion. we utilized proceeds from such offering to partially fund the fibernet acquisition in january 2017. see also "convertible preferred stock" below. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we paid an aggregate of $1.2 billion in dividends on our common stock. see "item 1. business-strategy" and note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
atm program. in august 2015, we established an atm program through which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate cumulative gross sales price of up to $500.0 million to or through sales agents. sales, if any, under the atm program may be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the new york stock exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to our specific instructions, at negotiated prices. we intend to use the net proceeds from any sales under the atm program for general corporate purposes, which may include the funding of future acquisitions or investments and the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding
35
indebtedness. during the year ended december 31, 2016, 3.8 million shares of our common stock were sold under the atm program generating net proceeds of $323.8 million. the net proceeds from the sales under the atm program were used, in part, to fund the tdc acquisition. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
convertible preferred stock. during october and november 2016, our approximately 9.8 million shares of convertible preferred stock converted to approximately 11.6 million shares of our common stock at a conversion rate (based on the applicable market value of the common stock and subject to certain anti-dilutive adjustments) of 1.188 common shares for each share of previously outstanding convertible preferred stock. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the convertible preferred stock dividends declared and paid during 2016 and the october and november 2016 conversion of the convertible preferred stock to common stock.
credit facility. in january 2016, we completed a new unsecured 2016 credit facility, consisting of (1) a $2.5 billion unsecured 2016 revolver maturing on january 21, 2021, (2) a $1.0 billion senior unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility ("364-day facility") maturing on january 19, 2017, and (3) a $2.0 billion senior unsecured term loan a facility ("2016 term loan a") maturing on january 21, 2021. in february 2016, the 364-day facility was terminated. see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.
the 2016 credit facility bears interest at a per annum rate equal to libor plus 1.125% to 2.000%, based on our senior unsecured debt rating.
the proceeds of the loans under the 2016 credit facility, together with cash on hand, were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the previously outstanding 2012 credit facility.
the 2016 revolver may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing of capital expenditures, acquisitions, and purchases of our common stock. see notes 4, 8, and 19 to our consolidated financial statements.
as of february 15, 2017, there was approximately $2.4 billion in availability under the 2016 revolver.  see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements.
restricted cash. pursuant to the indentures governing certain of our operating companies' debt securities, all rental cash receipts of the issuers of these debt instruments and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by an indenture trustee. the restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to us in accordance with the terms of the indentures. see also note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december 31, 2016, after giving effect to (1) the fibernet acquisition and (2) the 2017 refinancings. these contractual cash obligations relate primarily to our outstanding borrowings or lease obligations for land interests under our towers. the debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates on the tower revenue notes (see footnote (b)).

____________________
(a)   the following items are in addition to the obligations disclosed in the above table:
•   we have a legal obligation to perform certain asset retirement activities, including requirements upon lease and easement terminations to remove wireless infrastructure or remediate the land upon which our wireless infrastructure resides. the cash obligations disclosed in the above table, as of december 31, 2016, are exclusive of estimated undiscounted future cash outlays for asset retirement obligations of approximately $1.2 billion. as of december 31, 2016, the net present value of these asset retirement obligations was approximately $146.1 million.
•   we are contractually obligated to pay or reimburse others for property taxes related to our wireless infrastructure.
•   we have the option to purchase approximately 53% of our towers that are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, and other agreements with at&amp;t, sprint, and t-mobile at the end of their respective lease terms. we have no obligation to exercise such purchase options. see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
•   we have legal obligations for open purchase order commitments obtained in the ordinary course of business that have not yet been fulfilled.
36
(b)   the impact of principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of our tower revenue notes are not considered. the tower revenue notes have principal amounts of, $2.3 billion, $300.0 million and $700.0 million, with anticipated repayment dates in 2020, 2022 and 2025, respectively. see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.
(c)   if the tower revenue notes are not repaid in full by the applicable anticipated repayment dates, the applicable interest rate increases by approximately 5% per annum and monthly principal payments commence using the excess cash flow (as defined in the indenture governing the applicable tower revenue notes) of the issuers of the tower revenue notes. the tower revenue notes are presented based on their contractual maturity dates ranging from 2037 to 2045 and include the impact of an assumed 5% increase in interest rate that would occur following the anticipated repayment dates but exclude the impact of monthly principal payments that would commence using excess cash flow (as defined in the indenture governing the applicable tower revenue notes) of the issuers of the tower revenue notes. the full year 2016 excess cash flow (as defined in the indenture governing the applicable tower revenue notes) of the issuers of the tower revenue notes was approximately $563.8 million. we currently expect to refinance these notes on or prior to the respective anticipated repayment dates.
(d)   interest payments on the floating rate debt are based on estimated rates currently in effect.
(e)   amounts relate primarily to lease obligations for the land interests on which our wireless infrastructure resides and are based on the assumption that payments will be made through the end of the period for which we hold renewal rights. see table below summarizing remaining terms to expiration.
the following chart summarizes our rights to the land interests under our towers, including renewal terms at our option, as of december 31, 2016. as of december 31, 2016, the leases for land interests under our towers had an average remaining life in excess of 30 years, weighted based on towers site rental gross margin. see "item 1a. risk factors."
(a)   for the year ended december 31, 2016, without consideration of the term of the tenant lease.
(b)   inclusive of fee interests and perpetual easements.
37
debt covenants the credit agreement governing the 2016 credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants. we are currently in compliance with these financial maintenance covenants and, based upon our current expectations, we believe we will continue to comply with these financial maintenance covenants. in addition, certain of our debt agreements also contain restrictive covenants that place restrictions on us and may limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt and liens, purchase our securities, make capital expenditures, dispose of assets, undertake transactions with affiliates, make other investments, pay dividends or distribute excess cash flow. see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt covenants. see "item 1a. risk factors." the following are ratios applicable to the financial maintenance covenants under the credit agreement governing our 2016 credit facility as of december 31, 2016.

off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k.
accounting and reporting matters critical accounting policies and estimates the following is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that we believe (1) are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations or (2) require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. the critical accounting policies and estimates for 2016 are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies. in many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap. in other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions.
revenue recognition. 82% of our total revenue for 2016 consists of site rental revenues, which are recognized on a monthly basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the relevant lease (generally ranging from five to 15 years), regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts. if the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), upfront payments or rent free periods, the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the lease. when calculating our straight-line rental revenues, we consider all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element (such as an escalator tied to an inflation-based index) in addition to a minimum. to the extent we acquire below-market tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on the acquired wireless infrastructure (for example with respect to small cells) we record deferred credits and amortize such deferred credits to site rental revenues over their estimated lease term. since we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis, a portion of the site rental revenue in a given period represents cash collected or contractually collectible in other periods. our assets related to straight-line site rental revenues are included in "other current assets" and "deferred site rental receivables, net." amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in "deferred revenues" and "other long-term liabilities." see notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements.
as part of our effort to provide comprehensive wireless infrastructure solutions, we also offer certain network services relating to our wireless infrastructure, which represent approximately 18% of our total revenues for 2016. network services and other revenue consists of (1) site development services and (2) installation services. network services revenues are recognized after completion of the applicable service. we account for network services separately from the customer's site rental. see "item 1. business-the company" for a further discussion of our business.
38
accounting for acquisitions - general. as described in "item 1. business," much of our wireless infrastructure has been acquired in various transactions from the four largest wireless carriers (or their predecessors) through transactions consummated since 1999. we evaluate each of our acquisitions to determine if it should be accounted for as a business combination or as an acquisition of assets. for our business combinations, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill. see "item 7. md&a-accounting and reporting matters-accounting for acquisitions-valuation" below.
the determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized. such changes could have a significant impact on our financial statements.
accounting for acquisitions - leases. with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate, such as the at&t, t-mobile, and sprint leased and subleased towers, we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases. the evaluation of such agreements for capital or operating lease treatment includes consideration of each of the lease classification criteria under asc 840-10-25, namely (1) the transfer of ownership provisions, (2) the existence of bargain purchase options, (3) the length of the remaining lease term, and (4) the present value of the minimum lease payments. with respect to the at&t acquisition, t-mobile acquisition, and the sprint towers acquired in the global signal acquisition, we determined that the tower leases were capital leases and the underlying land leases were operating leases based upon the lease term criterion, after considering the fragmentation criteria applicable under asc 840-10-25 to leases involving both land and buildings (i.e., towers). we determined that the fragmentation criteria was met, and the tower leases could be accounted for as capital leases apart from the land leases, which are accounted for as operating leases, since (1) the fair value of the land in the aforementioned business combinations was greater than 25% of the total fair value of the leased property at inception and (2) the tower lease expirations occur beyond 75% of the estimated economic life of the tower assets.
accounting for acquisitions - valuation. as of december 31, 2016, our largest asset was property and equipment, which primarily consists of wireless infrastructure, followed by goodwill and intangible assets. our identifiable intangible assets predominately relate to the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the nature and composition of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets.
the fair value of the vast majority of our assets and liabilities is determined by using either:
(1)   estimates of replacement costs (for tangible fixed assets such as towers), or
(2)   discounted cash flow valuation methods (for estimating identifiable intangibles such as site rental contracts and customer relationships and above-market and below-market leases).
the purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that, if incorrectly estimated, could be material to our consolidated financial statements, including the amount of depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense. the most important estimates for measurement of tangible fixed assets are (1) the cost to replace the asset with a new asset and (2) the economic useful life after giving effect to age, quality, and condition. the most important estimates for measurement of intangible assets are (1) discount rates and (2) timing and amount of cash flows including estimates regarding customer renewals and cancellations. the most important estimates for measurement of above and below-market leases is the determination of (1) favorability or unfavorability to the current market terms and (2) applicable lease term, including whether renewals or extensions should be measured. with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate, such as the t-mobile, sprint, and at&t leased and subleased towers, we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases and identification of any bargain purchase options.
we record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities, including requirements, pursuant to our ground leases or easements, to remove wireless infrastructure or remediate the land upon which our wireless infrastructure resides. in determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to: (1) timing of cash flows, (2) future costs, (3) discount rates, and (4) the probability of enforcement to remove the towers or small cells or remediate the land. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
accounting for long-lived assets - useful lives. we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense that, if incorrectly estimated, could be material to our consolidated financial statements. depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets. the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our wireless infrastructure which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of (1) 20 years or (2) the term of the lease (including optional renewals) for the land interests under the wireless infrastructure.
39
the useful life of our intangible assets is estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit us and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate. we review the expected useful lives of our intangible assets on an ongoing basis and adjust if necessary. amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets. the useful life of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets is limited by the maximum depreciable life of the wireless infrastructure (20 years), as a result of the interdependency of the wireless infrastructure and site rental contracts and customer relationships. in contrast, the site rental contracts and customer relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of tenant cancellations and high rate of renewals experienced to date. thus, while site rental contracts and customer relationships are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and customer relationships which includes assumptions regarding both (1) tenants' exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired leases and (2) renewals of the acquired leases past the contractual term including exercisable options, the site rental contracts are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years as a result of the useful life being limited by the depreciable life of the wireless infrastructure.
accounting for long-lived assets - impairment evaluation - intangibles. we review the carrying values of property and equipment, intangible assets, or other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. we utilize the following dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of the site rental contracts and customer relationships:
(1)   we pool site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups, and
(2)   we separately pool site rental contracts and customer relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants, as appropriate.
we first pool site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing, because we view wireless infrastructure as portfolios and wireless infrastructure in a given portfolio and its related tenant leases are not largely independent of the other wireless infrastructure in the portfolio. we re-evaluate the appropriateness of the pooled groups at least annually. this use of grouping is based in part on (1) our limitations regarding disposal of wireless infrastructure, (2) the interdependencies of wireless infrastructure portfolios, and (3) the manner in which wireless infrastructure is traded in the marketplace. the vast majority of our site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment are pooled into the u.s. owned wireless infrastructure group. secondly, and separately, we pool site rental contracts and customer relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants, as appropriate, for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we associate the value ascribed to site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets to the underlying contracts and related customer relationships acquired.
our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable will generally involve (1) a deterioration in an asset's financial performance compared to historical results, (2) a shortfall in an asset's financial performance compared to forecasted results, or (3) changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset. when considering the utility of our assets, we consider events that would meaningfully impact (1) our wireless infrastructure or (2) our customer relationships. for example, consideration would be given to events that impact (1) the structural integrity and longevity of our wireless infrastructure or (2) our ability to derive benefit from our existing customer relationships, including events such as bankruptcy or insolvency or loss of a significant customer. during 2016, there were no events or circumstances that caused us to review the carrying value of our intangible assets or property and equipment due in part to our assets performing consistently with or better than our expectations.
if the sum of the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted) from an asset, or portfolio group, significant tenant or tenant group (for individually insignificant tenants), as applicable, is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss may be recognized. if the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows, measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows. the most important estimates for such calculations of undiscounted cash flows are (1) the expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our wireless infrastructure and (2) estimates regarding tenant cancellations and renewals of leases. we could record impairments in the future if changes in long-term market conditions, expected future operating results or the utility of the assets results in changes for our impairment test calculations which negatively impact the fair value of our property and equipment and intangible assets, or if we changed our unit of account in the future.
40
when grouping assets into pools for purposes of impairment evaluation, we also consider individual towers, nodes, and third party land interests within a grouping for which we currently have no tenants. approximately 3% of our total towers currently have no tenants. we continue to pay operating expenses on these towers in anticipation of obtaining tenants on these towers in the future, primarily because of the individual tower site demographics. we estimate, based on current visibility, potential tenants on approximately half of these towers. to the extent we do not believe there are long-term prospects of obtaining tenants on an individual tower, node, or third party land interest and all other possible avenues for recovering the carrying value has been exhausted, including sale of the asset, we appropriately reduce the carrying value of such assets to fair value.
accounting for long-lived assets - impairment evaluation - goodwill. we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred. the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units. we then perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is "more likely than not" that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if it is concluded that it is "more likely than not" that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. otherwise the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. our reporting units are the same as our operating segments (towers and small cells). see note 16. we performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1, 2016, which resulted in no impairments. this assessment included consideration of our market capitalization which was approximately four times the aggregate carrying amount of the reporting units as of december 31, 2016.
deferred income taxes. we operate as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. our reit taxable income is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as a result of the deduction for dividends paid and any usage of our remaining nols. accordingly, the only provision or benefit for federal income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2016 relates to trss.  furthermore, as a result of the deduction for dividends paid, some or all of our nols related to our reit may expire without utilization.  see "item 1. business-2016 industry highlights and company developments-reit status" for a discussion of the impact of our reit status.
our trss will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state income taxes and foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located.  see "item 1. business-2016 industry highlights and company developments-reit status" for a discussion of our inclusion of small cells in the reit effective january 4, 2016. our ability to utilize our nols is dependent, in part, upon our having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire. if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols, we would be required to record an additional valuation allowance, which would reduce our earnings. such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment. the change in our valuation allowance has no effect on our cash flows. for a further discussion of our benefit (provision) for income taxes and our reit conversion, see "item 7. md&a-results of operations" and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting pronouncements. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
non-gaap and segment financial measures in addition to the non-gaap measures used herein and as discussed in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements, we also provide (1) segment site rental gross margin, (2) segment network services and other gross margin, and (3) segment operating profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate our operating segments for purposes of making decisions about allocating capital and assessing performance. these segment measures are provided pursuant to gaap requirements related to segment reporting.
we define segment site rental gross margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental cost of operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated cost of operations. we define segment network services and other gross margin as segment network services and other revenues less segment network services and other cost of operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated cost of operations. we define segment operating profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment network services and other gross margin, less general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment.
we use earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and accretion, as adjusted ("adjusted ebitda"), which is a non-gaap measure, as an indicator of consolidated financial performance. our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in the wireless infrastructure sector or other reits, and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap. adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income or loss, net income or loss, net cash provided by (used for) operating, investing
41
and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap and should be considered only as a supplement to net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance. there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda, including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company, including our competitors, and the inability to analyze certain significant items, including depreciation and interest expense, that directly affect our net income or loss. management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income (loss).
we define adjusted ebitda as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on retirement of long-term obligations, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, gains (losses) on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense. the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our net income (loss) is set forth below and excludes items in the company's adjusted ebitda definition which are not applicable to the periods shown.

(a)   the above reconciliation excludes the items included in the company's adjusted ebitda definition which are not applicable to the periods shown.
we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance because:
•   it is the primary measure used by our management to evaluate (1) the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations;
•   although specific definitions may vary, it is widely used by investors or other interested parties in evaluation of the wireless infrastructure sector and other reits to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets;
•   we believe it helps investors and other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results; and
•   it is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations.
our management uses adjusted ebitda:
•   as a performance goal in employee annual incentive compensation;
•   as a measurement of financial performance because it assists us in comparing our financial performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization, and accretion) from our operating results;
•   in presentations to our board of directors to enable it to have the same measurement of financial performance used by management;
•   for planning purposes, including preparation of our annual operating budget;
42
•   as a valuation measure in strategic analyses in connection with the purchase and sale of assets;
•   in determining self-imposed limits on our debt levels, including the evaluation of our leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio; and
•   with respect to compliance with our debt covenants, which require us to maintain certain financial ratios including, or similar to, adjusted ebitda.

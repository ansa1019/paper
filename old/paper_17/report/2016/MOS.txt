item 1a. risk factors.
our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties described below.
our esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 30 years.
since december 1985, we have had inflows of salt saturated brine into our esterhazy, saskatchewan mine. over the past century, several potash mines experiencing water inflow problems have flooded. in order to control brine inflows at esterhazy, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenditures, certain of which, due to their nature, have been capitalized, while others have been charged to expense.
21
at various times, we experience changing amounts and patterns of brine inflows at the esterhazy mine. periodically, some of these inflows have exceeded available pumping capacity. if that were to continue for several months without abatement, it could exceed our available storage capacity and ability to effectively manage the brine inflow. this could adversely affect production at the esterhazy mine. the brine inflow is variable, resulting in both net inflows (the rate of inflow is more than the amount we are pumping out of the mine) and net outflows (when we are pumping more brine out of the mine than the rate of inflow). there can be no assurance that:
•   our pumping, surface storage, underground storage or injection well capacities for brine will continue to be sufficient, or that the pumping, grouting and other measures that we use to manage the inflows at the esterhazy mine will continue to be effective;
•   there will not be a disruption in the supply of calcium chloride, which is a primary material used to reduce or prevent the flow of incoming brine;
•   our estimates of the volumes of net inflows or net outflows of brine, or storage capacity for brine at the esterhazy mine, are accurate;
•   the volumes of the brine inflows will not fluctuate from time to time, the rate of the brine inflows will not be greater than our prior experience or current assumptions, changes in inflow patterns will not adversely affect our ability to locate and manage the inflows, or that any such fluctuations, increases or changes would not be material; and
•   the expenditures to control the inflows will be consistent with our prior experience or future estimates.
from time to time, new or improved technology becomes available to facilitate our remediation of the inflows, such as when horizontal drilling techniques were developed and refined. taking advantage of these new or improved technologies may require significant capital expenditures and/or may increase our costs of remediation.
it is possible that the costs of remedial efforts at esterhazy may further increase in the future and that such an increase could be material, or, in the extreme scenario, that the brine inflows, risk to employees or remediation costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining processes or abandon the mines. see "key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition" and "potash net sales and gross margin" in our management's analysis, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of costs, risks and other information relating to the brine inflows.
due to the ongoing brine inflow at esterhazy, subject to exceptions that are limited in scope and amount, we are unable to obtain insurance coverage for underground operations for water incursion problems. our mines at colonsay, saskatchewan, and carlsbad, new mexico, are also subject to the risks of inflow of water as a result of our shaft mining operations.
our operating results are highly dependent upon and fluctuate based upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry where we or our customers operate. these factors are outside of our control and may significantly affect our profitability.
our operating results are highly dependent upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, which we cannot control. the agricultural products business can be affected by a number of factors. the most important of these factors, for u.s. markets, are:
•   weather patterns and field conditions (particularly during periods of traditionally high crop nutrients consumption);
•   quantities of crop nutrients imported to and exported from north america;
•   current and projected grain inventories and prices, which are heavily influenced by u.s. exports and world-wide grain markets; and
•   u.s. governmental policies, including farm and biofuel policies, which may directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted, the level of grain inventories, the mix of crops planted or crop prices or otherwise negatively affect our operating results.
international market conditions, which are also outside of our control, may also significantly influence our operating results. the international market for crop nutrients is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the u.s. dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing crop nutrients, foreign agricultural policies, including subsidy policies, the existence of, or changes in, import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets, changes in the hard currency demands of certain countries and other regulatory policies of foreign governments, as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment.
22
our most important products are global commodities, and we face intense global competition from other crop nutrient producers that can affect our prices and volumes.
our most important products are concentrated phosphate crop nutrients, including diammonium phosphate, or dap, monoammonium phosphate, or map, microessentials® and muriate of potash, or mop. we sell most of our dap, map and mop in the form of global commodities. our sales of these products face intense global competition from other crop nutrient producers.
changes in competitors' production or shifts in their marketing focus have in the past significantly affected both the prices at which we sell our products and the volumes that we sell, and are likely to continue to do so in the future.
competitors are more likely to increase their production at times when world agricultural and crop nutrient markets are strong, and to focus on sales into regions where their returns are highest. increases in the global supply of dap, map and mop or competitors' increased sales into regions in which we have significant sales could adversely affect our prices and volumes.
competitors and potential new entrants in the markets for both concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and potash have in recent years expanded capacity, or begun, or announced plans, to expand capacity or build new facilities. the extent to which current global or local economic and financial conditions, changes in global or local economic and financial conditions, or other factors may cause delays or cancellation of some of these ongoing or planned projects, or result in the acceleration of existing or new projects, is unclear. in addition, the level of exports by producers of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients in china depends to a significant extent on chinese government actions to curb exports through, among other measures, prohibitive export taxes at times when the government believes it desirable to assure ample domestic supplies of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients to stimulate grain and oilseed production.
in addition, some of our competitors who are expanding their potash production capacity include other members of canpotex. canpotex members' respective shares of canpotex sales is based upon the members' respective proven peaking capacity for producing potash. when a canpotex member expands its production capacity, the new capacity is added to that member's proven peaking capacity based on a proving run at the maximum production level. alternatively, after january 2017, canpotex members may elect to rely on an independent engineering firm and approved protocols to calculate their proven peaking capacity. antitrust and competition laws prohibit the members of canpotex from coordinating their production decisions, including the timing of their respective proving runs. worldwide potash production levels during these proving runs could exceed then-current market demand, resulting in an oversupply of potash and lower potash prices.
we cannot accurately predict when or whether competitors' or new entrants' ongoing or planned capacity expansions or new facilities will be completed, the timing of competitors' tests to prove peaking capacity for canpotex purposes, the cumulative effect of these and recently completed expansions, the impact of future decisions by the chinese government on the level of chinese exports of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients, or the effects of these or other actions by our competitors on the prices for our products or the volumes that we will be able to sell.
our crop nutrients and other products are subject to price and demand volatility resulting from periodic imbalances of supply and demand, which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate.
historically, the market for crop nutrients has been cyclical, and prices and demand for our products have fluctuated to a significant extent, particularly for phosphates and, to a lesser extent, potash. periods of high demand, increasing profits and high capacity utilization tend to lead to new plant investment and increased production. this growth increases supply until the market is over-saturated, leading to declining prices and declining capacity utilization until the cycle repeats.
as a result, crop nutrient prices and volumes have been volatile. this price and volume volatility may cause our results of operations to fluctuate and potentially deteriorate. the price at which we sell our crop nutrient products and our sales volumes could fall in the event of industry oversupply conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in contrast, high prices may lead our customers and farmers to delay purchasing decisions in anticipation of future lower prices, thus impacting our sales volumes.
due to reduced market demand, depressed agricultural economic conditions and other factors, we and our predecessors have at various times suspended or reduced production at some of our facilities. the extent to which we utilize available capacity at our facilities will cause fluctuations in our results of operations, as we will incur costs for any temporary or indefinite shutdowns of our facilities and lower sales tend to lead to higher fixed costs as a percentage of sales.
23
variations in crop nutrient application rates may exacerbate the cyclicality of the crop nutrient markets.
farmers are able to maximize their economic return by applying optimum amounts of crop nutrients. farmers' decisions about the application rate for each crop nutrient, or to forego application of a crop nutrient, particularly phosphate and potash, vary from year to year depending on a number of factors, including among others, crop prices, crop nutrient and other crop input costs or the level of the crop nutrient remaining in the soil following the previous harvest. farmers are more likely to increase application rates when crop prices are relatively high, crop nutrient and other crop input costs are relatively low and the level of the crop nutrient remaining in the soil is relatively low. conversely, farmers are likely to reduce or forego application when farm economics are weak or declining or the level of the crop nutrients remaining in the soil is relatively high. this variability in application rates can materially accentuate the cyclicality in prices for our products and our sales volumes.
our crop nutrient business is seasonal, which may result in carrying significant amounts of inventory and seasonal variations in working capital, and our inability to predict future seasonal crop nutrient demand accurately may result in excess inventory or product shortages.
the crop nutrient business is seasonal. farmers tend to apply crop nutrients during two short application periods, the strongest one in the spring before planting and the other in the fall after harvest. as a result, the strongest demand for our products typically occurs during the spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. in contrast, we and other crop nutrient producers generally produce our products throughout the year. as a result, we and/or our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. the seasonality of crop nutrient demand results in our sales volumes and net sales typically being the highest during the north american spring season and our working capital requirements typically being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season. our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns.
if seasonal demand exceeds our projections, we will not have enough product and our customers may acquire products from our competitors, which would negatively impact our profitability. if seasonal demand is less than we expect, we will be left with excess inventory and higher working capital and liquidity requirements. the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors.
the distribution channels for crop nutrients have capacity to build significant levels of inventories, which can adversely affect our sales volumes and selling prices.
in order to balance the production needs of crop nutrient producers with farmers' seasonal use of crop nutrients, crop nutrient distribution channels need to have the capacity to build significant inventories. the build-up of inventories in the distribution channels can become excessive, particularly during the cyclical periods of low demand that have been typical in the crop nutrient industry. when there are excessive inventories in the distribution channel, our sales volumes and selling prices can be adversely impacted, even during periods in which farmers' use of crop nutrients may remain strong.
changes in transportation costs can affect our sales volumes and selling prices.
the cost of delivery is a significant factor in the total cost to customers and farmers of crop nutrients. as a result, changes in transportation costs or in customer expectations about them can affect our sales volumes and prices.
customer expectations about future events can have a significant effect on the demand for our products. these expectations can significantly affect our sales volumes and selling prices.
customer expectations about future events have had and are expected to continue to have an effect on the demand and prices for crop nutrients. future events that may be affected by customer expectations include, among others:
•   customer expectations about future crop nutrient prices and availability.
customer expectations about selling prices and availability of crop nutrients have had and are expected to continue to have an effect on the demand for crop nutrients. when customers anticipate increasing crop nutrient selling prices, customers tend to accumulate inventories before the anticipated price increases. this can result in a lag in our realization of rising market prices for our products. conversely, customers tend to delay their purchases when they anticipate future selling prices for crop nutrients will stabilize or decrease, adversely affecting our sales volumes and selling prices. customer expectations about availability of crop nutrients can have similar effects on sales volumes and prices.
24
•   customer expectations about future farmer economics.
similarly, customer expectations about future farmer economics have had and are expected to continue to have an effect on the demand for crop nutrients. when customers anticipate improving farmer economics, customers tend to accumulate crop nutrient inventories in anticipation of increasing sales volumes and selling prices. this can result in a lag in our realization of rising market prices for our products. conversely, when customers anticipate declining farmer economics, customers tend to reduce the level of their purchases of crop nutrients, adversely affecting our sales volumes and selling prices.
•   changes in customer expectations about transportation costs.
as discussed above, increasing transportation costs effectively increase customers' and farmers' costs for crop nutrients and can reduce the amount we realize for our sales. expectations of decreasing transportation costs can result in customers and farmers anticipating that they may be able to decrease their costs by delaying purchases. as a result, changes in customer expectations about transportation costs can affect our sales volumes and prices.
we conduct our operations primarily through a limited number of key production and distribution facilities. any disruption at one of these facilities could have a material adverse impact on our business. the risk of material disruption increases when demand for our products results in high operating rates at our facilities.
we conduct our operations through a limited number of key production and distribution facilities. these facilities include our phosphate mines and concentrates plants; our potash mines; and the ports and other distribution facilities through which we, canpotex and any joint ventures in which we participate, conduct our respective businesses, as well as other commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties. any disruption of operations at one of these facilities has the possibility of significantly affecting our production or our ability to distribute our products. operating these facilities at high rates during periods of high demand for our products increases the risk of mechanical or structural failures, decreases the time available for routine maintenance and increases the impact on our operating results from any disruption. a disruption of operations at one of our key facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
examples of the types of events that could result in a disruption at one of these facilities include: adverse weather; strikes or other work stoppages; deliberate, malicious acts, including acts of terrorism; political and economic instability; cyber attacks and other risks associated with our international operations; changes in permitting, financial assurance or other environmental, health and safety laws or other changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate; legal and regulatory proceedings; our relationships with other members of canpotex and any joint ventures in which we participate and their or our exit from participation in canpotex or any such joint ventures; other changes in our commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties; brine inflows at our esterhazy, saskatchewan, mine or our other shaft mines; mechanical failure and accidents occurring in the course of operating activities; and other factors.
insurance market conditions, our loss experience and other factors affect the insurance coverage that we carry, and we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. as a result, our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses.
we maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance policies, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. we are subject to various self-retentions and deductibles under these insurance policies. as a result of market conditions, our loss experience and other factors, our premiums, self-retentions and deductibles for insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. in addition, significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce, or possibly eliminate, coverage. as a result, a disruption of operations at one of our key facilities or a significant casualty could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
important raw materials and energy used in our businesses in the past have been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing. changes in the price of our raw materials could have a material impact on our businesses.
natural gas, ammonia and sulfur are key raw materials used in the manufacture of phosphate crop nutrient products. natural gas is used as both a chemical feedstock and a fuel to produce anhydrous ammonia, which is a raw material used in the production of concentrated phosphate products. natural gas is also a significant energy source used in the potash solution mining process. from time to time, our profitability has been and may in the future be impacted by the price and availability of these raw materials and other energy costs. because most of our products are commodities, there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass through increased costs to our customers. a significant increase in the price of natural gas, ammonia,
25
sulfur or energy costs that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our related crop nutrients products could have a material adverse impact on our business. in addition, under our long-term cf ammonia supply agreement we have agreed to purchase approximately 545,000 to 725,000 tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that may extend until december 31, 2032 at a price to be determined by a formula based on the prevailing price of u.s. natural gas. if the price of natural gas rises or the market price for ammonia falls outside of the range anticipated at execution of the agreement, we may not realize a cost benefit from the natural gas based pricing over the term of the agreement, or the cost of our ammonia under the agreement could be a competitive disadvantage.
during periods when the price for concentrated phosphates is falling because of falling raw material prices, we may experience a lag in realizing the benefits of the falling raw materials prices. this lag can adversely affect our gross margins and profitability.
during some periods, changes in market prices for raw materials can lead to changes in the global market prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients. in particular, the global market prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients can be affected by changes in the market prices for sulfur, ammonia, phosphate rock and/or phosphoric acid raw materials. increasing market prices for these raw materials tend to put upward pressure on the selling prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients, and decreasing market prices for these raw materials tend to put downward pressure on selling prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients. when the market prices for these raw materials plunge rapidly, the selling prices for our concentrated phosphate crop nutrients can fall more rapidly than we are able to consume our raw material inventory that we purchased or committed to purchase in the past at higher prices. as a result, our costs may not fall as rapidly as the selling prices of our products. until we are able to consume the higher priced raw materials, our gross margins and profitability can be adversely affected.
during periods when the prices for our products are falling because of falling raw material prices, we could be required to write-down the value of our inventories. any such write-down would adversely affect our results of operations and the level of our assets.
we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market. in periods when the market prices for our products are falling rapidly in response to falling market prices for raw materials, it is possible that we could be required to write-down the value of our inventories if market prices fall below our costs. any such write-down would adversely affect our results of operations and the level of our assets. any such effect could be material.
our estimates of future selling prices reflect in part the purchase commitments we have from our customers. as a result, defaults on these existing purchase commitments because of the global or local economic and financial conditions or for other reasons could adversely affect our estimates of future selling prices and require additional inventory write-downs.
in the event of a disruption to existing terminaling facilities or transportation for our products or raw materials, alternative terminaling facilities or transportation might not be available on a timely basis or have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our customers or facilities.
in the event of a disruption of existing terminaling facilities or transportation for our products or raw materials, alternative terminaling facilities or transportation might not be available on a timely basis or have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our customers or facilities.
terminaling facilities and transportation include the ports and other distribution facilities through which we, canpotex and the joint ventures in which we participate, conduct our respective businesses; transportation and related equipment arrangements; and other commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties.
examples of the types of events that could result in a disruption of terminaling facilities or transportation include: adverse weather; strikes or other work stoppages; deliberate, malicious acts; political and economic instability and other risks associated with our international operations; changes in permitting, financial assurance or other environmental, health and safety laws or other changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate; legal and regulatory proceedings; our relationships with other members of canpotex and any joint ventures in which we participate and their or our exit from participation in canpotex or any such joint ventures; other changes in our commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties; accidents occurring in the course of operating activities; lack of truck, rail, barge or ship transportation; and other factors. we discuss a number of these examples in more detail throughout this risk factors section.
26
we are subject to risks associated with our international sales and operations, which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in foreign countries. some of these factors may also make it less attractive to distribute cash generated by our operations outside the united states to our stockholders, or to utilize cash generated by our operations in one country to fund our operations or repayments of indebtedness in another country or to support other corporate purposes.
for 2016, we derived approximately 63% of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states, of which our international distribution segment accounted for 56%. as a result, we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including:
•   difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations;
•   unexpected changes in regulatory environments;
•   increased government ownership and regulation of the economy in the countries we serve;
•   political and economic instability, including the possibility for civil unrest, inflation and adverse economic conditions resulting from governmental attempts to reduce inflation, such as imposition of higher interest rates and wage and price controls;
•   nationalization of properties by foreign governments;
•   the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls, trade barriers or other restrictions, or government-imposed increases in the cost of resources and materials necessary for the conduct of our operations or the completion of strategic initiatives, including with respect to our joint ventures; and
•   currency exchange rate fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies, particularly the brazilian real and the canadian dollar.
the occurrence of any of the above in the countries in which we operate or elsewhere could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business there and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results and the value of our assets located outside of the united states.
in addition, tax regulations, currency exchange controls and other restrictions may also make it economically unattractive to:
•   distribute cash generated by our operations outside the united states to our stockholders; or
•   utilize cash generated by our operations in one country to fund our operations or repayments of indebtedness in another country or to support other corporate purposes.
changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities, could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
we are subject to taxes, including income taxes, resource taxes and royalties, and other non-income based taxes in the u.s., canada, china, brazil and other countries where we operate.  changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation could result in higher taxes, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
our international assets are located in countries with volatile conditions, which could subject us and our assets to significant risks.
we are a global business with substantial assets located outside of the united states and canada. our operations in brazil, china, india and paraguay are a fundamental part of our business. we also have joint venture investments in the miski mayo mine in peru that supplies phosphate rock to us, and mwspc, which is developing a mine and chemical complexes that we presently expect would produce phosphate fertilizers and other downstream products in the kingdom of saudi arabia. volatile economic, political and market conditions in these and other emerging market countries may have a negative impact on our operations, operating results and financial condition. in addition, unfavorable changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, or governmental actions and policies and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and the pricing and sourcing of our raw materials, may also have a negative impact on our operations, operating results and financial condition.
natural resource extraction is an important part of the economy in peru, and, in the past, there have been protests against other natural resource operations in peru. as of the date of this report, there remain numerous social conflicts that exist within the natural resource sector in peru and as a result there is potential for active protests against natural resource companies. if the government of peru's proactive efforts to address the social and environmental issues surrounding natural resource activities were not successful, protests could extend to or impact the miski mayo mine and adversely affect our investment in the miski mayo joint venture or the supply of phosphate rock to us from the mine.
27
adverse weather conditions, including the impact of hurricanes, and excess heat, cold, snow, rainfall and drought, have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect our operations, particularly our phosphates business, and result in increased costs, decreased production and potential liabilities.
adverse weather conditions, including the impact of hurricanes and excess heat, cold, snow, rainfall and drought, have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations, particularly our phosphates business. in the past, hurricanes have resulted in minor physical damage to our facilities in florida and louisiana. in addition, a release of process wastewater at our riverview, florida facility during a hurricane resulted in a small civil fine, settlement for an immaterial amount of claims for natural resource damages by governmental agencies and an ongoing private lawsuit.
additionally, water treatment costs, particularly at our florida operations, due to high water balances tend to increase significantly following excess rainfall from hurricanes or other adverse weather. some of our florida facilities have had or could have high water levels that may require treatment. high water balances in the past at phosphate facilities in florida also led the florida department of environmental protection ("fdep") to adopt new rules requiring phosphate production facilities to meet more stringent process water management objectives for phosphogypsum management systems.
if additional excess rainfall or hurricanes occur in coming years, our facilities may be required to take additional measures to manage process water to comply with existing or future requirements and these measures could potentially have a material effect on our business and financial condition.
adverse weather may also cause a loss of production due to disruptions in our supply chain or adversely affect delivery of our products to our customers. for example, oil refineries that supply sulfur to us may suspend operations as a result of a hurricane and incoming shipments of ammonia can be delayed, disrupting production at our florida or louisiana facilities and delivery of our products.
drought can also adversely affect us. for example, drought can reduce farmers' crop yields and the uptake of phosphates and potash, reducing the need for application of additional phosphates and potash for the next planting season. drought can also lower river levels, adversely affecting delivery of our products to our customers.
our operations are dependent on having the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities. denial or delay by a government agency in issuing any of our permits and approvals or imposition of restrictive conditions on us with respect to these permits and approvals may impair our business and operations.
we hold numerous governmental environmental, mining and other permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities. a decision by a government agency to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility.
expansion of our operations also is predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals. over the next several years, we and our subsidiaries will be continuing our efforts to obtain permits in support of our anticipated florida mining operations at certain of our properties.
a denial of, or delay in issuing, these permits, the issuance of permits with cost-prohibitive conditions, legal actions that prevent us from relying on permits or revocation of permits, could prevent us from mining at these properties and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
for example:
•   in florida, local community participation has become an important factor in the permitting process for mining companies, and various local counties and other parties in florida have in the past and continue to file lawsuits challenging the issuance of some of the permits we require. these actions can significantly delay permit issuance.
•   in fiscal 2009, in connection with our efforts to permit the altman extension of our four corners, florida, phosphate rock mine, non-governmental organizations filed a lawsuit in federal court against the corps with respect to its actions in issuing a federal wetlands permit. the permit issued by the corps remained in effect. mining on the extension commenced and approximately 600 acres were mined and/or disturbed. in september 2013, this lawsuit was dismissed by the united states district court for the middle district of florida, jacksonville division.
•   delays in receiving a federal wetlands permit impacted the scheduled progression of mining activities for the extension of our south fort meade, florida, phosphate rock mine into hardee county. as a result, we began to idle a portion of our mining equipment at the mine in the latter part of fiscal 2010. in june 2010, the corps issued the federal wetlands permit. subsequently, certain non-governmental organizations filed another lawsuit in the united states district court for the middle district of florida, jacksonville division, contesting the issuance of this federal
28
wetlands permit, alleging that the corps' actions in issuing the permit violated several federal laws relating to the protection of the environment. preliminary injunctions entered into in connection with this lawsuit resulted in shutdowns or reduced production at our south fort meade mine until april 2012. following a settlement of the lawsuit in february 2012 and court approval, we were able to resume normal production at our south fort meade mine.
the periods of shutdown and reduced phosphate rock production at our south fort meade mine resulted in costs to suspend operations and idle plant costs. lower phosphate rock mining production levels also adversely affected gross margin.
we have included additional discussion about permitting for our phosphate mines in florida under "environmental, health, safety and security matters-operating requirements and impacts-permitting" in our management's analysis.
we are subject to financial assurance requirements as part of our routine business operations. these financial assurance requirements affect our costs and increase our liquidity requirements. if we were unable to satisfy applicable financial assurance requirements, we might not be able to obtain or maintain permits we need to operate our business as we have in the past. our need to comply with these requirements could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
in many cases, as a condition to procuring or maintaining permits and approvals or otherwise, we are required to comply with financial assurance requirements of governmental authorities. the purpose of these requirements is to provide comfort to the government that sufficient funds will be available for the ultimate closure, post-closure care and/or reclamation of our facilities.
in some cases we are able to comply through the satisfaction of applicable state financial strength tests, but if we are unable to do so, we must utilize alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements or we could be subject to enforcement proceedings brought by relevant government agencies. potential alternative methods of compliance include providing credit support in the form of cash escrows or trusts, surety bonds from insurance companies, letters of credit from banks, or other forms of financial instruments or collateral to satisfy the financial assurance requirements or negotiating a consent agreement that establishes a different form of financial assurance. use of alternative means of financial assurance imposes additional expense on us. some of them, such as letters of credit, also use a portion of our available liquidity. other alternative means of financial assurance, such as surety bonds, may in some cases require collateral and generally require us to obtain a discharge of the bonds or to post additional collateral (typically in the form of cash or letters of credit) at the request of the issuer of the bonds. collateral that is required may be in many forms including letters of credit or other financial instruments that utilize a portion of our available liquidity, or in the form of assets such as real estate, which reduces our flexibility to manage or sell assets.
for example:
•   with respect to two facilities we acquired as part of the cf phosphate assets acquisition, (i) we have funded a trust to meet florida state regulations governing financial assurance related to the post-closure care of the phosphogypsum stack at our closed bonnie facility in florida, and (ii) under the terms of a consent decree with federal and state regulators we currently provide credit support in the form of a surety bond from insurance companies, as a means of financial assurance for closure and post-closure care requirements for the phosphogypsum stack at our plant city, florida facility. these financial assurance funding obligations require estimates of future expenditures that could be impacted by refinements in scope, technological developments, cost inflation, changes in regulations, discount rates and the timing of activities. additional funding could be required in the future if increases in cost estimates exceed the amount held in the trust or face amount of the surety bond, as applicable. in addition, with respect to the plant city facility, our use of a surety bond may in some cases require that we obtain a discharge of the bond or post collateral at the request of the issuers of the bond. required collateral may be in many forms including letters of credit or other financial instruments that utilize a portion of our available liquidity. any of these circumstances could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
•   as more fully discussed in note 13 of our notes to consolidated financial statements, in 2016 under the terms of two consent decrees with federal and state regulators we deposited a total of $630 million into two trust funds to provide additional financial assurance for the estimated costs of closure and post-closure care of most of our other phosphogypsum management systems in florida (excluding those acquired as part of the cf phosphate assets acquisition) and louisiana. as required under one of the consent decrees, we will also issue a $50 million letter of credit in 2017 to further support our financial assurance obligations. we have also agreed to guarantee the
29
difference between the amounts held in each trust fund (including earnings) and the estimated closure and long-term care costs. compliance with the financial assurance requirements included in these consent decrees satisfies substantially all of our state financial assurance obligations relating to the covered facilities, which were historically satisfied without the need for any expenditure of corporate funds to the extent our financial statements met certain balance sheet and income statement financial strength tests.
in the past, we have also not always been able to satisfy applicable financial strength tests, and in the future, it is possible that we will not be able to pass the applicable financial strength tests, negotiate or receive approval of consent decrees, establish escrow or trust accounts or obtain letters of credit, surety bonds or other financial instruments on acceptable terms and conditions or at a reasonable cost, or that the form and/or cost of compliance could increase, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
we have included additional discussion about financial assurance requirements under "off balance sheet arrangements and obligations-other commercial commitments" in our management's analysis.
the other environmental regulations to which we are subject may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition to permitting and financial assurance requirements, we are subject to numerous other environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the u.s., canada, china, brazil and other countries where we operate. these laws and regulations govern a wide range of matters, including environmental controls, land reclamation, discharges to air and water and remediation of hazardous substance releases. they significantly affect our operating activities as well as the level of our operating costs and capital expenditures. in some international jurisdictions, environmental laws change frequently and it may be difficult for us to determine if we are in compliance with all material environmental laws at any given time.
we are, and may in the future be, involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that could be material to us. these proceedings include "legacy" matters arising from activities of our predecessor companies and from facilities and businesses that we have never owned or operated.
we have in the past been, are currently and may in the future be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could be material to our business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. joint ventures in which we participate could also become subject to these sorts of proceedings. these proceedings may be brought by the government or private parties and may arise out of a variety of matters, including:
•   allegations by the government or private parties that we have violated the permitting, financial assurance or other environmental, health and safety laws and regulations discussed above. for example, in connection with our settlement of matters relating to the u.s. environmental protection agency's ongoing review of mineral processing industries under the u.s. resource conservation and recovery act, we entered into the consent decrees discussed above and in note 13 of our notes to consolidated financial statements, which required us to provide additional financial assurance as described above, pay cash penalties of approximately $8 million in the aggregate, and modify certain operating practices and undertake certain capital improvement projects over a period of several years that are expected to result in capital expenditures likely to exceed $200 million in the aggregate. we are also involved in other proceedings alleging that, or to review whether, we have violated environmental laws in the united states and brazil.
•   other environmental, health and safety matters, including alleged personal injury, wrongful death, complaints that our operations are adversely impacting nearby farms and other business operations, other property damage, subsidence from mining operations, natural resource damages and other damage to the environment, arising out of operations, including accidents. for example, several actions were initiated by the government and private parties related to a release of phosphoric acid process wastewater at our riverview, florida facility during a 2004 hurricane. in addition, a putative class action lawsuit was filed following the water loss incident that occurred at our new wales, florida facility in 2016 and in connection with that incident we also entered into an administrative consent order with the fdep as discussed in greater detail in note 21 of our notes to consolidated financial statements.
•   antitrust, commercial, tax (including tax audits) and other disputes. for example, we were one of a number of defendants in multiple class-action lawsuits, in which the plaintiffs sought unspecified amounts of damages including treble damages, alleging that we and other defendants conspired to, among other matters, fix the price at which potash was sold in the united states, allocated market shares and customers and fraudulently concealed their anticompetitive conduct. in january 2013, we settled these class action antitrust lawsuits for an aggregate of $43.8 million.
30
the legal and regulatory proceedings to which we are currently or may in the future be subject can, depending on the circumstances, result in monetary damage awards, fines, penalties, other liabilities, injunctions or other court or administrative rulings that interrupt, impede or otherwise materially affect our business operations, and/or criminal sanctions.
among other environmental laws, the u.s. comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ("cercla") imposes liability, including for cleanup costs, without regard to fault or to the legality of a party's conduct, on certain categories of persons, including current and former owners and operators of a site and parties who are considered to have contributed to the release of "hazardous substances" into the environment. under cercla, or various u.s. state analogues, a party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its proportional share of cleanup costs at a site where it has liability if payments cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. as a crop nutrient company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances, we will periodically incur liabilities and cleanup costs, under cercla and other environmental laws, with regard to our current or former facilities, adjacent or nearby third-party facilities or offsite disposal locations.
pending and potential legal and regulatory proceedings may arise out of our present activities, including operations at current facilities. they may also arise out of past activities by us, our predecessor companies and subsidiaries that our predecessors have sold. these past activities were in some cases at facilities that we and our subsidiaries no longer own or operate and may have never owned or operated.
settlements of legal and regulatory matters frequently require court approval. in the event a court were not to approve of a settlement, it is possible that we and the other party or parties to the matter might not be able to settle it on terms that were acceptable to all parties or that we could be required to accept more stringent terms of settlement than required by the opposing parties.
we have included additional information with respect to pending legal and regulatory proceedings in note 21 of our notes to consolidated financial statements and in this report in part i, item 3, "legal proceedings".
these legal and regulatory proceedings involve inherent uncertainties and could negatively impact our business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.
the permitting, financial assurance and other environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject may become more stringent over time. this could increase the effects on us of these laws and regulations, and the increased effects could be material.
continued government and public emphasis on environmental, health and safety issues in the u.s., canada, china, brazil, paraguay and other countries where we operate can be expected to result in requirements that apply to us and our operations that are more stringent than those that are described above and elsewhere in this report. these more stringent requirements may include among other matters increased levels of future investments and expenditures for environmental controls at ongoing operations which will be charged against income from future operations, increased levels of the financial assurance requirements to which we are subject, increased efforts or costs to obtain permits or denial of permits, other new or interpretations of existing statutes or regulations that impose new or more stringent restrictions or liabilities, including liabilities or additional financial assurance requirements under cercla or similar statutes, including restrictions or liabilities related to elevated levels of naturally-occurring radiation that arise from disturbing the ground in the course of mining activities, and other matters that could increase our expenses, capital requirements or liabilities or adversely affect our business, liquidity or financial condition. in addition, to the extent restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate, such as china, india, former soviet union countries or morocco, are less stringent than in the countries where we operate, our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us. these effects could be material.
among other matters, there are several recent or ongoing initiatives relating to nutrient discharges. new regulatory restrictions from these initiatives could have a material effect on either us or our customers. for example:
•   the fdep has adopted state nutrient criteria rules ("florida nnc rule") to supplant the requirements of numeric water quality standards for the discharge of nitrogen and/or phosphorus into florida lakes and streams that were adopted by epa in december 2010 (the "nnc rule"). while epa has withdrawn the federal nnc rule and the fdep criteria now are effective, the possibility remains that still-pending litigation relating to the nnc rule or future litigation could challenge epa's withdrawal or the effectiveness of the florida nnc rule. subject to further litigation developments, we expect that compliance with the requirements of nutrient criteria rules could adversely affect our florida phosphate operations, require significant capital expenditures or substantially increase our annual operating expenses.
31
•   the gulf coast ecosystem restoration task force, established by executive order of the president and comprised of five gulf states and eleven federal agencies, has delivered a final strategy for long-term ecosystem restoration for the gulf coast in 2016. the strategy calls for, among other matters, reduction of the flow of excess nutrients into the gulf through state nutrient reduction frameworks, new nutrient reduction approaches and reduction of agricultural and urban sources of excess nutrients. implementation of the strategy will require legislative or regulatory action at the state level. we cannot predict what the requirements of any such legislative or regulatory action could be or whether or how it would affect us or our customers.
•   in march 2012, several nongovernmental organizations brought a lawsuit in federal court against epa, seeking to require it to establish numeric nutrient criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in the mississippi river basin and the gulf of mexico. epa had previously denied a 2008 petition seeking such standards. on may 30, 2012, the court granted our motion to intervene in this lawsuit. on september 20, 2013 the court held that while epa was required to respond directly to the petition and find that numeric nutrient criteria either were or were not necessary for the mississippi river watershed, epa had the discretion to decide this issue based on non-technical factors, including cost, policy considerations and administrative complexity. epa appealed the decision, and the fifth circuit court of appeals issued a decision in april 2015, holding in substantial part that epa was not obligated to make a determination that numeric nutrient criteria are or are not necessary, provided epa gives a reasonable explanation for its conclusion. the court of appeals remanded the case to the district court to decide whether epa can meet that burden. on november 20, 2015, epa filed a motion with the district court seeking summary judgment and on january 14, 2016, non-state intervenors including mosaic filed a brief supporting epa's motion. on december 15, 2016, the louisiana district court granted epa's motion for summary judgment. in the event that epa were to adopt numeric nutrient criteria for the mississippi river basin and the gulf of mexico, we cannot predict what these requirements would be or the effects they would have on us or our customers.
in addition, in april 2014 epa and the u.s. army corps of engineers jointly issued a proposed rule that would redefine the scope of waters regulated under the federal clean water act.  the final rule was issued in june 2015 and became effective in august 2015, but has been challenged through numerous lawsuits. in october 2015, the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit issued an order staying the effectiveness of the final rule until after the legal validity of the regulation is resolved. we believe the new definition would expand the types and extent of water resources regulated under federal law, thereby potentially expanding our permitting and reporting requirements, increasing our costs of compliance, including costs associated with wetlands and stream mitigation, lengthening the time necessary to obtain permits, and potentially restricting our ability to mine certain of our phosphate rock reserves.  these effects could be material.
regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations in the united states, canada or elsewhere could adversely affect us, and these effects could be material.
various governmental initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions are under way or under consideration around the world. these initiatives could restrict our operating activities, require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs, reduce our efficiency or limit our output, require us to make capital improvements to our facilities, increase our energy, raw material and transportation costs or limit their availability, or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, and these effects could be material to us.
governmental greenhouse gas emission initiatives include, among others, the december 2015 agreement (the "paris agreement") which was the outcome of the 21st session of the conference of the parties under the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc). the paris agreement, which was signed by nearly 200 nations including the united states and canada, entered into force in late 2016 and sets out a goal of limiting the average rise in temperatures for this century to below 2 degrees celsius. each signatory is expected to develop its own plan (referred to as a nationally determined contribution, or "ndc") for reaching that goal.
the ndc submitted by the united states in 2015 aims to achieve, by 2025, an economy-wide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% below its 2005 level. it also aims to use best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28%. the u.s. target covers all greenhouse gases that were a part of the 2014 inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks. while it is unclear whether the new u.s. executive administration will seek to implement the u.s. ndc, various legislative or regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gases have already been adopted or considered by the u.s. congress, epa or various states and those already adopted may be used to implement the u.s.'s ndc. additionally, more stringent laws and regulations may be enacted to accomplish the goals set out in the ndc.
canada's intended ndc aims to achieve, by 2030, an economy-wide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels. in addition, in late 2016 the federal government announced plans for a comprehensive tax on carbon
32
emissions, under which provinces opting out of the tax would have the option of adopting a cap-and-trade system. while no tax has formally been proposed, as implementation of the paris agreement proceeds, more stringent laws and regulations may be enacted to accomplish the goals set out in canada's ndc. in addition, the province of saskatchewan, in which our canadian potash mines are located, has passed legislation to facilitate the development and administration of climate change regulation in saskatchewan by the province rather than the federal government. this legislation is not yet effective, but key elements under consideration by the province include establishing a provincial greenhouse gas emission reduction target, and compliance mechanisms that would provide flexibility for regulated emitters to meet their greenhouse gas reduction obligations. our saskatchewan potash facilities will continue to work with the saskatchewan ministry of environment and environment canada, through participation in industry associations, to determine next steps. we will also continue to monitor developments relating to the anticipated proposed legislation, as well as the potential future effect on our operating activities, energy, raw material and transportation costs, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.
it is possible that future legislation or regulation addressing climate change, including in response to the paris agreement or any new international agreements, could adversely affect our operating activities, energy, raw material and transportation costs, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, and these effects could be material. in addition, to the extent climate change restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate, such as china, india, former soviet union countries or morocco, are less stringent than in the united states or canada, our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us.
future climate change could adversely affect us.
the prospective impact of climate change on our operations and those of our customers and farmers remains uncertain. scientists have hypothesized that the impacts of climate change could include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels and that these changes could be severe. these impacts could vary by geographic location. at the present time, we cannot predict the prospective impact of climate change on our results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, or whether any such effects could be material to us.
some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage and adversely affect our sales and profitability. these competitors include state-owned and government-subsidized entities in other countries.
we compete with a number of producers throughout the world, including state-owned and government-subsidized entities. some of these entities may have greater total resources than we do, and may be less dependent on earnings from crop nutrients sales than we are. in addition, some of these entities may have access to lower cost or government-subsidized natural gas supplies, placing us at a competitive disadvantage. furthermore, certain governments as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products in order to support domestic employment or other political or social goals. to the extent other producers of crop nutrients enjoy competitive advantages or are willing to accept lower profit levels, the price of our products, our sales volumes and our profits may be adversely affected.
we do not own a controlling equity interest in our non-consolidated companies, some of which are foreign companies, and therefore our operating results and cash flow may be materially affected by how the governing boards and majority owners operate such businesses. there may also be limitations on monetary distributions from these companies that are outside of our control. together, these factors may lower our equity earnings or cash flow from such businesses and negatively impact our results of operations.
in 2013 we entered into an agreement to form mwspc, a joint venture to develop a mine and chemical complexes for an estimated $8.0 billion that is expected to produce phosphate fertilizers and other downstream products in the kingdom of saudi arabia. we have a 25% interest in the joint venture and expect our cash investment will be up to $850 million, approximately $707 million of which had been funded as of december 31, 2016. we also expect to provide financial guarantees with respect to our proportionate share of certain future planned funding facilities of mwspc. the success of mwspc will depend on, among other matters, its ability to obtain the future planned funding facilities in acceptable amounts and upon acceptable terms, the timely development and commencement of operations of production facilities in the kingdom of saudi arabia, the future success of current plans for the development and operation of mwspc, including the availability and affordability of necessary resources and materials and access to appropriate infrastructure, and any future changes in those plans, as well as the general economic and political stability of the region.
we also hold minority ownership interests in a joint venture that owns and operates a phosphate rock mine and in other companies that are not controlled by us. we expect that the operations and results of mwspc will be, and the operations or
33
results of some of the other joint ventures or companies are, significant to us, and their operations can affect our earnings. because we do not control these companies either at the board or stockholder levels and because local laws in foreign jurisdictions and contractual obligations may place restrictions on monetary distributions by these companies, we cannot ensure that these companies will operate efficiently (or, in the case of mwspc, in compliance with the terms of any future funding facility for which we may provide financial guarantees), pay dividends, or generally follow the desires of our management by virtue of our board or stockholder representation. as a result, these companies may contribute less than anticipated to our earnings and cash flow, negatively impacting our results of operations and liquidity. additionally, in the case of mwspc we may be called upon to provide funds to satisfy mwspc's debt obligations to the extent we provide financial guarantees in connection with future planned funding facilities as discussed above.
strikes or other forms of work stoppage or slowdown could disrupt our business and lead to increased costs.
our financial performance is dependent on a reliable and productive work force. a significant portion of our workforce, and that of the joint ventures in which we participate, is covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. unsuccessful contract negotiations or adverse labor relations could result in strikes or slowdowns. any disruptions may decrease our production and sales or impose additional costs to resolve disputes. the risk of adverse labor relations may increase as our profitability increases because labor unions' expectations and demands generally rise at those times.
accidents occurring in the course of our operating activities could result in significant liabilities, interruptions or shutdowns of facilities or the need for significant safety or other expenditures.
we engage in mining and industrial activities that can result in serious accidents. if our safety procedures are not effective, or if an accident occurs, we could be subject to liabilities arising out of personal injuries or death, our operations could be interrupted and we might have to shut down or abandon affected facilities. accidents could cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or to repair damaged facilities. for example:
•   some of our mines are subject to potential damage from earthquakes.
the excavation of mines can result in potential seismic events or can increase the likelihood or potential severity of a seismic event. the rise and fall of water levels, such as those arising from the brine inflows and our remediation activities at our esterhazy mine, can also result in or increase the likelihood or potential severity of a seismic event. our esterhazy mine has experienced minor seismic events from time to time. a significant seismic event at one of our mines could result in serious injuries or death, or damage to or flooding of the mine or, in the extreme scenario, cause us to change our mining process or abandon the mine.
•   our underground potash shaft mines are subject to risk from fire. in the event of a fire, if our emergency procedures are not successful, we could have significant injuries or deaths. in addition, fire at one of our underground shaft mines could halt our operations at the affected mine while we investigate the origin of the fire or for longer periods for remedial work or otherwise.
our underground potash shaft mines at esterhazy and colonsay, saskatchewan and carlsbad, new mexico are subject to risk from fire. any failure of our safety procedures in the future could result in serious injuries or death, or shutdowns, which could result in significant liabilities and/or impact on the financial performance of our potash business, including a possible material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.
•   we handle significant quantities of ammonia at several of our facilities. if our safety procedures are not effective, an accident involving our ammonia operations could result in serious injuries or death, or result in the shutdown of our facilities.
we produce ammonia at our faustina, louisiana phosphate concentrates plant, use ammonia in significant quantities at all of our florida and louisiana phosphates concentrates plants and store ammonia at some of our distribution facilities. for our florida phosphates concentrates plants, ammonia is received at terminals in tampa and transported by pipelines and rail to our facilities. our ammonia is generally stored and transported at high pressures or cryogenically. an accident could occur that could result in serious injuries or death, or the evacuation of areas near an accident. an accident could also result in property damage or the shutdown of our florida or louisiana phosphates concentrates plants, the ammonia terminals, pipelines or rail lines serving those plants or our other ammonia storage and handling facilities. as a result, an accident involving ammonia could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.
34
•   we also use or produce other hazardous or volatile chemicals at some of our facilities. if our safety procedures are not effective, an accident involving these other hazardous or volatile chemicals could result in serious injuries or death, or result in the shutdown of our facilities.
we use sulfuric acid in the production of concentrated phosphates in our florida and louisiana operations. some of our florida and louisiana facilities produce fluorosilicic acid, which is a hazardous chemical, for resale to third parties. we also use or produce other hazardous or volatile chemicals at some of our facilities. an accident involving any of these chemicals could result in serious injuries or death, or evacuation of areas near an accident. an accident could also result in property damage or shutdown of our facilities, or cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or to repair damaged facilities. as a result, an accident involving any of these chemicals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.
deliberate, malicious acts, including terrorism, could damage our facilities, disrupt our operations or injure employees, contractors, customers or the public and result in liability to us.
intentional acts of destruction could hinder our sales or production and disrupt our supply chain. our facilities could be damaged or destroyed, reducing our operational production capacity and requiring us to repair or replace our facilities at substantial cost. employees, contractors and the public could suffer substantial physical injury for which we could be liable. governmental authorities may impose security or other requirements that could make our operations more difficult or costly. the consequences of any such actions could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
we may be adversely affected by changing antitrust laws to which we are subject. increases in crop nutrient prices can increase the scrutiny to which we are subject under these laws.
we are subject to antitrust and competition laws in various countries throughout the world. we cannot predict how these laws or their interpretation, administration and enforcement will change over time. changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limit our existing or future operations and growth, or the operations of canpotex, which serves as an export association for our potash business. increases in crop nutrient prices have in the past resulted in increased scrutiny of the crop nutrient industry under antitrust and competition laws and can increase the risk that these laws could be interpreted, administered or enforced in a manner that could affect our operating practices or impose liability on us in a manner that could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
we may be adversely affected by other changes in laws resulting from increases in food and crop nutrient prices.
increases in prices for, among other things, food, fuel and crop inputs (including crop nutrients) have in the past been the subject of significant discussion by various governmental bodies and officials throughout the world. in response to increases, it is possible that governments in one or more of the locations in which we operate or where we or our competitors sell our products could take actions that could affect us. such actions could include, among other matters, changes in governmental policies relating to agriculture and biofuels (including changes in subsidy levels), price controls, tariffs, windfall profits taxes or export or import taxes. any such actions could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
our competitive position could be adversely affected if we are unable to participate in continuing industry consolidation.
most of our products are readily available from a number of competitors, and price and other competition in the crop nutrient industry is intense. in addition, crop nutrient production facilities and distribution activities frequently benefit from economies of scale. as a result, particularly during pronounced cyclical troughs, the crop nutrient industry has a long history of consolidation. mosaic itself is the result of a number of industry consolidations. we expect consolidation among crop nutrient producers could continue. our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through consolidations, acquisitions, joint ventures or partnerships. in the future, we may not be able to find suitable companies to combine with, assets to purchase or joint venture or partnership opportunities to pursue. even if we are able to locate desirable opportunities, we may not be able to enter into transactions on economically acceptable terms. if we do not successfully participate in continuing industry consolidation, our ability to compete successfully could be adversely affected and result in the loss of customers or an uncompetitive cost structure, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.
our strategy for managing market and interest rate risk may not be effective.
our businesses are affected by fluctuations in market prices for our products, the purchase price of natural gas, ammonia and sulfur consumed in operations, freight and shipping costs, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we periodically
35
enter into derivatives and forward purchase contracts to mitigate some of these risks. however, our strategy may not be successful in minimizing our exposure to these fluctuations. see "market risk" in our management's analysis and note 14 of our notes to consolidated financial statements that is incorporated by reference in this report in part ii, item 8.
a shortage or unavailability of railcars, tugs, barges and ships for carrying our products and the raw materials we use in our business could result in customer dissatisfaction, loss of production or sales and higher transportation or equipment costs.
we rely heavily upon truck, rail, tug, barge and ocean freight transportation to obtain the raw materials we need and to deliver our products to our customers. in addition, the cost of transportation is an important part of the final sale price of our products. finding affordable and dependable transportation is important in obtaining our raw materials and to supply our customers. higher costs for these transportation services or an interruption or slowdown due to factors including high demand, high fuel prices, labor disputes, layoffs or other factors affecting the availability of qualified transportation workers, adverse weather or other environmental events, or changes to rail, barge or ocean freight systems, could negatively affect our ability to produce our products or deliver them to our customers, which could affect our performance and results of operations.
strong demand for grain and other products and a strong world economy increase the demand for and reduce the availability of transportation, both domestically and internationally. shortages of railcars, barges and ocean transport for carrying product and increased transit time may result in customer dissatisfaction, loss of sales and higher equipment and transportation costs. in addition, during periods when the shipping industry has a shortage of ships the substantial time needed to build new ships prevents rapid market response. delays and missed shipments due to transportation shortages, including vessels, barges, railcars and trucks, could result in customer dissatisfaction or loss of sales potential, which could negatively affect our performance and results of operations.
additionally, we have agreed under our long-term cf ammonia supply agreement to purchase approximately 545,000 to 725,000 tonnes of ammonia per year beginning with 2017, during a term that may extend until december 31, 2032, at a price to be determined by a formula based on the prevailing price of u.s. natural gas. for 2017, our remaining minimum purchase obligation is approximately 410,000 tonnes following our entry into a separate arrangement with cf under which we were deemed to have purchased approximately 135,000 tonnes in exchange for providing ammonia storage space and use of related terminal facilities to cf. we will be obligated to provide for transportation of the ammonia under the agreement, and if we fail to take the required minimum annual amount, cf may elect to require us to make payment of liquidated damages or, with respect to such failures in years after 2017, terminate the agreement. payment of significant liquidated damages or an election by cf to terminate the agreement could adversely affect our business.
a lack of customers' access to credit can adversely affect their ability to purchase our products.
some of our customers require access to credit to purchase our products. a lack of available credit to customers in one or more countries, due to global or local economic conditions or for other reasons, could adversely affect demand for crop nutrients.
we extend trade credit to our customers and guarantee the financing that some of our customers use to purchase our products. our results of operations may be adversely affected if these customers are unable to repay the trade credit from us or financing from their banks. increases in prices for crop nutrient, other agricultural inputs and grain may increase this risk.
we extend trade credit to our customers in the united states and throughout the world, in some cases for extended periods of time. in brazil, where there are fewer third-party financing sources available to farmers, we also have several programs under which we guarantee customers' financing from financial institutions that they use to purchase our products. as our exposure to longer trade credit extended throughout the world and use of guarantees in brazil increases, we are increasingly exposed to the risk that some of our customers will not pay us or the amounts we have guaranteed. additionally, we become increasingly exposed to risk due to weather and crop growing conditions, fluctuations in commodity prices or foreign currencies, and other factors that influence the price, supply and demand for agricultural commodities. significant defaults by our customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
increases in prices for crop nutrients increase the dollar amount of our sales to customers. the larger dollar value of our customers' purchases may also lead them to request longer trade credit from us and/or increase their need for us to guarantee their financing of our products. either factor could increase the amount of our exposure to the risk that our customers may be unable to repay the trade credit from us or financing from their banks that we guarantee. in addition, increases in prices for
36
other agricultural inputs and grain may increase the working capital requirements, indebtedness and other liabilities of our customers, increase the risk that they will default on the trade credit from us or their financing that we guarantee, and decrease the likelihood that we will be able to collect from our customers in the event of their default.
tax rules governing the cargill transaction limited our ability to execute certain actions for a period of time following the cargill transaction and, if our procedures for compliance with those restrictions were ineffective, notwithstanding the irs ruling and tax opinion issued to cargill in connection with the cargill transaction, we could owe significant tax-related indemnification liabilities to cargill.
the irs issued a ruling to the effect that the split-off that was part of the cargill transaction would be tax-free to cargill and its stockholders, and in connection with the completion of the cargill transaction, cargill received a tax opinion relating to certain tax consequences of the cargill transaction. notwithstanding the irs ruling and tax opinion, however, the split-off and debt exchanges could be taxable to cargill and its stockholders under certain circumstances. therefore, we and cargill agreed to tax-related restrictions and indemnities set forth in a tax agreement related to the cargill transaction, under which we were restricted or deterred from taking certain actions until may 26, 2013, including (i) redeeming or purchasing our stock in excess of agreed-upon amounts; (ii) issuing any equity securities in excess of agreed upon amounts; (iii) approving or recommending a third party's acquisition of us; (iv) permitting any merger or other combination of mosaic or mos holdings inc.; and (v) entering into an agreement for the purchase of any interest in mosaic or mos holdings inc., subject to certain exceptions. we agreed to indemnify cargill for taxes and tax-related losses imposed on cargill as a result of the split-off and/or debt exchange failing to qualify as tax-free, if the taxes and related losses are attributable to, arise out of or result from certain prohibited acts or to any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty or covenant made by us in the tax agreement referred to above. the taxes and tax-related losses of cargill would be material if these transactions fail to qualify as tax-free, and, while we do not believe we engaged in any prohibited acts during the relevant period, if our procedures for avoiding any of these prohibited acts or breaches were ineffective, this indemnity would result in material liabilities from us to cargill that could have a material adverse effect on us. for a further discussion of the restrictions and indemnities set forth in the agreements related to the cargill transaction, please see note 18 to our notes to consolidated financial statements.
provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.
our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent and the inability of our stockholders to request that our board of directors or chairman of our board call a special meeting of stockholders.
we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law. in general, section 203 prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a "business combination" with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years from the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the interested stockholder attained this status with the approval of the board of directors or unless the business combination was approved in a prescribed manner. a "business combination" includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. subject to exceptions, an "interested stockholder" is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years owned, 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock. this statute could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts with respect to us and, accordingly, may discourage attempts to acquire us.
these provisions apply not only when they may protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics but even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our best interests or those of our stockholders.
our success will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and motivated employees.
we believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our employees. like many businesses, a significant number of our employees, including some of our most highly skilled employees with specialized expertise in potash and phosphates operations, will be approaching retirement age throughout the next decade and beyond. in addition, we compete for a talented workforce with other businesses, particularly within the mining and chemicals industries in general and the crop nutrients industry in particular. our expansion plans are highly dependent on our ability to attract, retain and train highly qualified and motivated employees who are essential to the success of our ongoing operations as well as to our
37
expansion plans. if we were to be unsuccessful in attracting, retaining and training the employees we require, our ongoing operations and expansion plans could be materially and adversely affected.
future product or technological innovation could affect our business.
future product or technological innovation such as the development of seeds that require less crop nutrients, the development of substitutes for our products or developments in the application of crop nutrients, if they occur, could have the potential to adversely affect the demand for our products and our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources.
our acquisition of the global phosphate and potash operations of vale s.a. ("vale") conducted through vale fertilizantes s.a. (the "transaction") is subject to review under antitrust laws and requires governmental approvals which could jeopardize completion of the acquisition or in some cases impose conditions on the acquisition that could have a material adverse effect on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction.
completion of the transaction is conditioned upon obtaining certain required governmental authorizations. there can be no assurance that the authorizations will be obtained, and we and the sellers are not obligated to accept any and all conditions imposed by governmental authorities in order to obtain such authorizations. in addition, the governmental authorities with or from which these authorizations are required have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations. as a condition to authorization of the acquisition, these governmental authorities may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on our conduct of the business after completion of the transaction. our acceptance of any such divestiture requests or other restrictions on operations could diminish the benefits of the transaction and result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other effects associated with restrictions on business operations.
in addition, at any time before or after completion of the acquisition, the antitrust division of the u.s. department of justice or the u.s. federal trade commission, any state or certain foreign governments could take various actions under antitrust, competition or similar laws, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the transaction or to rescind the transaction. private parties also may seek to take legal action under antitrust, competition or similar laws under certain circumstances. a challenge to the transaction on antitrust, competition or similar grounds may be made by any of these governmental or private parties and, if such a challenge is made, it is possible that we and the sellers will not prevail.
the transaction is also subject to additional risks, contingencies and uncertainties that could result in delays to completion of the transaction, in the failure of the transaction to be completed or in our inability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of the transaction.
completion of the transaction is subject to certain additional closing conditions, including (i) the timely completion of restructuring transactions by the sellers, including the transfer of vale fertilizantes s.a.'s cubatão business to vale and its affiliates; (ii) the achievement of certain additional specified regulatory and operational milestones; and (iii) the absence of governmental actions due to the recent water loss incident at our new wales, florida facility that result in a reduction or suspension of operations or increased operating costs at the facility and would be reasonably be expected to materially adversely impact mosaic and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. any failure to satisfy these conditions could result in delays to completion of the transaction or in the failure of the transaction to be completed.
there are also additional risks, contingencies and uncertainties associated with the transaction, including:
•   the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the right of a party to terminate the acquisition agreement;
•   that we may not be able to secure financing, or financing on satisfactory terms and in amounts sufficient to fund the cash portion of the purchase price without utilizing our other liquidity sources;
•   that we will continue to incur additional costs and expend significant additional time and effort prior to the closing of the transaction, and if the transaction is delayed or not completed we may not be able to realize any benefit therefrom;
•   possible distraction of our management from ongoing business operations due to the transaction or the integration of vale fertilizantes following the transaction;
•   the impact of the issuance of our common stock as consideration in the transaction on our current stockholders, including dilution of their ownership and voting interests; and
38
•   difficulties realizing the anticipated benefits, cost savings or synergies of the transaction, including the risks that: the acquired business may not be integrated successfully or integration involves higher than projected costs, that we have underestimated the liabilities and obligations we are assuming in the transaction, or that the anticipated synergies or cost or capital expenditure savings from the transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including because of political and economic instability in brazil or changes in government regulation or policy in brazil, or because the combined operations do not perform as expected.
the success of our other strategic initiatives depends on our ability to effectively manage these initiatives, and to successfully integrate and grow acquired businesses.
in addition to the transaction, we have other significant ongoing strategic initiatives including, principally our plans to expand the annual production capacity of our potash business and mwspc. these strategic initiatives involve capital and other expenditures of several billions of dollars over a number of years and require effective project management and, in the case of strategic acquisitions, successful integration. to the extent the processes we (or, for the mwspc, we together with ma'aden and sabic) put in place to manage these initiatives or integrate and grow acquired businesses are not effective, our capital expenditure and other costs may exceed our expectations or the benefits we expect from these initiatives might not be fully realized.
we may fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of our long-term cf ammonia supply agreement.
we use ammonia as a raw material in the production of our concentrated phosphate products. under our long-term cf ammonia supply agreement we have agreed to purchase approximately 545,000 to 725,000 tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that may extend until december 31, 2032 at a price to be determined by a formula based on the prevailing price of u.s. natural gas.
the success of this agreement will depend, in part, on our ability to realize cost savings from the agreement's natural gas based pricing. if the price of natural gas rises materially or the market price for ammonia falls outside of the range we currently anticipate over the term of the agreement, we may not realize a cost benefit from the agreement, or the cost of our ammonia under the agreement could be a competitive disadvantage. in addition, our ability to realize benefits and cost savings is subject to certain additional risks including whether cf successfully performs its obligations under the agreement over the life of its commitment and our ability to take delivery of the required minimum annual amount of ammonia over the life of our commitment. we discuss the risks associated with our obligations under this agreement in more detail earlier in this risk factors section.
cyber attacks could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business.
as a global company, we utilize and rely upon information technology systems in many aspects of our business, including internal and external communications and the management of our accounting, financial, production and supply chain functions.  as we become more dependent on information technologies to conduct our operations, and as the number and sophistication of cyber attacks increase, the risks associated with cyber security increase.  these risks apply both to us, and to third parties on whose systems we rely for the conduct of our business.  failure to effectively anticipate, prevent, detect and recover from the increasing number and sophistication of cyber attacks could result in theft, loss or misuse of, or damage or modification of our information, and cause disruptions or delays in our business, reputational damage and third-party claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

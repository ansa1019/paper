item 1a. risk factors our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks, including those discussed below, which may affect the value of our securities. the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant to our business.
we have customer concentration with the u.s. government; reduction in u.s. government defense spending may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
during 2016, we derived approximately 25% of our revenues from sales to a variety of u.s. government entities.  our revenues from the u.s. government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various u.s. government defense-related programs. the funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions and the u.s. government budget process which includes enacting relevant legislation, such as appropriations bills and accords on the debt ceiling. although multiple-year contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements, congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years. consequently, programs often are only partially funded initially, and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations.  if we incur costs in advance or in excess of funds committed on a contract, we are at risk for non-reimbursement of those costs until additional funds are appropriated.  the reduction, termination or delay in the timing of funding for u.s. government programs for which we currently provide or propose to provide products or services may result in a loss of anticipated future revenues that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. significant changes in national and international policies or priorities for defense spending could impact the funding, or the timing of funding, of our programs, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
under the budget control act of 2011, the u.s. government committed to significantly reduce the federal deficit over ten years. as a result, long-term funding for various programs in which we participate, as well as future purchasing decisions by our u.s. government customers, could be reduced, delayed or cancelled. in addition, these cuts could adversely affect the viability of the suppliers and subcontractors under our programs. there are many variables in how these budget cuts could be implemented that make it difficult to determine specific impacts; however, we expect that sequestration, as currently provided for under the budget control act, would result in lower revenues, profits and cash flows for our company. such circumstances may also result in an impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets.  because our u.s. government contracts generally require us to continue to perform even if the u.s. government is unable to make timely payments; if, for example, the debt ceiling is not raised, and, as a result, our customer does not pay us on a timely basis, we may need to finance our continued performance of the impacted contracts from our other resources on an interim basis. an extended delay in the timely payment by the u.s. government could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
u.s. government contracts may be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions.
the u.s. government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract.  in the event of termination for the u.s. governments convenience, contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed.  a termination arising out of our default for failure to perform could expose us to liability, including but not limited to, all costs incurred under the contract plus potential liability for re-procurement costs in excess of the total original contract amount, less the value of work performed and accepted by the customer under the contract.  such an event could also have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. if any of our contracts are terminated by the u.s. government whether for convenience or default, our backlog and anticipated revenues would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts.  we also enter into
10
fee for service contracts with the u.s. government where we retain ownership of, and consequently the risk of loss on, aircraft and equipment supplied to perform under these contracts.  termination of these contracts could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. on contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the u.s. government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor.  in addition, in the event that the u.s. government is unable to make timely payments, failure to continue contract performance places the contractor at risk of termination for default.  any such event could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
as a u.s. government contractor, we are subject to procurement rules and regulations.
we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of u.s. government contracts. these laws and regulations, among other things, require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation, define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based u.s. government contracts, and safeguard and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information, covered defense information, and the exportation of certain products and technical data. our u.s. government contracts contain provisions that allow the u.s. government to unilaterally suspend or debar us from receiving new contracts for a period of time, reduce the value of existing contracts, issue modifications to a contract, and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products, services and associated materials.  a number of our u.s. government contracts contain provisions that require us to make disclosure to the inspector general of the agency that is our customer if we have credible evidence that we have violated u.s. criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, or bribery; the u.s. civil false claims act; or received a significant overpayment under a u.s. government contract. failure to properly and timely make disclosures under these provisions may result in a termination for default or cause, suspension and/or debarment, and potential fines.
as a u.s. government contractor, our businesses and systems are subject to audit and review by the defense contract audit agency (dcaa) and the defense contract management agency (dcma).
we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the u.s. government and its agencies such as dcaa and dcma. these agencies review our performance under contracts, our cost structure and our compliance with laws and regulations applicable to u.s. government contractors. the systems that are subject to review include, but are not limited to, our accounting, estimating, material management and accounting, earned value management, purchasing and government property systems. if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions that may include the termination of our contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and, under certain circumstances, suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time. whether or not illegal activities are alleged, the u.s. government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate.  these laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our government customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business.
cost overruns on u.s. government contracts could subject us to losses or adversely affect our future business.
under fixed-price contracts, as a general rule, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur, and, consequently, any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us. changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates used in developing the pricing for such contracts may adversely affect our results of operations. additionally, u.s. government procurement policies increasingly favor fixed-price incentive-based fee arrangements rather than traditional fixed-price contracts; these fee arrangements could negatively impact our profitability. other current u.s. government policies could negatively impact our working capital and cash flow. for example, the government has expressed a preference for requiring progress payments rather than performance based payments on new fixed-price contracts, which if implemented, delays our ability to recover a significant amount of costs incurred on a contract and thus affects the timing of our cash flows.  under time and materials contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. under cost-reimbursement contracts that are subject to a contract-ceiling amount, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee, which may be fixed or performance based, however, if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs. under each type of contract, if we are unable to control costs incurred in performing under the contract, our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards.
demand for our aircraft products is cyclical and could adversely affect our financial results.
demand for business jets, turbo props and commercial helicopters has been cyclical and difficult to forecast. therefore, future demand for these products could be significantly and unexpectedly less than anticipated and/or less than previous period deliveries. similarly, there is uncertainty as to when or whether our existing commercial backlog for aircraft products will convert to revenues as the conversion depends on production capacity, customer needs and credit availability. changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or cancelled. reduced demand for our aircraft products or delays or cancellations of orders could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
11
we may make acquisitions that increase the risks of our business.
we may enter into acquisitions in an effort to expand our business and enhance shareholder value. acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties that could result in our not achieving expected benefits.  such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner; challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits; the risk that the acquired businesses markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the acquired businesses products and technologies do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets; the risk that our due diligence reviews of the acquired business do not identify or adequately assess all of the material issues which impact valuation of the business or that may result in costs or liabilities in excess of what we anticipated; the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited; the risk that the acquired business may have significant internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions; and the potential loss of key customers, suppliers and employees of the acquired businesses.  in addition, unanticipated delays or difficulties in effecting acquisitions may prevent the consummation of the acquisition or divert the attention of our management and resources from our existing operations.
if our finance segment is unable to maintain portfolio credit quality, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
a key determinant of the financial performance of our finance segment is the quality of loans, leases and other assets in its portfolio. portfolio quality may be adversely affected by several factors, including finance receivable underwriting procedures, collateral value, geographic or industry concentrations, and the effect of general economic conditions. in addition, a majority of the new originations in our finance receivable portfolio are cross-border transactions for aircraft sold outside of the u.s.  cross-border transactions present additional challenges and risks in realizing upon collateral in the event of borrower default, which may result in difficulty or delay in collecting on the related finance receivables.  if our finance segment has difficulty successfully collecting its finance receivable portfolio, our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
we may need to obtain financing in the future; such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.
we may periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due, to support our operations and/or to make acquisitions. our access to the debt capital markets and the cost of borrowings are affected by a number of factors including market conditions and the strength of our credit ratings. if we cannot obtain adequate sources of credit on favorable terms, or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
failure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance.
we rely on other companies to provide raw materials, major components and subsystems for our products. subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances. we depend on these suppliers and subcontractors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations. our ability to meet our obligations to our customers may be adversely affected if suppliers or subcontractors do not provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and cost-effective manner. likewise, the quality of our products may be adversely impacted if companies to whom we delegate manufacture of major components or subsystems for our products, or from whom we acquire such items, do not provide components or subsystems which meet required specifications and perform to our and our customers expectations. our suppliers may be less likely than us to be able to quickly recover from natural disasters and other events beyond their control and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations. the risk of these adverse effects may be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular raw material, product or service. in particular, in the aircraft industry, most vendor parts are certified by the regulatory agencies as part of the overall type certificate for the aircraft being produced by the manufacturer. if a vendor does not or cannot supply its parts, then the manufacturers production line may be stopped until the manufacturer can design, manufacture and certify a similar part itself or identify and certify another similar vendors part, resulting in significant delays in the completion of aircraft. such events may adversely affect our financial results, damage our reputation and relationships with our customers, and result in regulatory actions and/or litigation.
our business could be negatively impacted by information technology disruptions and security threats.
our information technology (it) and related systems are critical to the smooth operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day to day operations.  from time to time, we update and/or replace it systems used by our businesses.  the implementation of new systems can present temporary disruptions of business activities as existing processes are transitioned to the new systems, resulting in productivity issues, including delays in production, shipments or other business operations.  in addition, we outsource certain support functions, including certain global it infrastructure services, to third-party service providers. any disruption of such outsourced processes or functions also could have a material adverse impact on our operations.  in addition, as a u.s. defense contractor, we face certain security threats, including threats to our it infrastructure, unlawful attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information and threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, as do our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and joint venture partners.  cybersecurity threats, such as malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential, classified or otherwise proprietary information or that of our employees or customers, as well as other security breaches, are persistent, continue to evolve and require highly skilled it resources.  while we have experienced cybersecurity attacks, we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks, and we believe our threat detection and
12
mitigation processes and procedures are robust.  due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the possibility of future material incidents cannot be completely mitigated. an it system failure, issues related to implementation of new it systems or breach of data security, whether of our systems or the systems of our service providers or other third parties who may have access to our data for business purposes, could disrupt our operations, cause the loss of business information or compromise confidential information. such an incident also could require significant management attention and resources and increased costs, and could adversely affect our competitiveness and our results of operations.
developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties.
to continue to grow our revenues and segment profit, we must successfully develop new products and technologies or modify our existing products and technologies for our current and future markets. our future performance depends, in part, on our ability to identify emerging technological trends and customer requirements and to develop and maintain competitive products and services. delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products, or certification of new aircraft and other products, could affect our results of operations. these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles, production changes to meet customer demands, unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft or other products, coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed. we also could be adversely affected if our research and development investments are less successful than expected or if we do not adequately protect the intellectual property developed through these efforts. likewise, new products and technologies could generate unanticipated safety or other concerns resulting in expanded product liability risks, potential product recalls and other regulatory issues that could have an adverse impact on us. furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. a reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, the market for our product offerings may not develop or continue to expand as we currently anticipate. furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain superior market acceptance compared to our products.  a significant failure in our new product development efforts or the failure of our products or services to achieve market acceptance relative to our competitors products or services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries.
during 2016, we derived approximately 38% of our revenues from international business, including u.s. exports, and we expect international revenues to continue to increase. conducting business internationally exposes us to additional risks than if we conducted our business solely within the u.s. we maintain manufacturing facilities, service centers, supply centers and other facilities worldwide, including in various emerging market countries.  we also have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, joint venture arrangements in emerging market countries, some of which may require capital investment, guaranties or other commitments.  risks related to international operations include import, export and other trade restrictions; changing u.s. and foreign procurement policies and practices; restrictions on technology transfer; difficulties in protecting intellectual property; increasing complexity of employment and environmental, health and safety regulations; foreign investment laws; exchange controls; repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges, competition from foreign and multinational firms with home country advantages; economic and government instability, acts of terrorism and related safety concerns.  the impact of any one or more of these or other factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.
additionally, some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific in-country purchases, technology transfers, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known as offsets, as a condition for a contract award. the contracts generally extend over several years and may include penalties if we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements which are often subjective. we also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs. in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the foreign corrupt practices act. although we maintain policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, a violation of such laws by any of our international representatives, consultants, joint ventures, business partners, subcontractors or suppliers, even if prohibited by our policies, could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.
we are subject to increasing compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results.
as a global business, we are subject to laws and regulations in the u.s. and other countries in which we operate. our increased focus on international sales and global operations requires importing and exporting goods and technology, some of which have military applications subjecting them to more stringent import-export controls across international borders on a regular basis. for example, we sometimes initially must obtain licenses and authorizations from various u.s. government agencies before we are permitted to sell certain of our aerospace and defense products outside the u.s. both u.s. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us have been increasing in scope and complexity. for example, both u.s. and foreign governments and government agencies regulate the
13
aviation industry, and they may impose new regulations with additional aircraft security or other requirements or restrictions, including, for example, restrictions and/or fees related to carbon emissions levels. changes in environmental laws and regulations, including those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as green initiatives, could lead to the necessity for new or additional investment in product designs or manufacturing processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures, including costs to defend regulatory reviews. new or changing laws and regulations or related interpretation and policies could increase our costs of doing business, affect how we conduct our operations, adversely impact demand for our products, and/or limit our ability to sell our products and services. compliance with laws and regulations of increasing scope and complexity is even more challenging in our current business environment in which reducing our operating costs is often necessary to remain competitive. in addition, a violation of u.s. and/or foreign laws by one of our employees or business partners could subject us or our employees to civil or criminal penalties, including material monetary fines, or other adverse actions, such as denial of import or export privileges and/or debarment as a government contractor which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business.
we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims.
we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business, including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions; government contracts; alleged lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations; production partners; product liability; patent and trademark infringement; employment disputes; and environmental, safety and health matters.  due to the nature of our manufacturing business, we may be subject to liability claims arising from accidents involving our products, including claims for serious personal injuries or death caused by weather or by pilot, driver or user error. in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable, it is reasonably possible that such claims could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable. in addition, we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate and that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial claims. furthermore, we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and costs in the future.  litigation is inherently unpredictable, and we could incur judgments, receive adverse arbitration awards or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our financial position or our results of operations in any particular period.
intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers.
intellectual property infringement claims may be asserted by third parties against us or our customers. any related indemnification payments or legal costs we may be obliged to pay on behalf of our businesses, our customers or other third parties could be costly. in addition, we own the rights to many patents, trademarks, brand names, trade names and trade secrets that are important to our business. the inability to enforce these intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. additionally, our intellectual property could be at risk due to various cybersecurity threats.
certain of our products are subject to laws regulating consumer products and could be subject to repurchase or recall as a result of safety issues.
as a distributor of consumer products in the u.s., certain of our products also are subject to the consumer product safety act, which empowers the u.s. consumer product safety commission (cpsc) to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous. under certain circumstances, the cpsc could require us to repair, replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products, or potentially even discontinue entire product lines, or we may voluntarily do so, but within strictures recommended by the cpsc. the cpsc also can impose fines or penalties on a manufacturer for non-compliance with its requirements. furthermore, failure to timely notify the cpsc of a potential safety hazard can result in significant fines being assessed against us. any repurchases or recalls of our products or an imposition of fines or penalties could be costly to us and could damage the reputation or the value of our brands. additionally, laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states, as well as in other countries in which we sell our products, and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future.
the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results.
our earnings and cash flow may be adversely impacted by the amount of income or expense we expend or record for employee benefit plans. this is particularly true for our defined benefit pension plans, where required contributions to those plans and related expenses are driven by, among other things, our assumptions of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate used for future payment obligations and the rates of future cost growth. additionally, as part of our annual evaluation of these plans, significant changes in our assumptions, due to changes in economic, legislative and/or demographic experience or circumstances, or changes in our actual investment returns could negatively impact the funded status of our plans requiring us to substantially increase our pension liability with a resulting decrease in shareholders equity. also, changes in pension legislation and regulations could increase the cost associated with our defined benefit pension plans.
14
our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues.
approximately 7,300, or 28%, of our u.s. employees are unionized, and many of our non-u.s. employees are represented by organized councils. as a result, we may experience work stoppages, which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis, resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers and a loss of revenues. the presence of unions also may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace. in addition, the workforces of many of our suppliers and customers are represented by labor unions. work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes; similar actions at the plants of our customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products. any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations.
currency, raw material price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results.
we are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, raw material prices and interest rates. currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions. accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency rates could adversely affect our profitability in future periods. we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program. in some cases, we purchase derivatives or enter into contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations. nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, raw material prices and interest rates can have substantial adverse effects on our results of operations.
we may be unable to effectively mitigate pricing pressures.
in some markets, particularly where we deliver component products and services to oems, we face ongoing customer demands for price reductions, which sometimes are contractually obligated. however, if we are unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures through technological advances or by lowering our cost base through improved operating and supply chain efficiencies, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and various non-u.s. jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the location of income among these different jurisdictions. our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore, changes to unrecognized tax benefits or changes in tax laws, which could affect our profitability. in particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income, as well as changes to applicable statutory tax rates.  in addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability.
item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and consolidated results of operations in 2016, revenues and segment profit grew by 3% and 4%, respectively, despite challenging and weaker than expected end markets, most notably the business jet and commercial helicopter markets.  we continued to invest in our businesses through the ongoing development of new products and services, and the completion of several strategic business acquisitions to support growth and create long-term shareholder value.  financial highlights of 2016 include the following:
·     generated $988 million in cash from operating activities of our manufacturing businesses.
·     invested $677 million in research and development activities, $446 million in capital expenditures and $186 million in business acquisitions.
·     returned $263 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments.
·     initiated a plan to restructure and realign our businesses to improve overall operating efficiency and to better position our businesses for the future, which resulted in special charges of $123 million.
an analysis of our consolidated operating results is set forth below.  a more detailed analysis of our segments operating results is provided in the segment analysis section on pages 21 to 28.

revenues increased $365 million, 3%, in 2016, compared with 2015, largely driven by increases in the industrial, textron systems and textron aviation segments, partially offset by lower revenues at the bell segment.  the net revenue increase included the following factors:
·     higher industrial revenues of $250 million, primarily due to higher volume of $168 million, largely in the fuel systems and functional components product line, and the impact from acquired businesses of $121 million.
·     higher textron systems revenues of $236 million, primarily due to higher volume of $106 million in the marine and land systems product line and $77 million in the unmanned systems product line.
·     higher textron aviation revenues of $99 million, primarily due to the impact from an acquired business of $66 million and higher volume and mix of $42 million, largely the result of higher citation jet volume of $165 million, partially offset by lower turboprop volume.
·     lower bell revenues of $215 million, primarily due to a decrease in commercial revenues of $269 million, largely reflecting lower aircraft deliveries.
revenues decreased $455 million, 3%, in 2015, compared with 2014, as decreases in the bell and textron systems segments were partially offset by higher revenues in the textron aviation and industrial segments.  the net revenue decrease included the following factors:
·     lower bell revenues of $791 million, largely due to a decrease of $577 million in v-22 program revenues, primarily reflecting lower aircraft deliveries, a decrease of $193 million in commercial revenues, largely related to a change in mix of commercial aircraft sold during the period, and lower commercial aftermarket volume of $92 million.
·     lower textron systems revenues of $104 million, primarily due to lower volume in the unmanned systems product line, largely reflecting lower deliveries in the fourth quarter.
·     higher textron aviation revenues of $254 million, primarily due to the first quarter impact of the beechcraft acquisition of $219 million and higher volume and mix of $35 million. we completed the acquisition of beechcraft on march 14, 2014, and as a result, 2014 does not reflect a full twelve months of its revenues.
·     higher industrial segment revenues of $206 million, primarily due to higher volume of $357 million, largely in the fuel systems and functional components product line, and the impact from acquisitions of $103 million, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $240 million.

in 2016, cost of sales increased $332 million, 3%, compared with 2015, largely due to higher volume at the textron systems, industrial and textron aviation segments, and an increase from acquired businesses.  these increases were partially offset by lower volume at the bell segment and favorable cost performance across all of our manufacturing segments.  selling and administrative expense was unchanged in 2016, compared with 2015.
cost of sales decreased $442 million, 4%, in 2015, compared with 2014, largely due to lower volume at the bell segment and a $217 million favorable foreign exchange impact mostly from the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro, partially offset by higher volume at the industrial segment, and an increase from acquired businesses, primarily beechcraft.  the 60 basis-point improvement in gross margin was largely driven by the textron aviation segment, primarily reflecting the net impact of the beechcraft acquisition, which includes the benefit of the integrated cost structure of beechcraft and cessna, and lower amortization of fair value step-up adjustments related to acquired beechcraft inventories.
selling and administrative expense decreased $57 million, 4%, in 2015, compared with 2014.  significant factors contributing to the decrease in expense include a favorable impact from ongoing cost reduction activities at the bell segment and lower share-based compensation expense of $22 million, which were partially offset by an increase from acquired businesses, primarily beechcraft.

in 2016, we initiated a plan to restructure and realign our businesses by implementing headcount reductions, facility consolidations and other actions in order to improve overall operating efficiency across textron. as part of this plan, textron systems will discontinue production of its sensor-fuzed weapon product by the end of the first quarter of 2017, resulting in headcount reductions, facility consolidations and asset impairments within its weapons and sensors operating unit. historically, sensor-fuzed weapon sales have relied on foreign military and direct commercial international customers for which both executive branch and congressional approval is required. the political environment has made it difficult to obtain these approvals. within our industrial segment, the plan provides for the combination of our jacobsen business with the textron specialized vehicles businesses, resulting in the consolidation of certain facilities and general and administrative functions and related headcount reductions.  in addition, we initiated restructuring actions, principally headcount reductions, in our textron aviation segment, as well as other businesses and corporate
20
functions.  the total headcount reduction related to restructuring activities is expected to be approximately 1,700 positions, representing approximately 5% of our workforce.
we expect to incur additional pre-tax charges under this plan in the range of $17 million to $47 million, primarily related to contract termination, severance, facility consolidation and relocation costs. the remaining charges are expected to primarily be in the industrial, textron systems and textron aviation segments.  we anticipate the plan to be substantially completed by the end of the first half of 2017.  total expected cash outlays for restructuring activities are estimated to be approximately $100 million to $120 million, of which $22 million was paid in 2016 and the remainder will be paid in 2017.
in 2014, we executed a restructuring program in our textron aviation segment to align the cessna and acquired beechcraft business, reduce operating redundancies and maximize operating efficiencies.  we recorded special charges of $41 million related to these restructuring activities in 2014, along with $11 million of transaction costs from the acquisition of beechcraft.

in 2016, our effective tax rate was significantly lower than the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, largely due to a settlement with the u.s. internal revenue service office of appeals for our 1998 to 2008 tax years.  this settlement resulted in a $206 million benefit recognized in continuing operations and a $113 million benefit in discontinued operations.  for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 35% see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
segment analysis we operate in, and report financial information for, the following five business segments: textron aviation, bell, textron systems, industrial and finance.  segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decision-making purposes. segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense, certain corporate expenses and special charges.  the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense along with intercompany interest income and expense.
in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group, changes in revenues and segment profit typically are expressed for our commercial business in terms of volume, pricing, foreign exchange and acquisitions.  additionally, changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix, inflation and cost performance. volume changes in revenues represent increases/decreases in the number of units delivered or services provided.  pricing represents changes in unit pricing.  foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreign-denominated amounts into u.s. dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period.  revenues generated by acquired businesses are reflected in acquisitions for a twelve-month period.  for segment profit, mix represents a change due to the composition of products and/or services sold at different profit margins.  inflation represents higher material, wages, benefits, pension or other costs.  performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development, depreciation, selling and administrative costs, warranty, product liability, quality/scrap, labor efficiency, overhead, product line profitability, start-up, ramp up and cost-reduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs.
approximately 25% of our 2016 revenues were derived from contracts with the u.s. government.  for our segments that have significant contracts with the u.s. government, we typically express changes in segment profit related to the government business in terms of volume, changes in program performance or changes in contract mix. changes in volume that are described in net sales typically drive corresponding changes in our segment profit based on the profit rate for a particular contract. changes in program performance typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance or award fee rates. changes in contract mix refers to changes in operating margin due to a change in the relative volume of contracts with higher or lower fee rates such that the overall average margin rate for the segment changes.

·                $193 million decrease in commercial revenues, largely related to a change in mix of commercial aircraft sold during the period, reflecting lower sales activity across the commercial helicopter market, and $92 million of lower aftermarket volume.  bell delivered 175 commercial aircraft in 2015, compared with 178 aircraft in 2014.
·                $21 million decrease in other military, which included $41 million recorded in the second quarter of 2014 related to the settlement of the sdd phase of the arh program.  bell delivered 24 h-1 aircraft in both periods.
bells operating expenses decreased $662 million, 18%, in 2015, compared with 2014, primarily due to lower net sales volume as described above and the favorable impact of ongoing cost reduction activities.
as a result of cost reduction actions announced in april 2015, bell incurred approximately $40 million in severance and benefit costs during the second quarter of 2015.  the initial impact of the restructuring on bells segment profit in the second quarter of 2015 was not significant due to cost savings from headcount reductions and the impact of including a portion of these costs in our indirect cost rates. these actions reduced bells headcount by approximately 1,100 employees representing approximately 12% of the bell workforce at that time.

industrial segment revenues increased $206 million, 6%, in 2015, compared with 2014, primarily due to higher volume of $357 million and the impact from acquisitions of $103 million, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $240 million mostly related to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar primarily against the euro.  higher volume reflected a $283 million increase in the fuel systems and functional components product line, primarily due to automotive industry demand in europe and north america, and a $74 million increase in the other industrial product lines.
operating expenses for the industrial segment increased $184 million, 6%, in 2015, compared with 2014, largely due to the impact from higher volume as described above and additional operating expenses from acquisitions of $105 million, partially offset by a favorable impact of $225 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

liquidity and capital resources our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups.  the manufacturing group consists of textron consolidated with its majority-owned subsidiaries that operate in the textron aviation, bell, textron systems and industrial segments.  the finance group, which also is the finance segment, consists of textron financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.  we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group.  our manufacturing group operations include the development, production and delivery of tangible goods and services, while our finance group provides financial services.  due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing groups activities, investors, rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each groups performance.  to support those evaluations, we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements.
key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below:

we believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing (i.e., leverage) that is in place to support our capital structure, as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage.  we believe that we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs, based on our existing cash balances, the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations and other available funding alternatives, as appropriate.
in 2016, textron entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in september 2021 for an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion, of which up to $100 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit.  at december 31, 2016, there were no amounts borrowed against the facility and there were $11 million of letters of credit issued against it.  this facility replaced the existing 5-year facility, which had no outstanding borrowings and was scheduled to expire in october 2018.
we also maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities.  in march 2016, we issued $350 million in 4.0% notes due march 2026 under this registration statement.
manufacturing group cash flows cash flows from continuing operations for the manufacturing group as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below:
(in millions)          2016          2015           2014

financing activities        (146)         (308)             552
in 2016, cash flows provided by operating activities was $988 million, compared with $1,038 million in 2015, a 5% decrease.  this decrease was primarily the result of changes in working capital, which included lower customer deposits of $257 million largely related to performance-based payments on certain military contracts in the bell segment, along with a $34 million reduction in dividends received from the finance group. these decreases were partially offset by a $75 million increase in cash proceeds from the settlements of corporate-owned life insurance policies and $42 million in lower payments for taxes and pension contributions as disclosed below.
cash flows provided by operating activities was $1,038 million in 2015, compared with $1,097 million in 2014, a 5% decrease.  this decrease was largely due to a change in working capital, partially offset by higher income from continuing operations of $94 million

and dividends received from the finance group of $63 million in 2015.  a significant factor contributing to the decrease in cash flows related to working capital was a reduction in customer deposits of $304 million at textron aviation, largely reflecting advance deposits received on military contracts in 2014 for 2015 deliveries.
net tax payments were $163 million, $187 million and $266 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. pension contributions were $50 million, $68 million and $76 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
investing cash flows included capital expenditures of $446 million, $420 million and $429 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  investing cash flows also included cash used for acquisitions of $186 million and $81 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, as well as a $1.5 billion aggregate cash payment to acquire beechcraft in 2014.
total financing cash flows included proceeds from long-term debt of $345 million in 2016 and $1.4 billion in 2014, most of which was used to finance a portion of the beechcraft acquisition.  in 2016, 2015 and 2014, financing activities also included the repayment of outstanding debt of $254 million, $100 million and $559 million, respectively.
share repurchases under a 2013 share repurchase authorization, we repurchased an aggregate of 6.9 million, 5.2 million and 8.9 million shares of our outstanding common stock in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for $241 million, $219 million and $340 million, respectively.
on january 25, 2017, we announced the adoption of a new plan authorizing the repurchase of up to 25 million shares under which we intend to purchase shares of textron common stock to offset the impact of dilution from share-based compensation and benefit plans and for opportunistic capital management purposes.  this new plan has no expiration date and replaced the existing plan adopted in 2013 that had 4.0 million remaining shares available for repurchase.
dividends dividend payments to shareholders totaled $22 million, $22 million and $28 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
dividends from the finance group are included within cash flows from operating activities for the manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment.  dividends paid by the finance group were $29 million and $63 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

the finance groups cash flows from operating activities included net tax payments of $11 million, $11 million and $23 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
cash flows from investing activities primarily included collections on finance receivables totaling $292 million, $351 million and $456 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, partially offset by finance receivable originations of $173 million, $194 million and $215 million, respectively.
cash used in financing activities included payments on long-term and nonrecourse debt of $203 million, $256 million and $345 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were partially offset by proceeds from long-term debt of $180 million, $61 million and $128 million, respectively. in 2016 and 2015, dividend payments to the manufacturing group totaled $29 million and $63 million, respectively.

in 2016, cash flows provided by operating activities was $1,014 million, compared with $1,094 million in 2015, a 7% decrease.   this decrease was primarily the result of changes in working capital, which included lower customer deposits of $257 million largely related to performance-based payments on certain military contracts in the bell segment. these decreases were partially offset by a $75 million increase in cash proceeds from the settlements of corporate-owned life insurance policies and $42 million in lower payments for taxes and pension contributions as disclosed below.
cash flows provided by operating activities was $1,094 million in 2015, compared with $1,211 million in 2014, a 10% decrease.  this decrease was largely due to a change in working capital, partially offset by higher income from continuing operations of $93 million. a significant factor contributing to the decrease in cash flows related to working capital was a reduction in customer deposits of $304 million at textron aviation, largely reflecting advance deposits received on military contracts in 2014 for 2015 deliveries.
net tax payments were $174 million, $198 million and $289 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. pension contributions were $50 million, $68 million and $76 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

in 2016, 2015 and 2014, cash used in financing activities included the repayment of outstanding long-term debt of $457 million, $356 million and $904 million, respectively, and share repurchases of $241 million, $219 million and $340 million, respectively.  total financing cash flows also included proceeds from long-term debt of $525 million and $61 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $1.6 billion in 2014, most of which was used to finance a portion of the beechcraft acquisition.
captive financing and other intercompany transactions the finance group provides financing primarily to purchasers of new and pre-owned textron aviation aircraft and bell helicopters manufactured by our manufacturing group, otherwise known as captive financing.  in the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash received from customers is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties.  however, in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups, cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group.  for example, when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group, the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance groups statement of cash flows.  meanwhile, in the manufacturing groups statement of cash flows, the cash received from the finance group on the customers behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow.  although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups, there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing.  these captive financing activities, along with all significant intercompany transactions, are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows.
reclassification adjustments included in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below:

pension and postretirement benefits we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans. actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors, including mortality assumptions, expected retirement age, rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates, which are subject to change in future years. our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually, consistent with applicable laws and regulations; however, future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table.  in 2017, we expect to make approximately $28 million of contributions to our funded pension plans and the retirement account plan. based on our current assumptions, which may change with changes in market conditions, our current contribution for each of the years from 2018 through 2021 are estimated to be in the range of approximately $75 million to $150 million under the plan provisions in place at this time.
other long-term liabilities other long-term liabilities consist of undiscounted amounts in the consolidated balance sheets that primarily include obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs. payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on managements assumptions of expected retirement age, mortality, stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals.  the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience. certain other long-term liabilities, such as deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits and product liability, warranty and litigation reserves, have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments.
purchase obligations purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price, quantity and delivery dates. approximately 38% of the purchase obligations we disclose represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the u.s. government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses.

critical accounting estimates to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies.  the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below.  we believe these policies require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties.  this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which includes other significant accounting policies.
long-term contracts we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to long-term contracts.  these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixed-price purchase options for additional products.  we account for these long-term contracts under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.  under this method, we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract.  the percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and, in some cases, includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications.  due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total contract costs and revenues through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years.  we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements, complexity of design and related development costs, product performance, performance of subcontractors, availability and cost of materials, labor productivity and cost, overhead and capital costs, manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones, including product deliveries, technical requirements, or schedule.
our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals.  we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change.  adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable.  anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable.  due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different revenues and/or cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change.  our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if (a) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment, (b) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation, (c) there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or (d) we are unable to meet contract milestones.
at the outset of each contract, we estimate the initial profit booking rate. the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements (for example, a newly-developed product versus a mature product), schedule (for example, the number and type of milestone events), and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion. profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule, and costs aspects of the contract. likewise, the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks; and, as a result, our estimated costs at completion increase. all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and, therefore, may affect the profit booking rate. when adjustments are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized using the cumulative catch-up method with the impact of the change from inception-to-date recorded in the current period.

goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings or cash flows, or material adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired.  the reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment, in which case such component is the reporting unit.  in certain instances, we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics.
we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit, primarily using discounted cash flows. these cash flows incorporate assumptions for short- and long-term revenue growth rates, operating margins and discount rates that represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions, cost structure, anticipated net cost reductions, and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a business having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed.  the revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts.  the long-term growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate, as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product, inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve.  we utilize a weighted-average cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit.  we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed.
if the reporting units estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment, and no further analysis is performed.  otherwise, the amount of the impairment is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill.  the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assigning a fair value to all of the reporting units assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
based on our annual impairment review, the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values, and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the initial step of the impairment test in the foreseeable future.
retirement benefits we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally.  these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations, which are calculated based on actuarial valuations.  key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost projections.  we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increases.  we evaluate and update these assumptions annually.
to determine the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class.  a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense.  for 2016, the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 7.58%, compared with 7.57% in 2015.  for the last five years, the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans, which represent approximately 91% of our total pension assets, was 7.75%.  a 50 basis-point decrease in this long-term rate of return in 2016 would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately $30 million.
the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date, reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled.  this rate should be in line with rates for high-quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits, which fluctuate as long-term interest rates change.  a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense.  in 2016, the weighted-average discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 4.66%, compared with 4.25% in 2015.  for our domestic plans, the
34
assumed discount rate was 4.75% in 2016, compared with 4.25% in 2015.  a 50 basis-point decrease in the weighted-average discount rate would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately $33 million in 2016.
the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate, and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities.  the 2016 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weighted-average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits.  in 2016, we assumed a trend rate of 7.25% for both medical and prescription drug healthcare rates and assumed this rate would gradually decline to 5.0% by 2024 and then remain at that level.  see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a one-percentage-point change in the cost trend rate.

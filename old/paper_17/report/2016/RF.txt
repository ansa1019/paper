risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes, the current u.s. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets, as well as counterparty risk. see the "portfolio characteristics" section found earlier in this report for further information regarding the loan portfolio. see further discussion of the current u.s. economic environment and counterparty risk below.
management process credit risk is managed by maintaining a sound credit risk culture, throughout all lines of defense, which ensures that the levels and types of risk taken are aligned with regions' credit risk appetite. the credit quality of borrowers and counterparties has a significant impact on regions' earnings; however, the nature of the risk differs by each of the defined businesses which engage in multiple forms of commercial, investor real estate and consumer lending. regions categorizes the credit risks it faces by asset quality, counterparty exposure, and diversification levels which provides a structure to assess credit risk and guides credit decision-making. credit policies, another key component of regions' culture, are designed and adjusted, as needed, to promote sound credit risk management.
these policies guide lending activities in a manner consistent with our strategy and provide a framework for achieving asset quality and earnings objectives.
effective credit risk management requires coordinated identification, measurement, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of credit risk exposure, credit quality, and emerging risk trends. accordingly, regions has implemented a credit risk governance structure that provides oversight from the board to the organizational units in order to maintain open channels of communication.
occasionally, borrowers and counterparties do not fulfill their obligations and regions must take steps to mitigate and manage losses. teams are in place to appropriately identify and manage nonperforming loans, collections, loan modifications, and loss mitigation efforts. regions maintains an allowance that management considers adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio.
for a discussion of the process and methodology used to calculate the allowance for credit losses refer to the
"critical accounting estimates and related policies" section found earlier in this report, and note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 6 "allowance for credit losses" to the consolidated financial statements.
details regarding the allowance for credit losses, including an analysis of activity from the previous year's total, are included in table 15 "allowance for credit losses." also, refer to table 16 "allocation of the allowance for loan losses" for details pertaining to management's allocation of the allowance for loan losses to each loan category.
responsibility and accountability for effectively managing all risks, including credit risk, in the various business units lies with the first line of defense. credit risk management, in the second line of defense, oversees, assesses and effectively challenges the risk-taking activities of the first line of defense. finally, credit risk review provides ongoing oversight, as a third line of defense function, of the credit portfolios to ensure regions' activities, and controls, are appropriate for the size, complexity and risk profile of the company.
economic environment in regions' banking markets one of the primary factors influencing the credit performance of regions' loan portfolio is the overall economic environment in the u.s. and the primary markets in which it operates. preliminary data shows the u.s. economy grew at a rate of just 1.5 percent in 2016, down from 2.6 percent in 2015 and below the average 2.1 percent annual growth realized since the end of the 2007 to 2009 recession. growth over the first half of 2016 was notably slow, due to weakness in business investment and residential fixed investment and the continuation of a persistent inventory correction. growth picked up considerably in the third quarter of 2016, with real gdp growth of 3.5
percent, and fourth quarter growth was approximately 2.0 percent (annualized rates). consumer
48
spending was again the key driver of overall economic growth in 2016. according to preliminary data, private domestic demand grew at a rate of 2.3 percent in 2016, after adjusting for inflation.
business investment spending was a persistent drag on top-line growth in 2016, as was also the case in 2015. one key difference, however, is that while in 2015 weakness in business investment spending was mainly a function of sharp cutbacks in energy-related investments, the weakness was more broad-based in 2016. in an environment of persistently slow top-line growth and an already considerable degree of idle industrial capacity, companies had little incentive to undertake capital investment in 2016. weak business investment spending in turn contributed to generally weak conditions in manufacturing in 2016, with the exception of automotive and automotive parts manufacturers. additionally, domestic manufacturing was also impacted by a soft global growth environment that resulted in u.s. exports of goods being basically unchanged from 2015.
in contrast, another year of steadily improving labor market conditions led to solid growth in inflation adjusted personal income that, in turn, supported growth in consumer spending. in addition to improved labor market conditions, u.s. consumers also benefitted from low interest rates, low inflation, and rising household net worth.
consumers responded by not only increasing discretionary spending, but also by building up savings and paying down debt. household balance sheets ended 2016 in better condition than has been the case for several years.
over the course of 2016 there was considerable volatility in financial markets, both in the u.s. and abroad. early in 2016, fears that growth in the chinese economy would slow sharply and perhaps touch off broad based deflation led to a decline in long-term u.s. interest rates. in the aftermath of the brexit vote in late june, long-term u.s.
interest rates fell even more sharply, with yields on 10-year u.s. treasury notes falling below 1.4 percent.
following the november elections, however, long-term interest rates jumped dramatically and closed the year at just under 2.5 percent with short-term rates rising by a lesser extent. expectations that both growth and inflation would be faster than has been the case in recent years pushed market interest rates and the exchange value of the u.s. dollar sharply higher.
the fomc raised the mid-point of the fed funds rate target range by 25 basis points in december, making 2016 the second consecutive year in which the fomc raised the target range mid-point only once. given the uncertainty around the path of the u.s. economy, a soft global growth environment, and inflation remaining below their 2.0 percent target rate, the fomc had the latitude to remain patient on removing monetary accommodation. currently, however, the fomc has less latitude to remain patient and the "dot plot" released in conjunction with their december 2016
meeting implied three 25-basis point hikes in the fed funds rate target range mid-point in 2017, one more than had been implied in the prior edition of the dot plot released in conjunction with the september 2016 fomc meeting.
differentials in rates of economic growth and central bank policy paths could be a source of persistent upward pressure on the exchange value of the u.s. dollar in 2017. further dollar appreciation would act as a drag on growth in u.s. exports and on u.s. corporate profits, and would put further downward pressure on prices of imported goods, thereby making it harder for the fomc to hit their inflation target. these differentials could also be a source of persistent volatility in global financial markets in 2017 that could result in sharp swings in asset prices, market interest rates, and exchange rates around a fairly stable mean. as such, while regions looks for moderate increases in long-term u.s. interest rates in 2017, a considerable degree of volatility and sharp swings, in either direction, that ultimately will not be sustained is expected.
the fomc is currently trying to assess what significant changes to fiscal, regulatory, and trade policy will alter the course of the u.s. economy, and to a lesser extent the global economy, in 2017. with no specific policy proposals yet on the table, it is not possible to quantify the effects on economic growth and regions' baseline forecast for 2017 continues to call for real gdp growth of 2.1 percent. consumer spending and housing, single family housing in particular, are expected to be the primary drivers for growth in 2017. based on the likely contours of changes to policy in 2017, however, potential upside risks to a baseline outlook from fiscal and regulatory policy and potential downside risks from trade policy exist. business investment spending and government spending are two areas that may have the most upside potential, while exports, and by extension manufacturing, may have the most downside potential. it should be noted that the outlook for housing would be less favorable should we see continued increases in mortgage interest rates occur following the increases already seen after the november elections. on the whole, regions believes the potential upside risks to growth outweigh the potential downside risks to growth.
that said, regions thinks many analysts are discounting the likelihood that the policy changes that ultimately emerge from the legislative process will be less impactful than what was discussed during the course of the presidential campaign, and also believes the legislative process may take longer than many analysts seem to be expecting. as such, regions does not expect meaningful impacts on economic growth until the fourth quarter of 2017, meaning growth for the year is not likely to stray far from its baseline forecast. regions does, however, see more upside potential for growth in 2018.
within the regions footprint, rates of job, income, and overall economic growth have been and are expected to remain broadly consistent with those seen nationally. there are, however, differences in rates of growth among the individual states and metropolitan areas across the footprint. markets with exposure to energy and trade underperformed in 2016, as was the case in 2015, though by year-end some firming in crude oil prices brought some relief to those markets with heavy energy exposure. should the u.s. economy and the global economy evolve as expected in 2017, energy prices should remain fairly stable. however, should trade policy evolve along the lines discussed during the presidential campaign, those markets with heavy exposure to trade could suffer
49
from lower export and import volumes, and in turn diminished shipping volumes would take a toll on domestic transportation operations. those markets which are larger and more economically diverse and boast demographic trends have been and are expected to remain among the better performing markets within regions' footprint. housing market activity appears to be picking up at a steady pace within regions' footprint. as is the case for the u.s. as a whole, multi-family construction has rebounded far more rapidly than has single family construction. over the course of 2017, it is expected single family construction will take on a larger role while multi-family construction will begin to recede from cyclical peaks as there is a considerable degree of supply in the pipeline.
further increases in mortgage interest rates could alter both the outlook for overall residential construction and the mix between single family and multi-family construction. as has been the case nationally, house price appreciation in regions' larger metro area markets picked up notably over the course of 2016, but a slower pace of price appreciation in 2017 is expected.
in summation, real gdp growth is expected to be in the 2.0 percent to 2.5 percent range for 2017 and 2018 but at present upside risks to a baseline outlook depending on the evolution of economic and regulatory policy exist in the coming months. the global growth outlook remains uneven and uncertain and this could be a source of volatility in global financial markets in 2017 even if there is limited economic impact in the u.s. the fomc will face a new set of challenges in 2017, given the potential shifts in fiscal, regulatory, and trade policy, and as such greater scope for not only more aggressive action on the part of the fomc than has been the case in recent years, but also for policy decisions that could add to volatility in global financial markets may be seen.
counterparty risk counterparty risk within regions bank is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction or contract could be unable or unwilling to fulfill its contractual or legal obligations. exposure may be to a financial institution
(such as commercial banks, insurance companies, broker dealers, etc.) or a corporate client.
regions has a centralized approach to approval, management, and monitoring of counterparty exposure. counterparty risk management, housed within capital markets risk management, is responsible for the independent credit risk management of financial institution counterparties and their affiliates. market risk management is responsible for the suitability, measurement, and stress testing of counterparty exposures. business services credit is responsible for the independent credit risk management of client side counterparties.
financial institution exposure may result from a variety of transaction types generated in one or more departments of the company. exposure limits are established to manage the exposure generated by various areas of the company.
counterparty client credit risk arises when regions sells a risk management product to hedge risks in the client's business. exposures to counterparties are aggregated across departments and regularly reported to senior management.
information security risk regions faces a variety of operational risks, including information security risks. information security risks such as evolving and adaptive cyber-attacks, regularly conducted against regions and other large financial institutions to compromise or disable information systems, have generally increased in recent years. this trend is expected to continue for a number of reasons, including the proliferation of new technologies, the use of mobile devices, more financial transactions conducted online, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees.
regions spends significant resources to identify and mitigate threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its information systems. regions regularly assesses the threats and vulnerabilities to its environment so it can update and maintain its systems and controls to effectively mitigate these risks. layered security controls are designed to complement each other to protect customer information and transactions. regions will continue to commit the resources necessary to mitigate these growing cyber risks, as well as continue to develop and enhance controls, processes and technology to protect its systems from attacks or unauthorized access. in addition, regions maintains a strong commitment to a comprehensive risk management program that includes oversight of third-party relationships involving vendors. the board, through its various committees, is briefed at least quarterly on information security matters.
regions participates in information sharing organizations such as fs-isac, to gather and share information amongst peer banks and other financial institutions to better prepare and protect its information systems from attack. fs-
isac is a nonprofit organization whose objective is to protect the financial services sector against cyber and physical threats and risk. it acts as a trusted third party that provides anonymity to allow members to submit threat, vulnerability and incident information in a non-attributable and trusted manner so information that would normally not be shared is instead made available for the greater good of the membership. in addition to fs-isac, regions is a member of bits, the technology arm of the financial services roundtable. bits serves the financial community and its members by providing industry best practices on a variety of security and fraud topics.
regions has contracts with vendors to provide denial of service mitigation. these vendors have also continued to commit the necessary resources to support regions in the event of an attack. even though regions devotes significant resources to combat cyber security risks, there is no guarantee that these measures will provide absolute security. as an additional security measure, regions has placed a computer forensics firm and an industry-
leading consulting firm on retainer in case of a breach event.
50
even if regions successfully prevents data breaches to its own networks, the company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information obtained through breaches of retailers' networks where customers have transacted business. the fraud losses, as well as the costs of investigations and re-issuing new customer cards impact regions' financial results. in addition, regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain components of its business infrastructure, which may also increase information security risk.
regulatory risk in 2014, the federal reserve bank of atlanta began a regularly scheduled cra examination of regions bank covering
2012 and 2013 performance. this review included, among other things, a review of regions bank's previously disclosed public consent orders. as a result of the examination, the results of which were communicated during the fourth quarter of 2015, regions bank received "high satisfactory" ratings on its cra components, but its overall cra rating was downgraded from "satisfactory" to "needs to improve." the downgrade was attributed to the matters underlying regions bank's april 2015 public consent order with the cfpb related to overdrafts and regulation e.
regions bank had self-reported these matters and provided remuneration to affected customers during 2011 and 2012.
this downgrade imposed restrictions on the company's ability to undertake certain activities, including mergers and acquisitions of insured depository institutions and applications to open branches or certain other facilities until such time as the rating was improved. on december 19, 2016, the federal reserve bank of atlanta informed regions that the company's overall cra rating had been reinstated from "needs to improve" to "satisfactory" and this regulatory issue is resolved. further, regions continued to receive a "high satisfactory" rating on the lending, investment and service portions of the company's most recent cra review.
financial disclosure and internal controls regions has always maintained internal controls over financial reporting, which generally include those controls relating to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap. regions' process for evaluating internal controls over financial reporting starts with understanding the risks facing each of its functions and areas, how those risks are controlled or mitigated, and how management monitors those controls to ensure that they are in place and effective. these risks, control procedures and monitoring tools are documented in a standard format. this format not only documents the internal control structures over all significant accounts, but also places responsibility on management for establishing feedback mechanisms to ensure that controls are effective.
regions has also established processes to ensure appropriate disclosure controls and procedures are maintained.
these controls and procedures as defined by the sec are generally designed to ensure that financial and non-
financial information required to be disclosed in reports filed with the sec is reported within the time periods specified in the sec's rules and forms, and that such information is communicated to management, including the ceo and cfo, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
regions' disclosure review committee, which includes representatives from the legal, risk management, accounting, investor relations, and treasury departments, meets quarterly to review recent internal and external events to determine whether all appropriate disclosures have been made in reports filed with the sec. in addition, the ceo and cfo meet quarterly with the sec filings review committee, which includes senior representatives from accounting, legal, risk management, treasury, and the business groups. the sec filings review committee provides a forum in which senior executives disclose to the ceo and cfo any known significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in regions' internal controls over financial reporting, and provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements and other contents of the company's form 10-k and 10-q filings are accurate, complete and timely. as part of this process, certifications of internal control effectiveness are obtained from regions'
associates who are responsible for maintaining and monitoring effective internal controls over financial reporting.
these certifications are reviewed and presented to the ceo and cfo as support of the company's assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. the form 10-k is presented to the audit committee of the board of directors for approval, and the forms 10-q are reviewed by the audit committee. financial results and other financial information are also reviewed with the audit committee on a quarterly basis.
as required by sections 302 and 906 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the ceo and the cfo review and make certifications regarding the accuracy of regions' periodic public reports filed with the sec, as well as the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. with the assistance of the financial review committees noted in the previous paragraph, regions will continue to assess and monitor disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, and will make refinements as necessary.
comparison of
2015
with
2014
-continuing operations regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.1 billion, or $0.76 per diluted common share, in
2015 compared to $0.79 per diluted share in 2014. regions reported income from continuing operations available to common shareholders of $1.0 billion, or $0.76 per diluted common share, in 2015 compared to $1.1 billion, or $0.78
per diluted share, in 2014.
51
net interest income and other financing income from continuing operations was $3.3 billion in both 2015 and 2014.
the net interest margin from continuing operations (taxable-equivalent basis) was 3.13 percent in 2015 , compared to 3.21 percent during 2014. the margin decline was driven primarily by decreases in yields on earning assets exceeding the decline in funding costs.
non-interest income from continuing operations increased $168 million to $2.1 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. the year-over-year increase was due to an increase in insurance proceeds, capital markets fee income and other and card and atm fees. see table 5 "non-interest income from continuing operations" for additional information.
in 2015 , insurance proceeds increased $91 million compared to 2014. the increase was primarily driven by the settlement of the previously disclosed and accrued 2010 class action lawsuit.
capital markets fee income and other increased $31 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase was primarily related to increased securities underwriting and placement fees and loan syndication fees. mergers and acquisitions advisory fees, which were derived from the purchase of blackarch partners, also contributed to the increase.
card and atm fees increased $30 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase was a result of increased checking accounts, as well as increased transactions in part by the continued migration of transactions from cash and checks to cards. additionally, the increase in active credit cards generated greater purchase activity resulting in higher interchange income.
non-interest expense from continuing operations increased $175 million in 2015 compared to 2014. increases in non-
interest expense in 2015 included increases in branch consolidation, property and equipment charges and fdic insurance assessments, as well as losses on early extinguishment of debt. these increases were offset by decreases in professional, legal and regulatory expenses, net occupancy expense, salaries and employee benefits and a 2014
gain on the sale of tdrs held for sale that did not repeat. see table 6 "non-interest expense from continuing operations" for additional information.
branch consolidation, property and equipment charges increased $40 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. the increase was due to additional charges related to the transfer of land previously held for branch expansion, to held for sale based on changes in management's intent, as management identified certain parcels of land that were no longer intended to be developed. this increase also included write-offs and depreciation for closed branches.
fdic insurance assessments increased $30 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. the increase is primarily due to a
$23 million adjustment to prior assessments recorded during the third quarter of 2015 that exceeded the benefit of refunds of previously incurred fees recognized in prior quarters.
during 2015, the company incurred $43 million in early extinguishment charges, related to the redemption of certain subordinated debt.
professional, legal, and regulatory expenses decreased $98 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. the company recorded $50 million and $100 million of contingent legal expenses in 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to previously disclosed matters. the 2014 accruals were settled in 2015 for $2 million less than originally estimated, and a corresponding recovery was recorded. excluding these items, professional, legal, and regulatory expenses decreased $46 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower consulting fees and lower legal fees resulting from a declining case load as well as legal fee recoveries.
net occupancy expense decreased 2 percent to $361 million in 2015 as compared to 2014.
total salaries and employee benefits increased $73 million, or 4 percent, in 2015. the increase is primarily due to increases in base salaries, as well as expenses from liabilities held for employee benefit purposes. higher pension, health insurance, severance expenses and higher incentives. headcount increased from 23,723 at december
31, 2014 to 23,916 at december 31, 2015.
during the fourth quarter of 2013, regions transferred certain residential first mortgage loans classified as tdrs to loans held for sale. these loans were sold during the first quarter of 2014, resulting in a $35 million net gain.
outside services increased $18 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in certain fees paid in connection with revenue growth as well as increased servicing costs related to continued purchases of indirect loans from third parties.
the company's income tax expense for 2015 was $455 million compared to $548 million in 2014, resulting in an effective tax rate of 29.7 percent and 32.6 percent, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate was driven primarily by audit settlements reached with the irs and certain state taxing authorities, tax benefits related to state deferred taxes and lower pre-tax income.
at december 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses totaled $1.1 billion or 1.36 percent of total loans, net of unearned income compared to $1.1 billion or 1.43 percent at december 31, 2014. net charge-offs totaled $238
million, or 0.30 percent of average loans in 2015 compared to $307 million, or 0.40 percent of average loans in
2014. net charge-offs were lower across most major categories when comparing 2015 to 2014 primarily due to fundamental improvement in credit performance. during 2015, the provision for loan losses was $241 million as compared to $69 million in 2014. non-performing assets decreased from $991
52
million at december 31, 2014, to $920 million at december 31, 2015, which reflected management's continuing efforts to work through problem assets and reduce the riskiest exposures.

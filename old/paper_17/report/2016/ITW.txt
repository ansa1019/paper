item 1a. risk factors the company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
the company's results are impacted by global economic conditions. downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect its businesses, results of operations or financial condition.
the company's businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe, including the uncertainty created by the united kingdom's june 2016 vote to leave the european union. slower economic growth, financial market instability, high unemployment, government deficit reduction, sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets the company serves can adversely affect the company's businesses by reducing demand for the company's products and services, limiting financing available to the company's customers, increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts

receivable, increasing price competition, or increasing the risk that counterparties to the company's contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations.
the global nature of the company's operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.
the company currently operates in 57 countries. the risks inherent in the company's global operations include:
•   fluctuation in currency exchange rates;
•   limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises;
•   price controls, exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings;
•   transportation delays and interruptions;
•   political, social and economic instability and disruptions;
•   acts of terrorism;
•   government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions;
•   the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;
•   import and export controls;
•   labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;
•   the potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises;
•   difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;
•   limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and
•   potentially adverse tax consequences.
the united kingdom's vote in june 2016 to leave the european union may increase certain of the risks and uncertainties described above. the united kingdom represented approximately 5% of the company's total consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december 31, 2016. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition.
the benefits from the company's enterprise strategy may not be as expected and the company's financial results could be adversely impacted.
as the company has substantially completed its enterprise strategy initiatives of portfolio management and business structure simplification, its focus has pivoted to organic revenue growth and continued margin improvement. product line and customer base simplification activities, which are core elements of the company's 80/20 management process, continue to be applied to the company's scaled up operating divisions and remain active elements of the enterprise strategy. although these activities are expected to improve future operating margins and organic revenue growth, they are also expected to have a negative impact on the company's overall organic revenue growth in the short term. if the company is unable to realize the expected benefits from its enterprise strategy initiatives, the company's financial results could be adversely impacted.
the timing and amount of the company's share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.
share repurchases constitute a significant component of the company's capital allocation strategy. the company funds its share repurchases with free cash flow and short-term borrowings. the amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors. important factors that could cause the company to limit, suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions, the price of the company's common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time, the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of u.s. cash.
the company may incur fines or penalties, damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery, competition, export and import, environmental or other laws.
the company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decision-making autonomy within the company's strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls. the company cannot ensure that its internal controls will always protect against reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees, agents or business partners that might violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including anti-bribery, competition, export and import, and environmental laws. any such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal investigations, could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against the company or its subsidiaries, or could damage its reputation.
11
a significant fluctuation between the u.s. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the company's operating income.
although the company's financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe. the company's profitability is affected by movements of the u.s. dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses. significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, and in particular, an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies, has had and could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition.
if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property, its future growth may be adversely affected.
the company's ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources. difficulties or delays in research, development, production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company's competitive position. if the company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation, its organic growth may be adversely affected.
protecting the company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and/or other intellectual property rights related to many of its products, and also has exclusive and non-exclusive license rights under intellectual property owned by others. the company's intellectual property rights may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. unauthorized use of the company's intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company's competitive position and results of operations.
the company's acquisition of businesses could negatively impact its profitability and returns.
acquisitions, including the company's acquisition of the engineered fasteners and components business on july 1, 2016 from zf trw, involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect the company's profitability and returns:
•   the acquired business could under-perform relative to the company's expectations and the price paid for it, or not perform in accordance with the company's anticipated timetable.
•   the acquired business could cause the company's financial results to differ from expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term.
•   acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results.
•   the acquired business could place unanticipated demands on the company's management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems.
•   the company may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired business's activities. the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase the company's expenses, adversely affect its financial position or cause noncompliance with its financial reporting obligations.
•   as a result of acquisitions, the company has in the past recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet. if the company is not able to realize the value of these assets, it may recognize charges relating to the impairment of these assets.
recent divestitures pose the risk of retained liabilities that could adversely affect the company's financial results.
the company's divestiture activity increased in 2012, 2013 and 2014 in accordance with its portfolio management initiative. though the divestiture element of its portfolio management initiative is essentially complete, the company has retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyer against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters.
12
the company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets, and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
the company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. a number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets, including significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets. impairment charges could result that adversely affect the company's financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized.
disruptions or volatility in global financial markets or changes in our credit ratings could increase our funding costs or reduce the availability of credit.
global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the financial markets. the company's continued ability to meet its cash requirements requires substantial liquidity and access to the financial markets. in addition, the company's borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. if conditions in the financial markets decline or the company's credit ratings are negatively impacted, its funding costs could be increased or the availability of credit could be diminished.
raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results.
the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company's results of operations and profit margins. due to pricing pressure or other factors, the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results.
the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and in various foreign jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. the company's effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. the amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments.
the company's defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows.
the performance of financial markets and interest rates impact the company's funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.
potential adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect results.
the company's businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors. the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self-insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. in addition, the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. even if it maintains adequate insurance programs, claims could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future.
13
if the company is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage.
the company relies on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection. these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; attacks by computer hackers; computer viruses; employee error or malfeasance. in addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. if these information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction illinois tool works inc. (the "company" or "itw") is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with 85 divisions in 57 countries. as of december 31, 2016, the company employed approximately 50,000 persons.
the company's operations are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and end markets, and are reported to senior management as the following seven segments: automotive oem; food equipment; test & measurement and electronics; welding; polymers & fluids; construction products; and specialty products.
due to the large number of diverse businesses and the company's decentralized operating structure, the company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. instead, the company's corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. these key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management.
the itw business model the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model is the company's core source of value creation. this business model is the company's competitive advantage and defines how itw creates value for its shareholders and comprises three unique elements:
•   itw's 80/20 management process is the operating system that is applied in every itw business. initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980's, itw has continually refined, improved and expanded 80/20 into a proprietary, holistic business management process that generates significant value for the company and its customers. through the application of data-driven insights generated by 80/20 practice, itw focuses on its largest and best opportunities (the "80") and eliminates cost, complexity and distractions associated with the less profitable opportunities (the "20"). 80/20 enables itw businesses to consistently achieve world-class operational excellence in product availability, quality, and innovation, while generating superior financial performance;
•   customer-back innovation has fueled decades of profitable growth at itw. the company's unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 80/20 management process. working from the customer back, itw businesses position themselves as the go-to problem solver for their "80" customers. itw's innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs, particularly those in "80" markets with solid long-term growth fundamentals, and subsequently creating unique solutions to address those needs. these customer insights and learnings drive innovation at itw and have contributed to a portfolio of more than 17,000 granted and pending patents;
•   itw's decentralized, entrepreneurial culture allows itw businesses to be fast, focused, and responsive. itw businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the itw business model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers' needs. itw colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the company's strategy and values. as a result, the company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that, combined with outstanding execution, delivers best-in-class services adapted to each business' customers and end markets.
enterprise strategy in late 2012, itw began the process of transitioning the company onto its current strategic path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the itw business model. since then, itw has made considerable progress, as evidenced by the company's strong financial performance over the past four years.
the roots of itw's enterprise strategy began in late 2011 / early 2012, when the company undertook a complete review of its performance. focusing on its businesses delivering consistent above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns, itw developed a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations.
19
based on this rigorous evaluation, itw determined that solid and consistent above-market organic growth must be the core growth engine to deliver world-class financial performance and compelling long-term returns for its shareholders. to shift its primary growth engine to organic, the company began executing a multi-step approach.
•   the first step was to narrow the focus and improve the quality of itw's business portfolio. as part of the portfolio management initiative, itw exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a must-have requirement for all itw businesses. this process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated itw divisions.
as a result of this work, itw's business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential. itw segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate price/cost increases. the company achieved this through product line simplification, or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, while supporting and growing the businesses' largest / most profitable customers and product lines. with the initiative nearly complete and itw businesses demonstrating notably improved financial performance, the company believes that the significant product line simplification work is essentially finalized and will return to more normalized levels in 2017 and beyond.
•   step two, business structure simplification, was implemented to simplify and scale-up itw's operating structure to support increased engineering, marketing, and sales resources, and, at the same time, improve global reach and competitiveness, all of which were critical to driving accelerated organic growth. itw now has 85 scaled-up divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments, core customers and products, and customer-back innovation.
•   the strategic sourcing initiative was established as a core capability to better leverage itw's scale and improve global competitiveness. sourcing is now a core strategic and operational capability at itw. the company's 80/20-enabled sourcing organization has delivered an average of one percent reduction in spend each year from 2013 through 2016 and is on track to do the same in 2017 and 2018.
•   with the portfolio realignment and scale-up work largely complete, the company was able to shift its focus to preparing for and accelerating, organic growth. as a preparatory step, itw is in the process of reapplying 80/20 to optimize its newly scaled-up divisions for growth, first, to build a foundation of operational excellence, and second, to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth.
once the business has achieved operational excellence and identified the right growth opportunities, the final step is to accelerate organic growth. the process of preparing for accelerated organic growth generally takes 18 to 24 months.
based on the financial performance of the divisions that are further along in this process, the company believes that its organic growth framework is capable of delivering above-market organic growth across all segments. divisions are at various phases in preparation for growth and many are either ready to grow or already growing above their respective markets. itw management is fully aligned with this plan and very focused on executing it. with the close of 2016, approximately 85 percent of the divisions are ready to grow.
path to full potential while the company has made considerable progress and itw's performance is nearing best-in-class levels, the company has significant opportunity for further improvement before it achieves full operating potential. in order to do so, itw is focused on two key areas of opportunity, including: additional structural margin improvement and sustained above-market organic growth with strong incremental profitability.
additional structural margin improvement to deliver on the additional structural margin improvement, the company is implementing the following two levers: (1) further leveraging the 80/20 management process and (2) strategic sourcing.
•   the first lever, better leveraging the full power of the itw business model, will be accomplished through a much more consistent and focused approach to 80/20 best practice implementation across the company. the 80/20
20
management system has continuously been refined, improved and expanded into a unique holistic business management process of interconnected tools, which improves all aspects of the business and, when applied consistently and executed more effectively, will lead to additional margin improvement. itw has clearly demonstrated superior 80/20 management, resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the company's operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. these 80/20 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns.
•   the second lever, strategic sourcing, is a core element of itw's ongoing operational strategy and a sustainable enterprise-wide capability. through the continued execution of this initiative, the company expects to deliver additional margin improvement with the goal of a one percent reduction in spend in 2017 and 2018.
sustained above-market organic growth with strong incremental profitability itw has done extensive work on its portfolio and operating structure to position the company to deliver sustainable above-market organic growth. the company has narrowed the focus and significantly improved the growth potential of itw's business portfolio. with approximately 85% of its divisions ready to grow as of the end of 2016, itw is well positioned for accelerated growth in 2017 and beyond. to deliver on this accelerated growth, the divisions have been implementing the organic growth framework, which includes continued investment in customer-back innovation and a strengthened focus on market penetration. itw continues to focus on growing its share of "80" products with existing customers with whom the company has a resonant value proposition as well as target potential new customers with similar pain points to existing customers. itw has made strong progress on the company's pivot to organic growth and is well positioned to deliver on sustained above-market organic growth over the long-term.
terms used by itw management uses the following terms to describe the financial results of operations of the company:
•   organic business - acquired businesses that have been included in the company's results of operations for more than 12 months on a constant currency basis.
•   operating leverage - the estimated effect of the organic revenue volume changes on organic operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period.
•   price/cost - represents the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the company's products versus changes in the selling price to the company's customers.
•   product line simplification (pls) - focuses businesses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines; in the short-term, pls may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. in the long-term, pls is expected to result in growth in revenue, profitability, and returns.
unless otherwise stated, the changes in financial results in the consolidated results of operations and the results of operations by segment represent the current year period versus the comparable period in the prior year.
consolidated results of operations leveraging itw's highly differentiated and proprietary business model, the company delivered strong financial results in 2016 despite a challenging global macro environment and foreign currency translation headwinds. with the solid execution of the company's enterprise strategy initiatives, six of seven segments achieved worldwide organic revenue growth and five of seven segments had operating margin expansion.
on july 1, 2016, the company completed the acquisition of the engineered fasteners and components business ("ef&c") from zf trw for a purchase price of approximately $450 million. ef&c had operating revenue of $245 million for the six months ended december 31, 2016. ef&c diluted the company's operating margin in 2016 by 30 basis points due to lower operating margin and acquisition related expenses. the company expects ef&c to be slightly accretive to earnings in the first twelve months, but expects improved earnings and operating margin performance in later years through the application of the company's 80/20 business management process. the operating results of ef&c are reported within the company's automotive oem segment. the acquisition of ef&c did not materially affect the company's results of operations or financial position for any period presented. refer to note 3. acquisitions in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.

•   operating revenue increased due to growth in organic and acquisition revenues, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.
•   organic revenue grew 1.2% as six of seven segments had worldwide organic revenue growth primarily due to penetration gains, higher end market demand and product innovation. organic revenue declined in the welding segment primarily due to lower capital spending in the industrial end markets and sluggish demand in the oil and gas end market.
◦   pls activities associated with the portfolio management component of the company's enterprise strategy reduced organic revenue growth by approximately one percentage point.
◦   north american organic revenue increased 0.7% and european organic revenue increased 2.3% as growth in six segments for both regions was partially offset by a decline in the welding segment.
◦   asia pacific organic revenue increased 2.7% primarily due to growth in the automotive oem, specialty products, construction products, food equipment, and test &amp; measurement and electronics segments, partially offset by a decline in the welding and polymers &amp; fluids segments.
•   operating margin of 22.5% increased 110 basis points. the primary driver of the operating margin improvement was 130 basis points from the benefit of the company's enterprise initiatives. positive operating leverage of 30 basis points and favorable price/cost of 10 basis points were partially offset by the dilutive impact of 30 basis points from the ef&amp;c acquisition and additional investment in the business.
•   in 2016, the company received a $167 million cash dividend distribution from wilsonart which exceeded the company's equity investment balance and resulted in a $54 million pre-tax gain, partially offset by $30 million of pre-tax losses related to the disposals of businesses and the disposal of a partnership investment. refer to note 4. other income (expense) in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information on the wilsonart equity investment.
•   diluted earnings per share (eps) of $5.70 increased 11.1%.
•   free cash flow was $2.0 billion in 2016. refer to the cash flow section of liquidity and capital resources for a reconciliation of this non-gaap measure.
•   the company repurchased approximately 18.7 million shares of its common stock in 2016 for approximately $2.0 billion.
•   total cash dividends of $821 million were paid in 2016.
•   adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital was 22.1%, an increase of 170 basis points. refer to the adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital section of liquidity and capital resources for a reconciliation of this non-gaap measure.

•   organic revenue increased 1.2% primarily driven by growth in the consumer packaging, ground support equipment and sports branding businesses.
◦   international organic revenue increased 2.3% driven by growth in the appliance, foils, and gluing system businesses in asia pacific.
◦   north american organic revenue increased 0.6% driven by growth in the consumer packaging and medical businesses, partially offset by a decline in the brand identification businesses.
•   operating margin of 25.6% increased 230 basis points primarily driven by the net benefits of the company's enterprise initiatives and cost management of 220 basis points and positive operating leverage of 30 basis points, partially offset by unfavorable price/cost of 20 basis points.

•   operating revenue decreased due to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation and the decrease in organic revenue.
•   organic revenue declined 2.3%.
◦   growth in the consumer packaging businesses, driven by strong food and beverage end market demand, and in the brand identification businesses, due to increased medical, credit card, and automotive end market demand, was more than offset by the impact of a challenging capital spending environment and ongoing pls activities.
◦   north american organic revenue decreased 3.2% as growth in the consumer packaging and brand identification businesses was more than offset by a decline in the ground support equipment and the appliance businesses. international organic revenue decreased 0.9% primarily due to a decline in the ground support equipment businesses, partially offset by growth in the consumer packaging businesses.
•   operating income of $439 million decreased 0.4%. excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 6.4%, operating income would have increased 6.0%.
•   operating margin improved 190 basis points to 23.3% primarily due to the net benefits of the company's enterprise initiatives and cost management of 150 basis points, favorable price/cost of 50 basis points and lower restructuring expenses, partially offset by negative operating leverage of 50 basis points.
other financial highlights
•   interest expense was $237 million in 2016, an increase from $226 million in 2015, primarily due to debt issuances in 2016. interest expense was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 ($250 million in 2014) due to debt issuances in 2014 and 2015 at lower rates compared to prior debt obligations.
•   other income (expense) was income of $81 million in 2016, $78 million in 2015 and $61 million in 2014. the income in 2016 included a $54 million pre-tax gain resulting from a $167 million dividend distribution from wilsonart that exceeded the equity investment balance, partially offset by $30 million of pre-tax losses in 2016 related to the disposals of businesses and the disposal of a partnership investment. the increase in income in 2015 versus 2014 was primarily due to a $15 million gain on the sale of a business in the first quarter of 2015.
•   the effective tax rate was 30.0% in 2016, 30.1% in 2015, and 30.0% in 2014.
•   the impact of the euro and other foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar decreased operating revenue by approximately $210 million in 2016 versus 2015 and $995 million in 2015 versus 2014. additionally, the impact of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar decreased income from continuing operations by approximately $41 million in 2016 versus 2015 and $153 million in 2015 versus 2014.
discontinued operations in february 2013, the company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for the industrial packaging segment. in september 2013, the company's board of directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the industrial packaging segment. the company classified the industrial packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and no longer presented this segment as part of its continuing operations.
on february 6, 2014, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the industrial packaging business to the carlyle group for $3.2 billion. the transaction was completed on may 1, 2014, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax) in the second quarter of 2014 which was included in income from discontinued operations.
the operating results of the former industrial packaging segment as well as two construction products businesses are reported as discontinued operations in the statement of income for 2014. as of the second quarter of 2014, the company had completed the divestiture of all of the businesses previously classified as discontinued operations. refer to note 2.

new accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (the "fasb") issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for revenue recognition. the core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. in addition, several new revenue recognition disclosures will be required. this guidance is effective for the company beginning january 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. the company expects to adopt the new revenue accounting guidance effective january 1, 2018 and is in the process of completing its analysis of the impact this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
in february 2016, the fasb issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for recognizing leasing transactions. under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize a lease liability and lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a lease term greater than twelve months in the statement of financial position. subsequent measurement, including presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification of the lease as either a financing or operating lease. in addition, several new disclosures will be required. this guidance is effective for the company beginning january 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. while the company has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact the new lease accounting guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, the company expects to recognize right of use assets and liabilities for its operating leases in the statement of financial position upon adoption.
in march 2016, the fasb issued authoritative guidance that includes several changes to simplify the accounting for stock-based compensation, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements and classification of tax benefits in the statement of cash flows. among the more significant changes, the new guidance requires that the income tax effects associated with the settlement of stock-based awards after adoption of the guidance be recognized through income tax expense rather than directly in equity. additionally, the income tax effects related to excess tax benefits will be presented as an operating cash flow in the statement of cash flows rather than a financing activity for all current and prior periods presented. the company adopted this guidance effective january 1, 2017. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, the company had classified $29 million and $20 million, respectively, of excess tax benefits as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows which will be presented as an operating cash flow under the new guidance. the expected effect on income tax expense or net cash provided from operating activities related to stock-based awards settled after adoption of the new guidance will depend on inputs such as the stock price at the time of settlement and the number of awards settled in the period presented.
in october 2016, the fasb issued authoritative guidance requiring the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs rather than when transferred to a third party as required under the current guidance. the new guidance is effective for the company beginning january 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. the company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption.
in january 2017, the fasb issued authoritative guidance that simplifies the assessment of goodwill for impairment when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value by eliminating the requirement to determine the fair value of goodwill. under the new guidance, the amount of goodwill impairment will be determined by the amount the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. the new guidance is effective for the company beginning january 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. the company performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment process in the third quarter, or more frequently if triggering events occur. adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company's operating results, financial position or cash flows.
liquidity and capital resources the company's primary sources of liquidity are free cash flow and short-term credit facilities. in addition, the company had $2.5 billion of cash on hand at december 31, 2016 and also maintains strong access to public debt markets. management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the company's capital allocation priorities, which include:
•   internal investments to support organic growth and sustain core businesses;
•   payment of an attractive dividend to shareholders; and
33
•   external investments in selective strategic acquisitions that support the company's organic growth focus and an active share repurchase program.
in september 2013, the company's board of directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the industrial packaging business. the company classified the industrial packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and no longer presented this segment as part of its continuing operations. as to the impact of this divestiture on the company's income per share from continuing operations and capital structure going forward, the company also indicated that it intended to repurchase approximately 50 million shares through a program utilizing its existing share repurchase authorization to offset the full amount of divestiture-related dilution of income per share from continuing operations through a combination of sale proceeds, free cash flow and additional leverage. the company completed this program in the second quarter of 2014. under this program, the company repurchased approximately 14.0 million shares of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2013 and approximately 35.7 million shares of its common stock in the first half of 2014.
on february 6, 2014, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the industrial packaging business to the carlyle group for $3.2 billion. the transaction was completed on may 1, 2014, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax) in the second quarter of 2014 which was included in income from discontinued operations. a portion of the proceeds was used to fund share repurchases under the program noted above.
the company believes that, based on its operating revenue, operating margin, free cash flow, and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary.
cash flow the company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. the company believes this non-gaap financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the company's financial performance and measures the company's ability to generate cash internally to fund company initiatives. free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. summarized cash flow information for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was as follows:

adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital the company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("roic") to measure the effectiveness of its operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. roic is a non-gaap financial measure that the company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company's financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate roic. adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the company's operations, as well as the company's net investment in the former industrial packaging segment and the equity investment in the wilsonart business (formerly the decorative surfaces segment). average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. roic for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was as follows:

the decrease in net working capital at december 31, 2016 was primarily driven by lower cash and equivalents.
cash and equivalents totaled approximately $2.5 billion as of december 31, 2016 and $3.1 billion as of december 31, 2015, primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries. cash and equivalents held internationally may be subject to u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the u.s. cash and equivalents balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, used to fund new international acquisitions, or used to repay debt held internationally. in the u.s., the company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs, which primarily consist of dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. the company also uses its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities, for short-term liquidity needs. the company believes cash generated domestically and liquidity provided by the company's commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the u.s.
debt total debt at december 31, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:

in 2016, the company reclassified $650 million related to the 0.90% notes due february 25, 2017 from long-term debt to short-term debt. there was no commercial paper outstanding as of december 31, 2016. as of december 31, 2015, short-term debt included commercial paper of $498 million.
the company may issue commercial paper to fund general corporate needs, share repurchases, and small and medium-sized acquisitions. during the second quarter of 2016, the company entered into a $2.5 billion, five-year line of credit agreement with a termination date of may 9, 2021 to support the potential issuances of commercial paper. this agreement replaced the previously existing $1.5 billion line of credit agreement with a termination date of june 8, 2017 and the $1.0 billion line of credit agreement with a termination date of august 15, 2018. no amounts were outstanding under the new line of credit agreement at december 31, 2016. the maximum outstanding commercial paper balance during 2016 was $1.3 billion, while
36
the average daily balance was $266 million. as of december 31, 2016, the company's foreign operations had authorized credit facilities with unused capacity of $286 million.
in may 2015, the company issued €500 million of 1.25% euro notes due may 22, 2023 at 99.239% of face value and €500 million of 2.125% euro notes due may 22, 2030 at 99.303% of face value. net proceeds from the may 2015 debt issuances were used to repay commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.
in november 2016, the company issued $1.0 billion of 2.65% notes due november 15, 2026 at 99.685% of face value. net proceeds from the november 2016 debt issuance were used to repay commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.
total debt to ebitda the company uses the ratio of total debt to ebitda to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. the company believes that total debt to ebitda is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company's long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to ebitda. ebitda and the ratio of total debt to ebitda are non-gaap financial measures. the ratio of total debt to ebitda represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis. total debt to ebitda for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was as follows:

as of december 31, 2016, the company had recorded noncurrent liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $97 million. the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments related to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. the company did not have any significant off-balance sheet commitments at december 31, 2016.
critical accounting policies and estimates the company has six accounting policies that it believes are most important to the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. management bases its estimates on historical experience, and in some cases on observable market information. various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates.
the company's critical accounting policies are as follows:
realizability of inventories- inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. generally, the company's businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to net realizable value based on the following usage criteria:
usage classification   criteria                                                                                   reserve %
active                 quantity on hand is less than prior 6 months of usage                                       0      %
slow-moving            some usage in last 12 months, but quantity on hand exceeds prior 6 months of usage         50      %
obsolete               no usage in the last 12 months                                                             90      %
in addition, for approximately 22% of total inventories, the company has elected to use the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method of inventory costing. generally, this method results in a lower inventory value than the first-in, first-out ("fifo") method due to the effects of inflation.
collectibility of accounts receivable- the company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical write-off percentage over the last two years. in addition, reserves for customer credits and cash discounts are estimated based on past experience.
depreciation of plant and equipment- the company's u.s. businesses primarily compute depreciation on an accelerated basis, as follows:
buildings and improvements   150% declining balance machinery and equipment      200% declining balance the majority of the company's international businesses compute depreciation on a straight-line basis.
income taxes- the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. the company's deferred and other tax balances are based on management's interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous
38
taxing jurisdictions. income tax expense, assets and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable income, the effect of the company's various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions. future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company.
goodwill and intangible assets- the company's business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which are a significant portion of the company's total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the company could incur in future periods. the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. on an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists. if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill. in calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets, management relies on a number of factors, including business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets.
as of december 31, 2016, the company had total goodwill and intangible assets of approximately $6.0 billion allocated to its reporting units. although there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets, the company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets. in addition, the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time, and in many cases have been able to improve their performance, primarily as a result of the application of the company's 80/20 management process. the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately $208 million to $1.4 billion, with the average amount equal to $601 million. fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the company's global end markets, impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods.
pension and other postretirement benefits- the company has various company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a number of u.s. employees and many employees outside the u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations. pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant's years of service, future compensation, and age at retirement or termination. important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets, life expectancy, and health care cost trend rates. future changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the amounts recorded related to the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans. see note 9. pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.
the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the year-end measurement date for the u.s. primary pension plan. the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year. in estimating this rate, the company looks at rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan. a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the u.s. primary pension plan obligation by approximately $39 million.
the expected long-term return on plan assets is based on historical and expected long-term returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes. for the u.s. primary pension plan, a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately $4 million.
beginning in 2017, the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. the new method will provide a more precise measure of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash flows rather than a single weighted-average rate. the change is not expected to have a material impact on the 2017 net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs as the decrease in service and interest costs is largely offset by the impact of lower discount rates and expected returns on plan assets. total estimated 2017 pension and other postretirement benefit costs are expected to be consistent with 2016. see note 9. pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8.

item 1a.    risk factors cautionary statement regarding forward-looking information this annual report on form 10-k contains "forward‐looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. the use of words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "plans" and "believes," among others, generally identify forward‐looking statements. these forward‐looking statements include, among others, statements relating to: iac's future financial performance, iac's business prospects and strategy, anticipated trends and prospects in the industries in which iac's businesses operate and other similar matters. these forward‐looking statements are based on iac management's expectations and assumptions about future events as of the date of this annual report, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.
actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward‐looking statements for a variety of reasons, including, among others, the risk factors set forth below. other unknown or unpredictable factors that could also adversely affect iac's business, financial condition and results of operations may arise from time to time. in light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward‐looking statements discussed in this annual report may not prove to be accurate. accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward‐looking statements, which only reflect the views of iac management as of the date of this annual report. iac does not undertake to update these forward‐looking statements.
risk factors mr. diller and certain members of his family collectively have sole voting and/or investment power over a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock. as a result, mr. diller and these family members are able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our board of directors, matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations.
as of january 27, 2017, mr. diller, his spouse, diane von furstenberg, and his stepson, alexander von furstenberg, collectively beneficially owned 5,789,499 shares of iac class b common stock and 136,711 shares of iac common stock, all of which were held in trusts for the benefit of mr. diller and certain members of his family, and 1,711 shares of iac common stock held by a private foundation. as of that date, the shares of iac class b common stock beneficially owned by mr. diller and certain members of his family collectively represented 100% of iac's outstanding class b common stock and, together with the shares of iac common stock also beneficially owned by these individuals, represented approximately 44.7% of the total outstanding voting power of iac. mr. diller also holds 550,000 vested options and 750,000 unvested options to purchase iac common stock.
in addition, pursuant to an amended and restated governance agreement between iac and mr. diller, for so long as mr. diller serves as iac's chairman and senior executive and he beneficially owns (within the meaning of rule 13d-3 of the securities exchange act of 1934) at least 5,000,000 shares of iac class b common stock and/or common stock in which he has a pecuniary interest (including iac securities beneficially owned by him directly and indirectly through trusts for the benefit of him and certain members of his family), he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that iac's ratio of total debt to ebitda (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve-month period.
as a result of iac securities beneficially owned by mr. diller and certain members of his family, mr. diller and these family members are, collectively, currently in a position to influence, subject to our organizational documents and delaware law, the composition of iac's board of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions. in addition, this concentration of investment and voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to iac, which could adversely affect the market price of iac securities.

we depend on our key personnel.
our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled individuals, with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success. competition for well-qualified employees across iac and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon our ability to attract new employees. while we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, particularly our senior management, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future. effective succession planning is also important to our future success. if we fail to ensure the effective transfer of senior management knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management across our various businesses, our ability to execute short and long term strategic, financial and operating goals, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations generally, could be adversely affected.
we depend upon arrangements with google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to a services agreement with google. pursuant to this agreement, we display and syndicate paid listings provided by google in response to search queries generated by users of our publishing and applications properties. in exchange for making our search traffic available to google, we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us, as well as certain other search‐related services. our current agreement with google expires on march 31, 2020. the company may choose to terminate this agreement effective march 31, 2019.
the amount of revenue we receive from google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the amount google charges for advertisements, the efficiency of google's system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and parameters established by google regarding the number and placement of paid listings displayed in response to search queries. in addition, google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness (to advertisers) of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our publishing and applications properties and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive. google also makes judgments about the relative attractiveness (to users) of paid listings from searches and these judgments factor into the amount of advertisements we can purchase. changes to the amount google charges to advertisers, google's paid listings network efficiency, its judgment about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from our publishing and applications properties or the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings could result in a decrease in the amount of revenue we receive and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. such changes could come about for a number of reasons, including general market conditions, competition or policy and operating decisions made by google.
our services agreement with google also requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by google for the use of its brands and services, including with respect to which products and applications may access google's services, and the manner in which google's paid listings are displayed within search results across various platforms and products. our services agreement also requires that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings, including the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display paid listings. google may generally unilaterally update its own policies and guidelines without advance notice, which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of, our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. noncompliance with google's guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we are permitted to syndicate paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for our applications could, if not cured, result in google's suspension of some or all of its services to our websites or the websites of our third party partners or the termination of the services agreement by google.
the termination of the services agreement by google, the curtailment of iac's rights under the agreement (whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise) or the failure of google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. if any of these events were to occur, we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider (or if an alternate provider were found, the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with, and the paid listings supplied by, google) or otherwise replace the lost revenues.
13
general economic events or trends, particularly those that reduce advertising spending and/or adversely impact consumer confidence, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue (primarily revenue from our applications and publishing segments) is attributable to online advertising. accordingly, we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased advertising expenditures. advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns, as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending.
similarly, some of our businesses (primarily homeadvisor) are particularly sensitive to events and trends that adversely impact consumer confidence and spending behavior. for example, in the event of a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions, consumer confidence, spending levels and credit availability could be adversely affected. the occurrence of any of these events or trends could result in consumers delaying or foregoing home services projects, which could result in a decrease in fees paid by home service professionals for consumer matches, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we could also experience turnover in our network of home services professionals given that a significant number of our home services professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses, and as such, are particularly sensitive to events and trends that adversely impact consumer confidence and spending behavior. while these home services professionals are required to agree that they will operate in accordance with our terms and conditions, we do not enter into long‐term agreements with them. any turnover, if significant or recurring over a prolonged period, could result in a decrease in traffic to our properties and increased costs, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in the recent past, adverse economic conditions have caused, and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause, decreases and/or delays in advertising expenditures and discretionary spending by consumers, which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our success depends, in part, upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising, particularly paid listings, as an effective alternative to traditional, offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the internet.
we continue to compete with traditional advertising media, including television, radio and print, in addition to a multitude of websites with high levels of traffic and online advertising networks, for a share of available advertising expenditures and expect to face continued competition as more emerging media and traditional offline media companies continue to enter the online advertising market. we believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally will depend, to a large extent, on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models (particularly in the case of mobile advertising), the continued growth in commercial use of the internet (particularly abroad), the extent to which web browsers, software programs and/or other applications that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud. any lack of growth in the market for online advertising, particularly for paid listings, or any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising (whether due to changes in laws, changes in industry practices, the emergence of technologies that can block the display of advertisements across platforms or other developments) would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the distribution and use of our products and services depends, in part, on third parties.
we distribute our products and services through a variety of third party publishers and distribution channels. for example, as our users and customers increasingly access our products and services through mobile applications, we (primarily in the case of match group's dating business and apalon, one of the businesses within our applications segment) increasingly depend upon the apple app store and the google play store to distribute our mobile applications. both apple and google have broad discretion to change their respective terms and conditions applicable to the distribution of our mobile applications, and to interpret their respective terms and conditions in ways that may limit, eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to distribute our mobile applications through their stores. we cannot assure you that apple or google will not limit or eliminate or otherwise interfere with the distribution of our mobile applications. if either or both of them did so, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
the use of certain of our products and services also depends, in part, on third parties. for example, users of match group's tinder dating product currently register for (and log in to) tinder exclusively through their facebook profiles. while match group is currently in the process of developing an alternate authentication method that would allow users to register for (and log into) tinder using their mobile phone number, no assurances can be provided that users will use this method versus registering for (and logging into) tinder through their facebook profiles. facebook has broad discretion to change its terms and conditions applicable to the use of its platform and to interpret its terms and conditions in ways that could limit, eliminate or
14
otherwise interfere with our ability to use facebook as an authentication method and if facebook did so and no alternate authentication method is available (or the alternate method match group ultimately develops is not adopted by users), match group's (and in turn, our) business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
lastly, certain of the businesses within our applications and publishing segments have entered into (and expect to continue to enter into) agreements to distribute search boxes, browser extensions and other applications to users through third parties. most of these agreements are either non‐exclusive and short‐term in nature or, in the case of long‐term or exclusive agreements, are terminable by either party in certain specified circumstances. in addition, a few of these agreements collectively represent a significant percentage of the revenue generated by our partnerships business. the inability of these businesses to enter into new (or renew existing) agreements to distribute search boxes, browser extensions and other applications through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in traffic to our various properties, queries and advertising revenue, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our success depends, in part, on our continued ability to introduce new and enhanced content, products and services in response to evolving trends and technologies and that otherwise resonate with our users and customers.
we may not be able to convert traffic into repeat users and customers unless we continue to introduce new and enhanced content, products and services in response to evolving trends and technologies and provide quality products and services that otherwise resonate with our users and customers.
the development of new content, products and services, as well as the identification of new business opportunities in this dynamic environment, require significant time and resources. we may not be able to adapt quickly enough to these changes, appropriately time the introduction of new content, products and services or identify new business opportunities in a timely manner. also, these changes could require us to modify related infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites, applications, services and proprietary technologies obsolete. our failure to respond to any of these changes appropriately and efficiently could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, third parties could continue to develop technologies and policies that may interfere with the ability of users to access or utilize our products and services generally, otherwise make users less likely to use our products and services or interfere with the advertising efforts of our various businesses. for example, third parties have developed technologies that can block the display of online advertisements across platforms (particularly and increasingly in the case with mobile platforms) and that provide users with the ability to opt out of advertising products. in addition, third parties continue to introduce technologies (including new and enhanced web browsers and operating systems) that may limit or prevent certain types of applications from being installed and/or have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that users will install our applications or that previously installed applications will remain in active use. our failure to successfully modify our websites and products in a cost-effective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of new technologies, or our failure to find alternative sources of revenue to support websites and products that currently generate revenue through advertising, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
lastly, while the continued introduction of new content, products and services is critical to our success, by definition, new content, products and services have limited operating histories, which could make it difficult for us to evaluate our current business and future prospects. for example, through match group, we seek to tailor each of our dating products to meet the preferences of specific communities of users. building a given dating product is generally an iterative process that occurs over a meaningful period of time and involves considerable resources and expenditures. although certain of our newer dating products have experienced significant growth over relatively short periods of time, the historical growth rates of these dating products are not necessarily an indicator of future growth rates for our newer dating products generally. we have encountered, and may continue to encounter, risks and difficulties as we build new content, brands and products. the failure to successfully address these risks and difficulties could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or cost-effective.
traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing. we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant expenditures for search engine marketing (primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords, which we purchase primarily through google and, to a lesser extent, microsoft and yahoo!), online display advertising and traditional offline advertising (including television) in connection with these initiatives, which may not be successful or cost-effective. historically, we have had to increase advertising and marketing expenditures over time in order to attract and retain users and customers and sustain our growth.
15
in the case of paid advertising generally, our ability to market our brands on any given property or channel is subject to the policies of the relevant third party seller, publisher of advertising (including through search engines and social networks and platforms) or marketing affiliate. as a result, any such third party could limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising or advertise some of our products and services, which could affect our ability to compete effectively and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we cannot assure you that we will not be limited or prohibited from using certain current or prospective marketing channels in the case of any of our businesses in the future. if this were to happen in the case of a significant marketing channel and/or for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. in addition, if we fail to comply with the policies of third party sellers, publishers of advertising or marketing affiliates, our advertisements could be removed without notice and/or our accounts could be suspended or terminated, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in the case of our search engine marketing and optimization efforts, our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines, as well as changing policies and guidelines applicable to keyword advertising (which may be unilaterally updated by google, microsoft and yahoo! without advance notice), could adversely affect both the placement of paid listings that appear in response to keywords we purchase, the pricing of online advertising we purchase generally and how our websites rank within search results, any or all of which would increase our costs and adversely impact the effectiveness of our advertising efforts overall.
certain of our businesses engage in efforts similar to search engine optimization involving facebook and other social media platforms (for example, developing content designed to appear higher in a given facebook news feed and generate "likes") that involve challenges and risks similar to those faced in connection with our broader search engine marketing and optimization efforts. also, search engines continue to expand their offerings into other, non-search related categories, and in certain instances display their own integrated or related product and service offerings in a more prominent manner than those of third parties within their search results. continued expansion and competition from search engines could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various properties, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
separately, evolving consumer behavior can affect the availability of cost-effective marketing opportunities. for example, as traditional television viewership declines and consumers spend more time on mobile devices rather than desktop computers, the reach of many of traditional online and offline advertising channels is contracting. to continue to reach potential users and customers, we must continue to identify and devote more of our overall marketing expenditures to newer advertising channels, such as mobile and online video platforms, as well as targeted campaigns in which we communicate directly with potential, former and current users via new virtual means. generally, the opportunities in (and sophistication of) newer advertising channels are undeveloped and unproven relative to opportunities in traditional online and offline channels and if we are unable to continue to appropriately manage and fine‐tune our marketing efforts in response to these and other trends in the advertising industry, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
lastly, we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to drive traffic to our various websites and mobile applications, which arrangements are generally more cost-effective than traditional marketing efforts. if we are unable to renew existing (and enter into new) arrangements of this nature, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the long-term.
any failure to attract and acquire new (and retain existing) traffic, users and customers in a cost-effective manner could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
communicating with our users via e-mail is critical to our success, and any erosion in our ability to communicate in this fashion that is not sufficiently replaced by other means could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
primarily in the case of match group's dating business, one of our primary means of communicating with users and customers and keeping them engaged with our products and services is via e-mail. as consumer habits evolve in the era of smart phones and messaging/social networking apps, usage of e-mail, particularly among younger users and customers, has declined. in addition, deliverability and other restrictions imposed by third party e-mail providers and/or applicable law could limit or prevent our ability to send e-mails to our users and customers. a continued and significant erosion in our ability to communicate successfully with our users and customers via e-mail could have an adverse impact on user and customer experience, levels of user engagement and, in the case of match group's dating businesses, the rate at which non‐paying users become paid members. while we continually work to find new means of communicating and connecting with our users and customers (for example, through push notifications), we cannot assure you that such alternative means of communication will
16
be as effective as e-mail has been historically. any failure to develop or take advantage of new means of communication could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our success depends, in part, on our ability to build, maintain and/or enhance our various brands.
through our various businesses, we own and operate a number of widely known consumer brands with strong brand appeal within their respective industries, as well as a number of emerging brands that we are in the process of building. we believe that our success depends, in part, upon our continued ability to maintain and enhance our established brands, as well as build awareness of (and loyalty to) our emerging brands. our brands and brand-building efforts could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including product and service quality concerns, consumer complaints, actions brought by consumers, governmental or regulatory authorities and related media coverage and data protection and security breaches. moreover, the failure to market our products and services successfully (or in a cost-effective manner), the inability to develop and introduce products and services that resonate with consumers and/or the inability to adapt quickly enough (and/or in a cost effective manner) to evolving changes in the internet and related technologies, applications and devices, could adversely impact our various brands and brand-building efforts, and in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations.
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.
we operate in various international markets, primarily in various jurisdictions within the european union, and as result are exposed to foreign exchange risk for both the euro and british pound ("gbp"). during the fiscal years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 26% of our total revenues were international revenues. we translate international revenues into u.s. dollar-denominated operating results and during periods of a strengthening u.s. dollar, our international revenues will be reduced when translated into u.s. dollars. in addition, as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, the translation of our international revenues into u.s. dollar-denominated operating results affects the period-over-period comparability of such results.
our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the u.s. dollar, primarily the euro. since the average euro versus the u.s. dollar exchange rate in 2016 was essentially flat compared to 2015, the translation of our international results into u.s. dollars did not significantly reduce our revenue nor did it have a significant effect on the period-over-period comparability of our u.s dollar-denominated operating results for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2016 versus december 31, 2015. to the extent that the u.s. dollar continues to strengthen relative to the euro, the translation of our international revenues into u.s. dollars will reduce our u.s. dollar-denominated operating results and will affect their period-over-period comparability.
fluctuating foreign exchange rates can also result in foreign currency exchange gains and losses. while foreign currency exchange gains and losses historically have not been material to the company, the significant decline in the gbp due to the brexit vote on june 23, 2016 generated significant foreign currency exchange gains during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2016. see "item 7a-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk-foreign currency exchange risk."
historically, we have not hedged any foreign currency exposures. the continued growth and expansion of our international operations into new countries increases our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in the case of one currency or collectively with other currencies, could adversely affect our future results of operations.
as the distribution of our dating products through app stores increases, in order to maintain our profit margins, we may need to offset increasing app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures, increasing user volume or monetization per user or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally, or our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
as users of our dating products continue to shift to mobile solutions, we increasingly rely upon the apple app store and the google play store to distribute our mobile applications. for example, while our mobile dating applications are generally free to download from these stores, we offer our users the opportunity to purchase paid memberships and certain à la carte features through these applications. we determine the prices at which these memberships and features are sold and, in exchange for facilitating the purchase of these memberships and features through these applications to users who download our applications from these stores, we pay apple and google, as applicable, a share (generally 30%) of the revenue we receive from these transactions. as the distribution of our dating products through app stores increases, we may need to offset these increased app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures as a percentage of revenue, increasing user volume or monetization per user, or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally, or our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
17
our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services.
our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services. while many of our users continue to access our products and services through personal computers, users of (and usage volumes on) mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, continue to increase relative to those of personal computers. while we have developed mobile versions of certain of our products and services (and have developed certain products and services exclusively for mobile devices) and intend to continue to do so in the future, we may not be able to monetize these applications as effectively as we monetize our non-mobile products and services.
in addition, the success of our mobile applications is dependent on their interoperability with various mobile operating systems, technologies, networks and standards that we do not control and any changes in any of these things that compromise the quality or functionality of our products and services could adversely impact usage of our products and services on mobile devices and, in turn, our ability to attract advertisers. our failure or inability to successfully respond to the general shift of users and customers to mobile devices could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
each of our dating products monetizes users at different rates. if a meaningful migration of our user base from our higher monetizing dating products to our lower monetizing dating products were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
through match group, we own, operate and manage a large and diverse portfolio of dating products. each dating product has its own mix of free and paid features designed to optimize the user experience for, and revenue generation from, that product's community of users. in general, the mix of features for the various dating products within our more established brands leads to higher monetization rates per user than the mix of features for the various dating products within our newer brands. if a significant portion of our user base were to migrate to our less profitable brands, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
our success depends, in part, on the integrity and quality of our systems and infrastructures and those of third parties. system interruptions and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may affect our business.
to succeed, our systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis. from time to time, we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or that prevent us from providing products and services; any such interruption could arise for any number of reasons. furthermore, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, acts of god and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer, data, broadband or other communications systems at any time. any event of this nature could cause system interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers. while we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations, our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities. in addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption. any such interruptions or outages, regardless of the cause, could negatively impact the experiences of our users and customers with our products and services, tarnish our brands' reputation and decrease demand for our products and services, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we also continually work to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of our technology and network systems to improve the experiences of our users and customers, accommodate substantial increases in the volume of traffic to our properties, ensure acceptable page load times and keep up with changes in technology and user and customer preferences. any failure to do so in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely affect the experiences of our users and customers with our products and services and thereby negatively impact demand for our products and services, and could increase our costs, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we also rely on third party computer systems, data center service providers, cloud-based web hosting services, broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of our products and services generally, as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users and customers. we have no control over any of these third parties or their operations.
any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers, changes in service levels provided by these systems or deterioration in the performance of these systems, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and/or process certain transactions with users and customers. if any of these events were to occur, it could damage
18
our reputation and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy.
we may not be able to protect our systems, infrastructures and technologies from cyberattacks. in addition, we may be adversely impacted by cyberattacks experienced by third parties. any disruption of our systems, infrastructures and technologies, or compromise of our user data or other information, due to cyberattacks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are regularly under attack by perpetrators of malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software, distributed denial of service attacks, attempts to misappropriate customer information (including credit card information) or other malicious activities. events of this nature could compromise the integrity of our systems, infrastructures and technologies, as well as the products and services offered by our various businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our users and customers. the incidence of events of this nature (or any combination thereof) is on the rise worldwide.
while we continuously develop and maintain systems to detect and prevent events of this nature from impacting our various businesses (and their respective systems, infrastructures, technologies, products, services, users and customers), and have invested (and continue to invest) heavily in these efforts and related training, these efforts are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome preventative security measures become more sophisticated. despite our efforts, we cannot assure you that we will not experience significant events of this nature in the future and if such an event does occur, that it will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
any cyberattack or security breach we experience could damage our systems, infrastructures and technologies and/or those of our users and customers, prevent us from providing our products and services, compromise the integrity of our products and services, damage our reputation, erode our brands and/or be costly to remedy, as well as subject us to investigations by regulatory authorities and/or litigation that could result in liability to third parties. even if we do not experience such events, the impact of any such events experienced by third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations) could have a similar effect. moreover, even cyberattacks and security breaches that do not impact us directly may result in a loss of consumer confidence generally, which could make consumers and users less likely to use our products and services.
in addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses resulting from any of these events.
if the security of personal and confidential user information, including credit card information, that we maintain and store is breached or otherwise accessed by unauthorized persons, it may be costly to mitigate the impact of such an event, our reputation could be harmed and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
we receive, process, store and transmit a significant amount of personal user and other confidential information, including credit card information, and enable our users to share their personal information with each other. in some cases, we retain third party vendors to store this information. we continuously develop and maintain systems to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of this information, but cannot guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts. if any such event were to occur, we may not be able to remedy the event, and we may have to expend significant capital and resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring. if a breach of our security (or the security of our vendors and partners) occurs, the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and our reputation may be harmed, we could lose current and potential users and the recognition of our various brands and their competitive positions could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to a number of risks related to credit card payments, including data security breaches and fraud that we or third parties experience or additional regulation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our various businesses accept payment from our users and customers primarily through credit card transactions and certain online payment service providers. the ability of these businesses to access credit card information on a real time‐basis without having to proactively reach out to the consumer each time they process a payment for products and services (including auto‐renewal payments or payments for the purchase of a premium feature on or with any of our products or services) is critical to our success.

when we experience (or a third party experiences) a data security breach involving credit card information, affected cardholders will often cancel their credit cards. in the case of a breach experienced by a third party, the more sizable the third party's customer base and the greater the number of credit card accounts impacted, the more likely it is that our users and customers would be impacted by such a breach. to the extent our users and customers are ever affected by such a breach experienced by us or a third party, affected individuals would need to be contacted to obtain new credit card information and process any pending transactions. it is likely that we would not be able to reach all affected individuals, and even if we could, new credit card information for some individuals may not be obtained and some pending transactions may not be processed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
even if our users and customers are not directly impacted by a given data security breach, they may lose confidence in the ability of service providers to protect their personal information generally, which could cause them to stop using their credit cards online and choose alternative payment methods that are not as convenient for us or restrict our ability to process payments without significant user and customer effort.
additionally, if we fail to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face litigation, fines, governmental enforcement action, civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures, significantly higher credit card‐related costs and substantial remediation costs, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
finally, the passage or adoption of any legislation or regulation affecting the ability of service providers to periodically charge users and customers for recurring membership payments may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights and compliance with laws designed to prevent unauthorized access of personal data could be costly.
we receive, transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other user data (including personal credit card data, as well as private content (such as videos and correspondence)) in connection with the processing of search queries, the provision of online products and services, transactions with users and customers and advertising on our websites. the sharing, storage, use, disclosure and protection of this information are determined by the respective privacy and data security policies of our various businesses. these policies are, in turn, subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as evolving industry standards and practices, regarding privacy generally and the sharing, storage, use disclosure and protection of personal information and user data. these laws, regulations, standards and practices are changing, inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations, and new laws, regulations, standards and practices of this nature are adopted from time to time.
for example, in 2016, the european commission: (i) and the united states reached an agreement on a new framework for transfers of personal data, the eu-u.s. privacy shield, which provides a safe harbor for u.s. companies that transfer data from the eu to the u.s. and (ii) adopted the general data protection regulation (the "gdpr"), a comprehensive european union privacy and data protection reform that will become effective in may 2018 and will supersede the european union data protection directive (the "eu directive") currently in place. the gdpr imposes stricter standards regarding the sharing, storage, use, disclosure and protection of end user data and increased penalties for non-compliance relative to the eu directive. in addition, the potential exit from the european union by the united kingdom could result in the application of new and conflicting data privacy and protection laws and standards to our operations in the united kingdom and our handling our personal data of users located in the united kingdom. in addition, there are a number of draft privacy laws and regulations under consideration in the u.s. (including in various states) and in various foreign jurisdictions in which we do business.
while we believe that we comply with applicable privacy policies, laws and regulations, as well as evolving industry standards and practices relating to privacy and data security in all material respects, there is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws and regulations, standard and practices, that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims or that we will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event of non-compliance. moreover, any failure or perceived failure by us (or the third parties with whom we have contracted to handle such information) to comply with applicable privacy laws, privacy policies or privacy‐related contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to personal information could result in governmental enforcement actions, significant fines, litigation, claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity. in the case of such an event, our reputation may be harmed, we could lose current and potential users and the competitive positions of our various brands could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
20
lastly, compliance with the numerous privacy and data protection laws in the various countries in which our businesses operate (particularly the gdpr) could be costly, particularly as these laws become more comprehensive in scope, more commonplace and continue to evolve. if these costs are significant, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
our indebtedness may affect our ability to operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness.
as of december 31, 2016, we had total debt outstanding of approximately $1.6 billion, including $1.2 billion of total debt outstanding at match group. as of this date, we had borrowing availability of $300 million, and match group had borrowing availability of $500 million, under our respective revolving credit facilities. neither match group nor any of its subsidiaries guarantee any indebtedness of iac or are subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness. similarly, neither iac nor any of its subsidiaries (other than match group and its subsidiaries) guarantee any indebtedness of match group or are subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness.
our indebtedness and match group's indebtedness could have important consequences, such as:
•   limiting our respective abilities to obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures or other debt service requirements or for other purposes;
•   limiting our respective abilities to use operating cash flow in other areas of our respective businesses because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service debt;
•   limiting our respective abilities to compete with other companies who are not as highly leveraged, as we may be less capable of responding to adverse economic and industry conditions;
•   restricting us from making strategic acquisitions, developing properties or exploiting business opportunities;
•   restricting the way in which we conduct business because of financial and operating covenants in the agreements governing our respective existing and future indebtedness;
•   exposing us to potential events of default (if not cured or waived) under financial and operating covenants contained in our or our respective subsidiaries' debt instruments that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results;
•   increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in pricing of our products and services; and
•   limiting our respective abilities to react to changing market conditions in the various industries in which we do business.
in addition to our respective debt service obligations, our and match group's operations require substantial investments on a continuing basis. our ability or the ability of match group to make scheduled debt payments, to refinance obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to fund capital and non‐capital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our respective operating assets and properties, as well as to provide capacity for the growth of our respective businesses, depends on our respective financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legal and other factors.
subject to certain restrictions in the agreements governing our and match group's indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness. although the terms of agreements governing our and match group's indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be significant. if new debt is added to our or our subsidiaries' current debt levels, the risks described above could increase. also, in the event a default has occurred or our leverage ratio exceeds thresholds specified in the agreements governing our indebtedness, our ability to pay dividends or to make distributions and repurchase or redeem our stock would be limited and the agreements governing match group's indebtedness contain similar restrictions. see "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-financial position, liquidity and capital resources-financial position."
21
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our current and planned indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful.
our ability and the ability of match group to satisfy our respective debt obligations will depend upon, among other things:
•   our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control; and
•   our future ability and the future ability of match group to borrow under our respective revolving credit agreements, the availability of which will depend on, among other things, compliance with the covenants in the then‐existing agreements governing such indebtedness.
there can be no assurance that we or match group will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that we or match group will be able to draw under our respective revolving credit agreements or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our respective liquidity needs. see also "-we may not freely access the cash of match group and its subsidiaries" below.
if cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. in addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. in the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations, sell equity, and/or negotiate with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt, in order to meet our debt service and other obligations. we may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all. the agreements governing our and match group's indebtedness may restrict, or market or business conditions may limit, our ability to avail ourselves of some or all of these options. furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due.
we may not freely access the cash of match group and its subsidiaries.
the company's potential sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries, availability under iac's revolving credit facility and proceeds from asset sales, including marketable securities. the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject.  agreements governing match group's indebtedness limit the payment of dividends or the making of distributions, loans or advances to stockholders, including iac. in addition, because match group is a separate and distinct legal entity with public shareholders, it has no obligation to provide us with funds for payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments.
you may experience dilution with respect to your investment in iac, and iac may experience dilution with respect to its investment in match group, as a result of the settlement of equity awards.
our dilutive securities consist of vested and unvested options to purchase shares of our common stock, restricted stock unit awards and vested and unvested stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights denominated in the equity of certain of our consolidated subsidiaries, including tinder and other match group subsidiaries ("subsidiary awards"). for more information regarding subsidiary awards, see "note 13-stock-based compensation" to the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8-consolidated financial statements and supplementary data."
these dilutive securities are reflected in our share calculations underlying our dilutive earnings per share calculation contained in our financial statements for fiscal years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. see "note 12-earnings per share" to the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8-consolidated financial statements and supplementary data." intra-quarter movements in our stock price, as well as variances between the estimated fair value of our subsidiaries used to calculate such fully-diluted share calculations (which estimated fair value may change from time-to-time and quarter-to-quarter) and the fair value determined in connection with the liquidity events related to subsidiary awards, could lead to more or less dilution than reflected in these calculations.
22
the issuance of shares of iac common stock in settlement of subsidiary awards could dilute your ownership interest in iac.  subsidiary awards related to match group subsidiaries may be settled in shares of iac common stock or match group common stock, at our option. in the event we elect to settle these match group subsidiary awards in shares of match group common stock (rather than in shares of iac common stock), our ownership stake in match group would be diluted.  this dilution could impact our ability, among other things, to maintain match group as part of our consolidated tax group for u.s. federal income tax purposes, to effect a tax-free distribution of our match group stake to our stockholders or to maintain control of match group. as we generally have the right to maintain our level of ownership in match group to the extent match group issues additional shares of its capital stock in the future pursuant to an investor rights agreement, we do not intend to allow any of the foregoing to occur.
in addition to the dilution resulting from the issuance of shares of iac common stock (or match group common stock) in settlement of subsidiary equity awards, the holders of the subsidiary equity awards may choose to sell the shares of iac common stock (or match group common stock) they receive in settlement of their subsidiary awards into the open market immediately.  if sales are significant and concentrated, they could have a temporary impact on the trading value of our stock (or on match group common stock).
variable rate indebtedness will subject us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.
match group currently has $350 million of indebtedness outstanding under its term loan. borrowings under the term loan are, and any borrowings under match group's revolving credit facility will be, at variable rates of interest. indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates exposes us to interest rate risk. match group's term loan bears interest at libor plus 3.25%. as of december 31, 2016, the rate in effect was 4.20%. if libor were to increase by 100 basis points, then the annual interest and expense payments on the outstanding balance as of december 31, 2016 on the term loan would have increased by $3.5 million. if libor were to decrease by 100 basis points, then the effective interest rate would decrease by 20 basis points to the libor floor of 0.75% and the annual interest expense and payments in the current year would decrease by $0.7 million. see also "item 7a-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and even if we do so, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions. in addition, some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value.
we have made numerous acquisitions in the past and we continue to seek to identify potential acquisition candidates that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities, as well as maximize our existing assets. as a result, our future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on satisfactory pricing or other terms and we expect to continue to experience competition in connection with our acquisition-related efforts.
even if we identify what we believe to be suitable acquisition candidates and negotiate satisfactory terms, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions, and to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions, we will need to:
•   properly value prospective acquisitions, especially those with limited operating histories;
•   successfully integrate the operations, as well as the accounting, financial controls, management information, technology, human resources and other administrative systems, of acquired businesses with our existing operations and systems;
•   successfully identify and realize potential synergies among acquired and existing businesses;
•   retain or hire senior management and other key personnel at acquired businesses; and
•   successfully manage acquisition‐related strain on the management, operations and financial resources of iac and its businesses and/or acquired businesses.
we may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions. in addition, the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in increased operating losses, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities. also, the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events and/or trends, which could result in significant impairment charges. the occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
23
we operate in various international markets, some in which we have limited experience. as a result, we face additional risks in connection with our international operations. also, we may not be able to successfully expand into new, or further into our existing, international markets.
we currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence. in order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance, commercial use and acceptance of the internet (particularly via mobile devices) must continue to grow, which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the united states. moreover, we must continue to successfully tailor our products and services to the unique customs and cultures of foreign jurisdictions, which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
operating abroad, particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience, exposes us to additional risks. these additional risks include, among others:
•   operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;
•   difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;
•   differing levels of social and technological acceptance of our products and services or lack of acceptance of them generally;
•   foreign currency fluctuations;
•   restrictions on the transfer of funds among countries and back to the united states and costs associated with repatriating funds to the united states;
•   differing and potentially adverse tax laws;
•   multiple, conflicting and changing laws, rules and regulations, and difficulties understanding and ensuring compliance with those laws by both our employees and our business partners, over whom we exert no control;
•   competitive environments that favor local businesses;
•   limitations on the level of intellectual property protection; and
•   trade sanctions, political unrest, terrorism, war and epidemics or the threat of any of these events.
the occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our success in international markets will also depend, in part, on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates, joint venture or other partners, and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms and successfully integrate their businesses and operations with our own.
a variety of new laws, or new interpretations of existing laws, could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.
we are subject to a variety of laws in the u.s. and abroad that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, and can subject us to claims or other remedies. some of these laws, such as income, sales, use, value‐added and other tax laws and consumer protection laws, are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the various types of businesses in which we are engaged. many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies. laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain. in addition, evolving internet business practices may attract increased legal and regulatory attention. for example, the u.s. federal trade commission has indicated that it will continue to monitor the use of online "native" advertising (a form of advertising in which sponsored content is presented in a manner that some may view as similar to traditional editorial content) to ensure that it is presented in a manner that is not confusing or deceptive to consumers.
any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests, or if new adverse laws are adopted, our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws, which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to our customers. specifically, in the case of tax laws, positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities. while we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law, there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position, and if so, that such positions will not adversely affect us. any events of this nature could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
moreover, laws that regulate the practices of third parties may also adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. for example, the open internet order adopted by the u.s. federal communications commission (the "fcc") in may 2016 codified "network neutrality," the principle that internet service providers should treat all data traveling
24
through their networks the same, not discriminating or charging differentially by content, website, platform or application. the open internet order's rules could be vacated by the courts in connection with a legal challenge to the fcc's authority to adopt the order, repealed by the fcc or overruled by the u.s. congress. if this were to occur, broadband internet access providers could discriminate against internet traffic of our businesses in favor of others or charge our businesses to provide their services to users and consumers via their networks, which could increase our costs and would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties.
we rely heavily upon our trademarks and related domain names and logos to market our brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition, as well as upon trade secrets. we also rely, to a lesser extent, upon patented and patent‐pending proprietary technologies with expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2038.
we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights. for example, we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew, or secure by contract where appropriate, trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate. effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract. similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered, even if available.
we also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate, based on then current facts and circumstances, and will continue to do so in the future. no assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed (or will file) will result in a patent being issued, or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies. in addition, no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own.
despite these measures, our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner, challenges to contractual rights could arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization. the occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names, as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
from time to time, we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties. in addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive.
our estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay.
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous jurisdictions abroad. significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related matters. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation. our determination of our income tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities and we are currently subject to audits in a number of jurisdictions. although we believe our income tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate, relevant taxing authorities may disagree. the ultimate outcome of any such audits and reviews could be materially different from estimates and determinations reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

•   direct revenue - is revenue that is directly received by match group from an end user of its products.
•   average pmc - is calculated by summing the number of paid members, or paid member count ("pmc"), at the end of each day in the relevant measurement period and dividing it by the number of calendar days in that period. pmc as of any given time represents the number of users with a paid membership at that time.
•   average revenue per paying user ("arppu") - is direct revenue from members in the relevant measurement period (whether in the form of subscription payments or à la carte payments) divided by the average pmc in such period divided by the number of calendar days in such period. this definition has been updated in the fourth quarter of 2016 to exclude non-subscriber direct revenue and previously reported arppu has been adjusted to conform to this definition.
•   service requests - are fully completed and submitted customer service requests on homeadvisor.
•   paying service professionals ("paying sps") - are the number of service professionals that had an active membership and/or paid for leads in the last month of the period.

31
cost of products sold and shipping and handling costs, production costs related to media produced by electus and other businesses within our video segment, expenses associated with the operation of the company's data centers, consisting compensation (including stock-based compensation) and other employee-related costs, hosting fees, credit card processing fees, content acquisition costs and rent.
•   selling and marketing expense - consists primarily of advertising expenditures and compensation (including stock-based compensation) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in selling and marketing, sales support and customer service functions. advertising expenditures include online marketing, including fees paid to search engines and third parties that distribute our consumer downloadable desktop applications, offline marketing, which is primarily television advertising, and partner-related payments to those who direct traffic to the match group brands.

•   product development expense - consists primarily of compensation (including stock-based compensation) and other employee-related costs, to the extent that they are not capitalized, for personnel engaged in the design, development, testing and enhancement of product offerings and related technology.
•   acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments - relate to the portion of the purchase price (of certain acquisitions) that is contingent upon the future operating performance of the acquired company. the amounts ultimately paid are generally dependent upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics as stipulated in the relevant purchase agreements. the fair value of the liability is estimated at the date of acquisition and adjusted each reporting period until the liability is settled. if the payment date of the liability is longer than one year, the amount is initially recorded net of a discount, which is amortized as an expense each period. in a period where the acquired company is expected to perform better than the previous estimate, the liability will be increased resulting in additional expense; and in a period when the acquired company is expected to perform worse than the previous estimate, the liability will be decreased resulting in income. the year-over-year impact can be significant, for example, if there is income in one period and expense in the other period.

management overview iac is a leading media and internet company comprised of widely known consumer brands, such as homeadvisor, vimeo, dictionary.com, the daily beast, investopedia, and match group's online dating portfolio, which includes match, tinder, plentyoffish and okcupid.
sources of revenue match group's dating revenue is primarily derived directly from users in the form of recurring membership fees, which typically provide unlimited access to a bundle of features for a specific period of time, and the balances from à la carte features, where users pay a fee for a specific action or event; with additional revenue generated from online advertisers who pay to reach our large audiences. non-dating revenue is primarily earned from fees received directly from students for in-person and online test preparation classes, access to online test preparation materials and individual tutoring services.
homeadvisor's revenue is derived primarily from fees paid by members of its network of home services professionals for consumer leads and memberships.
a significant portion of the revenue from our applications and publishing segments is derived from online advertising, most of which is attributable to our services agreement with google inc. ("google"). the company's service agreement became effective on april 1, 2016, following the expiration of the previous services agreement. the services agreement expires on march 31, 2020; however, the company may choose to terminate the agreement effective march 31, 2019. the services agreement requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by google. google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice; which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, revenue earned from google was $824.4 million, $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, google revenue represents 87% and 73%; 94% and 83%; and 97% and 83%, of applications and publishing revenue, respectively.
the revenue earned by our video segment is derived from media production and distribution, subscriptions and advertising.
shoebuy's revenue was derived principally from merchandise sales. pricerunner's revenue was derived principally from advertising.
strategic partnerships, advertiser relationships and online advertising a meaningful portion of the company's revenue is attributable to the services agreement with google described above. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, revenue earned from google represents 26%, 40% and 45%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue.
we pay traffic acquisition costs, which consist of payments made to partners who distribute our partnerships customized browser-based applications, integrate our paid listings into their websites and fees related to the distribution and facilitation of in-app purchases of product features. we also pay to market and distribute our services on third-party distribution channels, such as search engines and social media websites. in addition, some of our businesses manage affiliate programs, pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned. these distribution channels might also offer their own products and services, as well as those of other third parties, which compete with those we offer.
we market and offer our products and services directly to consumers through branded websites and subscriptions, allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner. we have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses.
the cost of acquiring new consumers through online and offline third-party distribution channels has increased, particularly in the case of online channels, as internet commerce continues to grow and competition in the markets in which iac's businesses operate increases.
2016 developments during 2016, the company:
33
•   repurchased 6.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of $49.98 per share, or $315.3 million in aggregate; and
•   redeemed and repurchased $109.8 million of its 2013 senior notes and repurchased $16.6 million of its 2012 senior notes.
on december 30, 2016, shoebuy, which was part of the other segment, was sold for approximately $70.0 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $37.5 million.

on november 3, 2016, homeadvisor acquired a controlling interest in myhammer holding ag ("myhammer"), the leading home services marketplace in germany.
on june 30, 2016, askfm, which was part of the publishing segment, was sold resulting in a pre-tax loss of $3.8 million.
on june 1, 2016, match group issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior notes due june 1, 2024. the proceeds were used to prepay a portion of the match group term loan.
on may 2, 2016, vimeo, which is part of the video segment, acquired vhx, a platform for premium over-the-top subscription video channels.
on march 18, 2016, pricerunner, which was part of the other segment, was sold for $96.6 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $12.0 million.
2016 consolidated results in 2016, the company's revenue decreased 3% and operating income declined $212.2 million to a loss of $32.6 million; however, the company delivered 3% adjusted ebitda growth. revenue declined due primarily to significant decreases from publishing and applications, partially offset by strong growth at match group and homeadvisor. the operating income decline, despite higher adjusted ebitda, was due primarily to increases of $261.3 million in goodwill impairment charges, $9.5 million in depreciation and a change of $18.0 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, partially offset by a decrease of $60.5 million in amortization of intangibles. the increase in goodwill impairment charges is due to the write-off of goodwill of $275.4 million at publishing in the current year period compared to the write-off of goodwill of $14.1 million at shoebuy in the prior year period. the change in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments reflects expense in the current year period of $2.6 million versus income of $15.5 million in the prior year period. the decrease in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to a reduction in impairment charges during the year. the company recorded in 2016 an impairment charge of $11.6 million compared to an impairment charge in 2015 of $88.0 million all related to certain publishing indefinite-lived trade names. the adjusted ebitda increase was primarily driven by strong growth from match group and homeadvisor and reduced losses from video, partially offset by declines of $95.4 million and $52.0 million from publishing and applications, respectively.

for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
match group revenue increased 20% driven by a 23% increase in dating revenue attributable to higher average pmc at both north america and international, up 22% and 46%, respectively, due primarily to growth in paying members at tinder and the contribution from the 2015 acquisition of plentyoffish. this revenue growth was partially offset by a 6% decline in arppu. north america and international arppu decreased 5% and 7%, respectively, due primarily to the continued mix shift towards lower arppu brands, including tinder and plentyoffish, which have lower price points compared to match group's more established brands. north america arppu decline was partially offset by an increase in mix-adjusted rates. non-dating revenue decreased 6% reflecting fewer in-person sat test preparation courses and in-person tutoring sessions, partially offset by an increase in online and self-paced services.
homeadvisor revenue increased 38% due primarily to 44% growth at the domestic business and 18% growth at the international business. domestic revenue growth was driven by a 41% increase in paying sps and a 34% increase in service requests. international revenue growth was driven by organic growth across all regions as well as the acquisition of a controlling interest in myhammer on november 3, 2016.
video revenue increased 7% due primarily to growth at electus, vimeo and daily burn, partially offset by lower revenue from iac films as the prior year benefited from the release of the movie while we're young.
applications revenue decreased 21% due to a 39% decline in partnerships and a 12% decline in consumer. partnerships revenue decreased due primarily to the loss of certain partners. the consumer decline was driven by lower search revenue from our downloadable desktop applications due primarily to lower monetization, partially offset by strong growth at apalon and slimware, which together comprised 12% of total applications revenue in 2016.
35
publishing revenue decreased 41% due to 54% lower ask & other revenue and 25% lower premium brands revenue. ask & other revenue decreased due to a decline in revenue at ask.com primarily as a result of the new google contract, which became effective april 1, 2016, as well as declines from certain other legacy businesses. premium brands revenue decreased due primarily to declines in paid search traffic at about.com, mainly attributable to the new google contract, partially offset by strong growth at investopedia and the daily beast.
other revenue decreased 3% due to the sale of pricerunner on march 18, 2016, partially offset by growth at shoebuy.
for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014
match group revenue increased 15%, or 20% excluding the effects of foreign exchange, driven by a 9% increase in dating revenue attributable to 8% growth in direct revenue. direct revenue growth was primarily driven by higher average pmc at both north america and international, up 13% and 31%, respectively, due mainly to tinder, partially offset by 9% lower arppu due to brand mix shifts and foreign exchange effects. excluding foreign exchange effects, total dating revenue and international direct revenue would have increased 15% and 21%, respectively. non-dating revenue increased 114% principally due to the full year contribution from the princeton review, which was acquired on august 1, 2014.
see "iac's principles of financial reporting" for a discussion and reconciliation of effects of foreign exchange on match group revenue.

for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
product development expense in 2016 increased from 2015 due to increases of $15.7 million from match group and $2.3 million from publishing, partially offset by a decrease of $6.6 million from applications.
•   the match group increase was primarily related to an increase of $7.6 million in stock-based compensation expense, increased headcount at tinder, and the 2015 acquisitions of plentyoffish and eureka. the increase in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to the issuance of new equity awards and a net increase in expense associated with the modification of certain equity awards since the prior year period.
•   the publishing increase was due primarily to $1.2 million in restructuring charges related to severance costs in connection with a reduction in workforce.
•   the applications decrease was due primarily to a decrease of $4.4 million in compensation due, in part, to a decrease in headcount related to a reduction in workforce that took place in the first half of 2016.
for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014
product development expense in 2015 increased from 2014 due to increases of $17.6 million from match group and $5.5 million from homeadvisor.
•   the match group increase was due primarily to increased compensation at existing businesses and from acquisitions at dating, as well as $4.0 million in severance expense in 2015, primarily incurred in the first half of 2015, related to the consolidation and streamlining of technology systems and european operations at our dating business.
•   the homeadvisor increase was primarily related to an increase in compensation in the domestic business due, in part, to increased headcount.

nm = not meaningful for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
operating income in 2016 decreased to a loss from 2015 despite an increase of $15.4 million in adjusted ebitda described below, due primarily to increases of $261.3 million in goodwill impairment charges, $9.5 million in depreciation and a change of $18.0 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, partially offset by a decrease of $60.5 million in amortization of intangibles. the increase in goodwill impairment charges is due to the write-off of goodwill of $275.4 million at publishing in the current year period compared to the write-off of goodwill of $14.1 million at shoebuy in the prior year period. the goodwill impairment charge at publishing was driven by the impact from the new google contract, traffic trends and monetization challenges and the corresponding impact on the current estimate of fair value. the goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the second quarter of 2016. the change in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments was primarily the result of expense in the current year period of $2.6 million versus income of $15.5 million in the prior year period. the decrease in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to a reduction in impairment charges during the year, partially offset by $23.3 million in amortization related to a change in classification of a publishing trade name from an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a definite-lived intangible asset, effective april 1, 2016. the company recorded an impairment charge in 2016 of $11.6 million compared to an impairment charge in 2015 of $88.0 million all related to certain publishing indefinite-lived trade names.

for a detailed description of the publishing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, see "note 2-summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8-consolidated financial statements and supplementary data."
at december 31, 2016, there was $177.9 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.6 years.
for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014
operating income in 2015 decreased from 2014 due to the decrease of $58.3 million in adjusted ebitda described below and increases of $82.0 million in amortization of intangibles, $45.8 million in stock-based compensation expense and a $14.1 million goodwill impairment charge at shoebuy, partially offset by an increase in income of $2.1 million in changes from acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments compared to 2014. the increase in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to an $88.0 million impairment charge related to certain trade names of certain ask & other direct marketing brands, including ask.com. the impairment charge reflected the impact of google ecosystem changes that have impacted our ability to market, the effect of the reduced revenue share on mobile under the terms of the services agreement with google, and the shift in focus to higher margin businesses in publishing's premium brands. the combined impact of these factors has reduced the forecasted revenue and profits for these brands and the impairment charge reflected the resultant reduction in fair value. the increase in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to the modification of certain equity awards in 2015, a higher number of forfeited awards in 2014 and issuance of equity awards since 2014. the goodwill impairment charge at shoebuy was due to increased investment and the seasonal effect of high inventory levels as of october 1, 2015, the date of our 2015 annual assessment.

interest expense in 2016 increased from 2015 due to the $800 million of borrowings under the match group term loan in november 2015, of which $400 million was refinanced on june 1, 2016 with the 2016 match group senior notes, and the 2% higher interest rate associated with the 2015 match group senior notes which were issued in exchange for a substantially like amount of 2012 senior notes, partially offset by the repurchases and redemptions of the 2013 and 2012 senior notes during the year.

in 2015, the company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of $29.5 million, which represents an effective income tax rate of 21%. the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the realization of certain deferred tax assets, foreign income taxed at lower rates, the non-taxable gain on contingent consideration fair value adjustments, and a reduction in tax reserves and related interest due to the expiration of statutes of limitations, partially offset by a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and unbenefited losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries.
in 2014, the company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of $35.4 million, which represents an effective income tax rate of 13%. the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35% due principally to a reduction in tax reserves and related interest of $88.2 million due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for federal income taxes for 2001 through 2009 and foreign income taxed at lower rates, partially offset by the largely unbenefited loss associated with the write-downs of certain of the company's investments and non-deductible goodwill associated with the sale of urbanspoon.

iac's principles of financial reporting iac reports adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. we believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. this non-gaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results. iac endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-gaap measure presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-gaap measure. we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and non-gaap measure, which we discuss below.
definition of iac's non-gaap measure adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted ebitda") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements. we believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments, and this measure is one of the primary metrics by which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to iac's statement of operations of certain expenses.
for a reconciliation of operating income (loss) by reportable segment and net (loss) earnings attributable to iac shareholders to adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, see "note 14-segment information" to the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8-consolidated financial statements and supplementary data."
non-cash expenses that are excluded from iac's non-gaap measure stock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants of stock options, restricted stock units ("rsus"), performance-based rsus and market-based awards. these expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method; however, performance-based rsus and market-based awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market condition(s) has been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period). upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of rsus, performance-based rsus and market-based awards, the awards are settled, at the company's discretion, on a net basis, with the company remitting the required tax-withholding amount from its current funds.
depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.
amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions. at the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as trade names, content, technology, customer lists, advertiser and supplier relationships, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.
gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value. these adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business.
effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on match group revenue the impact of foreign exchange rates on match group, due to its global reach, may be an important factor in understanding period over period comparisons if movement in rates is significant. international revenues are favorably
45
impacted as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the u.s dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. we believe the presentation of revenue excluding foreign exchange, in addition to reported revenue, helps improve the ability to understand match group's performance because it excludes the impact of foreign currency volatility that is not indicative of match group's core operating results.
revenue, excluding foreign exchange impact compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. revenue, excluding foreign exchange impact is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates. revenue growth, excluding foreign exchange impact (expressed as a percentage), is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates.
this non-gaap measure should be considered in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap.
the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on match group revenue was not material to the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015.

(a)   domestically, cash equivalents primarily consist of aaa rated government money market funds, commercial paper rated a1/p1 or better and treasury discount notes.
(b)   internationally, cash equivalents primarily consist of aaa rated treasury money market funds with maturities of less than 91 days from the date of purchase, and time deposits with maturities of less than 91 days.
(c)   if needed for our u.s. operations, most of the cash and cash equivalents held by the company's foreign subsidiaries could be repatriated, however, under current law, would be subject to u.s. federal and state income taxes. we have not provided for any such tax because the company currently does not anticipate a need to repatriate these funds to finance our u.s. operations and it is the company's intent to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the u.s.
(d)   marketable securities consist of commercial paper rated a1/p1, treasury discount notes, short-to-medium-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers and an equity security (which was sold in the second quarter of 2016). the company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed. the company also invests in equity securities as part of its investment strategy.
(e)   at december 31, 2016 and 2015, cash and cash equivalents includes match group's domestic and international cash and cash equivalents of $114.0 million and $139.6 million; and $34.4 million and $53.8 million, respectively. marketable securities at december 31, 2015 include $11.6 million at match group. there are no marketable securities at december 31, 2016 at match group. match group is a separate and distinct legal entity with its own public shareholders and board of directors and has no obligation to provide the company with funds. as a result, we cannot freely access the cash of match group and its subsidiaries. match group generated $234.1 million and $209.1 million of operating cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. in addition, agreements governing match group's indebtedness limit the payment of dividends or distributions, loans or advances to stockholders, including the company, in the event a default has occurred or match group's leverage ratio (as defined in the indentures) exceeds 5.0 to 1.0.
47
(f)   proceeds from the 2016 match group senior notes were used to prepay a portion of the match group term loan. a final payment of $350 million is due at maturity.
(g)   the match group term loan matures on november 16, 2022; provided that, if any of the 2015 match group senior notes remain outstanding on the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2015 match group senior notes, the match group term loan maturity date shall be the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2015 match group senior notes.
match group senior notes:
on june 1, 2016, match group issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of the 2016 match group senior notes due june 1, 2024.
promptly following the closing of the match exchange offer on november 16, 2015, match group and its subsidiaries were designated as unrestricted subsidiaries of iac for purposes of the indentures governing the 2013 and 2012 senior notes and the iac credit facility. following the designation, neither match group nor any of its subsidiaries guarantee any debt of iac, or are subject to any of the covenants related to such debt.
the indentures governing the 2016 and 2015 match group senior notes contain covenants that would limit match group's ability to pay dividends or to make distributions and repurchase or redeem match group stock in the event a default has occurred or match group's leverage ratio (as defined in the indentures) exceeds 5.0 to 1.0. as of december 31, 2016, match group was in compliance with all applicable covenants and was below the 5.0 to 1.0 leverage ratio.
match group term loan and match group credit facility:
on november 16, 2015, under a credit agreement (the "match group credit agreement"), match group borrowed $800 million in the form of a term loan. on march 31, 2016, the company made a $10.0 million principal payment on the term loan. on june 1, 2016, the proceeds of the 2016 match group senior notes were used to prepay a portion of the match group term loan and, as a result, quarterly principal payments of $10 million under the match group term loan are no longer due. on december 8, 2016, match group made an additional $40 million principal payment on the match group term loan. in addition, the remaining outstanding balance of $350 million, which is due at maturity, was repriced; following the repricing, match group term loan bears interest, at match group's option, at a base rate or libor, plus 2.25% or 3.25%, respectively, and in the case of libor, a floor of 0.75%. the interest rate at december 31, 2016 is 4.20%. interest payments are due at least semi-annually through the term of the loan. the match group term loan provides for additional annual principal payments as part of an excess cash flow sweep provision, the amount of which, if any, is governed by the secured net leverage ratio set forth in the match group credit agreement.
match group has a $500 million revolving credit facility that expires on october 7, 2020 (the "match group credit facility"). the annual commitment fee on undrawn funds based on the current leverage ratio is 30 basis points. borrowings under the match group credit facility bear interest, at match group's option, at a base rate or libor, in each case plus an applicable margin, which is determined by reference to a pricing grid based on match group's consolidated net leverage ratio. the terms of the match group credit facility require match group to maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio of not more than 5.0 to 1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.5 to 1.0 (in each case as defined in the match group credit agreement).
there are additional covenants under the match group credit facility and the match group term loan that limit the ability of match group and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions. while the match group term loan remains outstanding, these same covenants under the match group credit agreement are more restrictive than the covenants that are applicable to the match group credit facility. obligations under the match group credit facility and match group term loan are unconditionally guaranteed by certain match group wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, and are also secured by the stock of certain match group domestic and foreign subsidiaries. the match group term loan and outstanding borrowings, if any, under the match group credit facility rank equally with each other, and have priority over the 2016 and 2015 match group senior notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing the borrowings under the match group credit agreement.
iac senior notes:
the indenture governing the 2013 senior notes contains covenants that would limit our ability to pay dividends or to make distributions and repurchase or redeem our stock in the event a default has occurred or our leverage ratio (as defined in the indenture) exceeds 3.0 to 1.0. at december 31, 2016, there were no limitations pursuant thereto. there are additional covenants that limit the company's ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, (i) incur
48
indebtedness, make investments, or sell assets in the event we are not in compliance with the financial ratio set forth in the indenture, and (ii) incur liens, enter into agreements limiting our restricted subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets. the indenture governing the 2012 senior notes was amended to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants contained therein in connection with the match exchange offer.
iac credit facility:
iac has a $300 million revolving credit facility that expires october 7, 2020 (the "iac credit facility"). the annual commitment fee on undrawn funds is currently 35 basis points and is based on the leverage ratio most recently reported. borrowings under the iac credit facility bear interest, at the company's option, at a base rate or libor, in each case, plus an applicable margin, which is determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the company's leverage ratio. the terms of the iac credit facility require that the company maintains a leverage ratio (as defined in the agreement) of not more than 3.25 to 1.0 and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. borrowings under the iac credit facility are unconditionally guaranteed by the same domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the 2013 and 2012 senior notes and are also secured by the stock of certain of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries. the 2013 and 2012 senior notes rank equally with each other, and are subordinate to outstanding borrowings under the iac credit facility to extent of the value of the assets securing such borrowings.

adjustments to earnings from continuing operations primarily consist of $140.0 million of amortization of intangibles, $105.5 million of stock-based compensation, $62.2 million of depreciation and $14.1 million of goodwill impairment, partially offset by $59.8 million of deferred income taxes, $56.4 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based awards, $34.3 million of gain on a real estate transaction and $15.5 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments. the deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. the increase from changes in working capital consist primarily of an increase in deferred revenue of $66.9 million and an increase in income taxes payable of $24.2 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $29.7 million and an increase in other assets of $21.2 million. the increase in deferred revenue was due mainly to growth in prepaid revenue at match group, vimeo and homeadvisor, increases related to acquisitions, and increases at electus, collegehumor and notional mainly due to the timing of various production deals. the increase in income taxes payable was due to 2015 income tax accruals in excess of 2015 income tax payments. the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to growth in match group's in-app purchases sold through their mobile products and revenue growth at homeadvisor. the increase in other assets was primarily due to match group, relating to an increase in prepaid expenses, primarily from growth and the signing of longer-term contracts, as well as an increase in vat refund receivables in the publishing segment.
net cash used in investing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2015 includes the purchase of acquisitions and investments of $651.9 million, which includes plentyoffish, and capital expenditures of $62.0 million, primarily related to the internal development of software to support our products and services, and computer hardware, partially offset by purchases (net of sales and maturities) of marketable securities of $125.3 million, and net proceeds from the sale of long-term investments and an asset of $9.4 million.
net cash provided by financing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2015 includes $788.0 million in borrowings from the match group term loan, $428.8 million in net proceeds received from match group's initial public offering and excess tax benefits from stock-based awards of $56.4 million, partially offset by $200.0 million used for the repurchase of 3.0 million shares of common stock at an average price of $67.68 per share, $113.2 million related to the payment of cash dividends to iac shareholders, $80.0 million for the early redemption of the liberty bonds, $38.4 million in proceeds related to the issuance of common stock, net of withholding taxes, $32.2 million for the purchase of noncontrolling interests, $23.4 million for the repurchase of stock-based awards and $19.1 million of debt issuance costs primarily associated with the match group term loan and revolving credit facility.
2014
adjustments to earnings from continuing operations primarily consist of $76.9 million of deferred income taxes, $66.6 million of impairments related to long-term investments, $61.2 million of depreciation, $59.6 million of stock-based compensation expense and $57.9 million of amortization of intangibles, partially offset by $45.0 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based awards, a $21.9 million adjustment related to gains on sales of a business and long-term investments and $13.4 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments. the deferred income tax provision primarily relates to a net reduction in deferred tax assets related to the expiration of statutes of limitations for federal income taxes for the years 2001 through 2009. the changes from working capital activities consist of a decrease in income taxes payable of $94.5 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $19.9 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $30.1 million. the decrease in income taxes payable is primarily due to a net reduction in tax reserves related to the expiration of statutes of limitations for federal income taxes for the years 2001 through 2009, partially offset by 2014 income tax accruals in excess of 2014 income tax payments. the increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to revenue growth at homeadvisor. the increase in deferred revenue is due to increases related to acquisitions and growth in membership and subscription revenue at match group and vimeo, respectively.
net cash used in investing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2014 includes acquisitions and investments of $283.7 million, which include the valueclick o&o website businesses, the princeton review, slimware and lovescout24, purchases (net of sales and maturities) of marketable securities of $154.2 million, and capital expenditures of $57.2 million
50
primarily related to the internal development of software to support our products and services, partially offset by $58.4 million of proceeds from the sales of a business and long-term investments.
net cash used in financing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2014 includes $97.3 million related to the payment of cash dividends to iac shareholders, $33.2 million for the purchase of noncontrolling interests in tinder and meetic, and $8.1 million in contingent consideration payments related principally to the 2013 twoo acquisition, partially offset by excess tax benefits from stock-based awards of $45.0 million.
liquidity and capital resources the company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as cash flows generated from operations. iac has a $300 million revolving credit facility that expires on october 7, 2020. match group has a $500 million revolving credit facility that expires on october 7, 2020. at december 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the iac credit facility or the match group credit facility.
at december 31, 2016, iac had 9.3 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization. iac may purchase shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors iac management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook.
iac's consolidated cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2016 were $1.3 billion, of which $253.7 million was held by match group. the company generated $292.4 million of operating cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2016, of which $234.1 million was generated by match group. match group is a separate and distinct legal entity with its own public shareholders and board of directors and has no obligation to provide the company with funds. as a result, we cannot freely access the cash of the match group and its subsidiaries. in addition, agreements governing match group's indebtedness limit the payment of dividends or distributions and loans or advances to stockholders, including the company, in the event a default has occurred or match group's leverage ratio (as defined in the indentures) exceeds 5.0 to 1.0.
the company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations. the company's 2017 capital expenditures are expected to be higher than 2016 by approximately 5% to 10%, driven, in part, by certain corporate related expenditures and homeadvisor's sales center and corporate headquarters expansion.
awards made under our subsidiary denominated equity plans are settled on a net basis, with the award holder entitled to receive a payment in iac shares equal to the intrinsic value of the award at exercise less an amount equal to the required cash tax withholding payment. awards made to employees of match group subsidiaries may be settled in either iac shares or match group shares, at our option. the tax withholding payment associated with these awards is made by the company in cash on behalf of the employee at the time these awards are exercised; in the case of match group awards, the tax withholding payment is made by match group in cash at the time these awards are exercised. in either case, the cash tax withholding payments will vary based on the ultimate number of awards exercised, the intrinsic value of the awards upon exercise and relevant withholding tax rates. we expect a reduction in future corporate income taxes equal to a substantial portion of any such withholding tax payments by virtue of the income tax deduction we will recognize based on the intrinsic value of the awards at exercise. however, there may be some delay in the timing of the realization of the cash benefit of the income tax deduction because it will be dependent upon the amount and timing of future taxable income and the timing of estimated income tax payments. as it relates to awards made to employees of match group subsidiaries, if the company elects to settle these awards in iac shares, we will receive match group shares equal in value to the iac shares issued.  if the company elects to settle these awards in match group shares, our ownership interest in match group will be diluted. the match group subsidiary denominated equity plan at tinder has a number of scheduled option exercise periods, and the next period is in may 2017; the company expects to settle a sufficient number of exercises in iac shares to maintain an economic interest in match group of at least 80%. see "note 13-stock-based compensation" to the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8-consolidated financial statements and supplementary data" for additional discussion of subsidiary denominated equity plans.
the company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and expected positive cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, the payment of withholding taxes on behalf of employees for net-settled stock-based awards, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future. the company's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services. the company's indebtedness could limit our ability to: (i) obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditure or debt service or other requirements; and (ii) use operating cash flow to make acquisitions, capital expenditures, invest in other areas, such as developing properties and exploiting business opportunities, in
51
the event a default has occurred or in certain circumstances our leverage ratio (as defined in the indenture) exceeds 3.0 to 1.0. the company may make additional acquisitions and investments and, as a result, the company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater financial flexibility. additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us.

critical accounting policies and estimates the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of iac's accounting policies contained in "note 2-summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8-consolidated financial statements and supplementary data" in regard to significant areas of judgment. management of the company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. these estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. actual results could differ from these estimates. because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others. what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
business combinations and contingent consideration arrangements acquisitions are an important part of the company's growth strategy. the company invested $18.4 million, $617.4 million and $259.4 million in acquisitions in the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. the fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. the excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.
in connection with certain business combinations, the company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price. each of these arrangements are recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled. the contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics. the company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probability-weighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements. determining the fair value of these arrangements is inherently difficult and subjective. significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. the changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period, including the accretion of the discount, if applicable, are recognized in "general and administrative expense" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. see "note 8-fair value measurements and financial instruments" to the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8-consolidated financial statements and supplementary data" for a discussion of contingent consideration arrangements.
recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill is the company's largest asset with a carrying value of $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the company's acquired trade names and trademarks, have a carrying value of $320.6 million and $380.1 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of october 1 or, more frequently, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. in performing its annual assessment, the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
for the company's annual goodwill test at october 1, 2016, a qualitative assessment of the match group, homeadvisor domestic, homeadvisor international, vimeo, daily burn and shoebuy reporting units' goodwill was performed because the company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values. the primary factors that the company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these reporting units is described below:
•   match group's october 1, 2016 market capitalization of $4.8 billion exceeded its carrying value by more than 970% and match group's strong operating performance.
•   the company performed valuations of the homeadvisor domestic, homeadvisor international, vimeo and daily burn reporting units during 2016. these valuations were prepared primarily in connection with the issuance and/or settlement of equity grants that are denominated in the shares of these businesses. the valuations were prepared time proximate to, however, not as of october 1, 2016. the fair value of each of these businesses was significantly in excess of its october 1, 2016 carrying value.
54
•   shoebuy's expected sales price was significantly in excess of its october 1, 2016 carrying value; which was confirmed by the sales price realized in its sale on december 30, 2016, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $37.5 million.
when the company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value goodwill must be tested for impairment. for the company's annual goodwill test at october 1, 2016, the company concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of the applications and connected ventures reporting units were greater than their respective carrying values and performed a quantitative test of these reporting units. the company's quantitative test indicated that the fair value of each of these reporting units is in excess of its respective carrying value; therefore, the goodwill of these reporting units is not impaired. the publishing reporting unit had no goodwill as of october 1, 2016 because the company recorded an impairment charge equal to the entire $275.4 million balance of the publishing reporting unit goodwill during the second quarter of 2016, which is more fully described below, following a quantitative impairment test as of june 30, 2016. the quantitative impairment test is performed using the two-step process described below.
the first step of an annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the company's reporting units to its carrying value, including goodwill. the fair value of the company's reporting units is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows ("dcf") and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of october 1 each year. the company uses the same approach in determining the fair value of its businesses in connection with its subsidiary denominated stock based compensation plans, which can be a significant factor in the decision to apply the qualitative screen. determining fair value using a dcf analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. the expected cash flows used in the dcf analyses are based on the company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. assumptions used in the dcf analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed based on the reporting units' current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. the discount rates used in determining the fair value of the company's reporting units ranged from 10% to 17.5% in 2016 and 12% to 22% in 2015. determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. from the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. to determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors. while a primary driver in the determination of the fair values of the company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability, the determination of fair value is based, in part, upon the company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed. the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment, if any. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. in other words, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid. if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. the company has adopted the provisions of accounting standards update no. 2017-04, intangibles-goodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the test for goodwill impairment, effective january 1, 2017. therefore, any goodwill impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based solely upon the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value. the second step of the impairment analysis that is described above will no longer be performed.
at october 1, 2016, the fair value of each of the company's reporting units with goodwill exceeded its carrying value by more than 20%.
while the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible asset are less than its carrying value, the company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of october 1. the company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis. significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the company's trade names and trademarks. assumptions used in the avoided royalty
55
dcf analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. the discount rates used in the company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 11% to 16% in both 2016 and 2015, and the royalty rates used ranged from 2% to 7% in 2016 and 1% to 9% in 2015.
while the 2016 annual assessment did not identify any material impairments, during the second quarter of 2016, the company recorded impairment charges equal to the entire $275.4 million balance of the publishing reporting unit goodwill and $11.6 million related to certain publishing indefinite-lived intangible assets. the 2015 annual assessment identified impairment charges related to certain intangible assets of the publishing reporting unit and the goodwill on the shoebuy reporting unit of $88.0 million and $14.1 million, respectively. these impairment charges are more fully described above in "results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014-operating income (loss)" and "note 2-summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8-consolidated financial statements and supplementary data."
recoverability and estimated useful lives of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. in addition, the company reviews the useful lives of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these lives may be changed. the carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $341.1 million and $363.5 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the balance of deferred tax liabilities, net, is $226.3 million and $346.8 million, respectively.
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, the company has unrecognized tax benefits of $41.0 million and $43.4 million, including interest, respectively. changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material. differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the company are recorded in the period they become known.
the ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the company that vary significantly from anticipated results.
no income taxes have been provided on indefinitely reinvested earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregating $680.2 million at december 31, 2016. the estimated amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to such earnings would be $169.3 million.
stock-based compensation the company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $104.8 million, $105.4 million and $59.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the company estimated the fair value of stock options issued in 2016, 2015 and 2014 using a black-scholes option pricing model and, for those with a market condition, a lattice model. for stock options, including subsidiary denominated equity, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date at fair value and expensed over the vesting term. the impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended december 31, 2016, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor and a one-year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $3.5 million, $15.9 million and
56
$7.1 million, respectively. the company also issues rsus and performance-based rsus. for rsus issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying iac common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term. for performance-based rsus issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying iac common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
marketable securities and long-term investments at december 31, 2016, marketable securities of $89.3 million consist of commercial paper rated a1/p1, treasury discount notes and short-to-medium-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers. long-term investments at december 31, 2016 of $122.8 million include equity securities accounted for under the cost and equity methods.
the company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed. marketable securities are adjusted to fair value each quarter, and the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders' equity. the specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings. the company recognizes unrealized losses on marketable securities in net earnings when the losses are determined to be other-than-temporary. additionally, the company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis, and recognizes an impairment loss if the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary. future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as other-than-temporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the company's investments to decline.
the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments. investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition, the rate at which the investee utilizes cash and the investee's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee's existing business model due to changing business and regulatory environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations. during 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company recognized other-than-temporary impairments of $10.0 million, $6.7 million and $66.6 million, respectively, related to cost method investments. these charges are described above in "results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014-other income (expense), net."

item 1a. risk factors the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. the information set forth in this item 1a. risk factors should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this annual report, including item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data."
significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial, operating and environmental matters could affect us, our customers, and the markets we serve. congress can enact laws that could increase economic regulation of the industry. railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the stb, which has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates, routes, customer access provisions, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines. the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers. additional economic regulation of the rail industry by congress or the stb, whether under new or existing laws, could have a significant negative impact on our ability to determine prices for rail services and on the efficiency of our operations. this potential material adverse effect could also result in reduced capital spending on our rail network or abandonment of lines.
k 11
railroads are also subject to the enactment of laws by congress and regulation by the dot and the dhs (which regulate most aspects of our operations) related to safety and security. the rail safety improvement act of 2008 (rsia), the surface transportation extension act of 2015, and the implementing regulations promulgated by the fra require us and each other class i railroad to implement an interoperable positive train control system (ptc) on certain of our respective lines by december 31, 2018.
full implementation of ptc in compliance with rsia will result in additional operating costs and capital expenditures, and ptc implementation may result in reduced operational efficiency and service levels, as well as increased compensation and benefits expenses, and increased claims and litigation costs.
our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases. the risk of incurring environmental liability, for acts and omissions, past, present, and future, is inherent in the railroad business. this risk includes property owned by us, whether currently or in the past, that is or has been subject to a variety of uses, including our railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or our past and present tenants.
environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, and we could incur environmental liabilities or costs, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time, with respect to one or more of these properties. moreover, lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time.
concern over climate change has led to significant federal, state, and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions. restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on ghg emissions, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs, decrease the amount of traffic handled, and decrease the value of coal reserves we own.
in addition, legislation and regulation could negatively affect the markets we serve and our customers, including those related to ghgs. even without legislation or regulation, government incentives and adverse publicity relating to ghgs could negatively affect the markets for certain of the commodities we carry and our customers that (1) use commodities that we carry to produce energy, including coal, (2) use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or (3) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy.
as a common carrier by rail, we must offer to transport hazardous materials, regardless of risk. transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and property (including environmental) damage, and compromise critical parts of our rail network. the cost of a catastrophic rail accident involving hazardous materials could exceed our insurance coverage. we have obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements); however, insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us.
we may be affected by general economic conditions. prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions could affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry. economic conditions could also result in bankruptcies of one or more large customers.
significant increases in demand for rail services could result in the unavailability of qualified personnel and locomotives. in addition, workforce demographics and training requirements, particularly for engineers and conductors, could have a negative impact on our ability to meet demand for rail service. unpredicted increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks.
k 12
we may be affected by energy prices. volatility in energy prices could have a significant effect on a variety of items including, but not limited to: the economy; demand for transportation services; business related to the energy sector, including crude oil, natural gas, and coal; fuel prices; and fuel surcharges.
we face competition from other transportation providers. we are subject to competition from motor carriers, railroads and, to a lesser extent, ships, barges, and pipelines, on the basis of transit time, pricing, and quality and reliability of service. while we have used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain our rail system, trucks and barges have been able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. any future improvements, expenditures, legislation, or regulation materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate (such as granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations or adoption of autonomous commercial vehicles) could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
the operations of carriers with which we interchange may adversely affect our operations. our ability to provide rail service to customers in the u.s. and canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain collaborative relationships with connecting carriers (including shortlines and regional railroads) with respect to, among other matters, freight rates, revenue division, car supply and locomotive availability, data exchange and communications, reciprocal switching, interchange, and trackage rights. deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers, or in our relationship with those connecting carriers, could result in our inability to meet our customers' demands or require us to use alternate train routes, which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies. additionally, any significant consolidations, mergers or operational changes among other railroads may significantly redefine our market access and reach.
we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations. if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems, including computer hardware, software, and communications equipment, we could experience a service interruption, a security breach, or other operational difficulties. accordingly, we also face cybersecurity threats which may result in breaches of systems, or compromises of sensitive data, which may result in an inability to access or operate systems necessary for conducting operations and providing customer service, thereby impacting our efficiency and/or damaging our corporate reputation. additionally, if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or we are unable to implement new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service.
the vast majority of our employees belong to labor unions, and labor agreements, strikes, or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations. approximately 80% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. if unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations. additionally, future national labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could significantly increase our costs for healthcare, wages, and other benefits.
we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, commercial disputes, freight loss and other property damage, and other matters. job-related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employer's liability act (fela), which is applicable only to railroads. fela's fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker's compensation system. the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded.
any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent not covered by insurance. we have obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements); however, insurance is available k 13
from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us.
severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures. severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including hurricanes, floods, fires, and earthquakes, may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues.
we may be affected by terrorism or war. any terrorist attack, or other similar event, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption. because we play a critical role in the nation's transportation system, we could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government's preemptive approach or response to an attack or war.
although we currently maintain insurance coverage for third-party liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism, we maintain only limited insurance coverage for first-party property damage and damage to property in our care, custody, or control caused by certain acts of terrorism. in addition, premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically, or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to us in the future.
we may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of our supplier markets. we consumed approximately 462 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2016. fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations. a severe fuel supply shortage arising from production curtailments, increased demand in existing or emerging foreign markets, disruption of oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or other factors could impact us as well as our customers and other transportation companies.
due to the capital intensive nature, as well as the industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, high barriers of entry exist for potential new suppliers of core railroad items, such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment. additionally, we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of locomotives and certain track and rolling stock materials. changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited supplier markets could result in increased prices or significant shortages of materials.
the state of capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity. from time-to-time we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements, including the issuance of long-term debt instruments and commercial paper, as well as the sale of certain receivables. significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including the credit markets, or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate our access to, and/or significantly increase the cost of, various financing sources, including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds. instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of our financial condition, alone or in combination, could also result in a reduction in our credit rating to below investment grade, which could prohibit or restrict us from accessing external sources of short- and long-term debt financing and/or significantly increase the associated costs.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes.
overview we are one of the nation's premier transportation companies.  our norfolk southern railway company subsidiary operates approximately 19,500 miles of road in 22 states and the district of columbia, serves every major container port in the eastern united states, and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers.  we operate the most extensive intermodal network in the east and are a major transporter of coal, automotive and industrial products.
our 2016 results reflect our progress and commitment to achieving the goals set forth in our strategic plan. through a disciplined cost-control focus, we achieved a record-setting railway operating ratio (a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses) of 68.9% and delivered approximately $250 million of productivity savings, despite the economic challenges that continue to affect our industry. operational improvements allowed us to maintain near all-time best service levels and achieve high levels of network fluidity, which improved train performance and asset utilization. in addition to these improvements, the implementation of multiple cost-control initiatives drove savings in operating expenses across all categories.
in 2017, we expect to maintain high levels of service and see continued improvement in our operating ratio. railway operating revenues are expected to increase, driven by volume growth in our coal and intermodal markets, in addition to higher average revenue per unit, a result of pricing gains and fuel surcharge revenue increases largely driven by higher expected fuel prices. railway operating expenses are expected to increase next year, driven in large part by medical and wage inflation as well as volume-related expenses, offset in part by the continuation of targeted expense reductions as we balance resources with the demand for our high-quality rail service. we continue to focus on executing our strategic plan and remain committed to maintaining our strong levels of rail service, generating higher returns on capital, and increasing the efficiency of our resources.

the increase in net income for 2016, compared to 2015, was driven by higher income from railway operations, as railway operating expense decreases (down $813 million, or 11%) more than offset declines in railway operating revenues (down $623 million, or 6%). the decrease in net income for 2015, compared to 2014, reflected lower income from railway operations, driven by a sharp decline in railway operating revenues (down $1.1 billion, or 10%) offset in part by lower railway operating expenses (down $422 million, or 5%). the 2015 results include $93 million of costs associated with the restructuring of our triple crown services (tcs) subsidiary and the closure of our roanoke, virginia corporate office, which reduced net income by $58 million, or $0.19 per diluted share.

revenues decreased $623 million in 2016 and $1.1 billion in 2015.  as reflected in the table below, both declines resulted from lower average revenue per unit and reduced volume. in 2016, the effects of reduced fuel surcharges and changes in traffic mix more than offset price increases. volume decreases were primarily driven by reductions in energy-related markets and the restructuring of our tcs subsidiary. for 2015, a large drop in fuel surcharge revenues more than offset pricing gains to drive average revenue per unit lower. the volume decline was driven by continued weakness in the coal markets.

most of our contracts include negotiated fuel surcharges, typically tied to either west texas intermediate crude oil (wti) or on-highway diesel (ohd). approximately 90% of our revenue base is covered by these negotiated fuel surcharges, with more than half tied to ohd. for 2016, contracts tied to ohd accounted for about 90% of our fuel surcharge revenue, as price levels were below most of our surcharge trigger points in contracts tied to wti. revenues associated with fuel surcharges totaled $236 million, $477 million, and $1,329 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
merchandise revenues decreased for both 2016 and 2015, compared with the years before. in 2016, the effects of lower volume were offset in part by a slight increase in average revenue per unit. price increases were tempered by reduced fuel surcharge revenues (which lowered average revenue per unit by $31) and unfavorable changes in traffic mix. the 2015 decline reflected lower average revenue per unit, the result of lower fuel surcharge revenues (which reduced average revenue per unit by $185) that offset the effects of higher rates. volume was relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014.
for 2017, merchandise revenues are expected to increase, primarily the result of pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenues.
chemicals revenues were lower year-over-year in 2016 and 2015. the 2016 decline was due to lower traffic volume, reflecting fewer shipments of crude oil originated from the bakken oil fields, in addition to lower chlor-alkali and rock salt traffic, the result of market consolidations and softened demand. these declines were offset in part by higher average revenue per unit due to favorable mix, as increased volumes of higher-rated plastics more than offset reduced fuel surcharge revenues.
in 2015, the decline was the result of lower average revenue per unit, driven by reduced fuel surcharge revenues and negative mix resulting from increased shipments of lower-rated liquefied petroleum gas, which more than offset the effect of higher rates. volumes increased for the year, largely driven by liquefied petroleum gas volume gains as well as strong demand for shipments of polypropylene due to lower feedstock prices. these volume increases were partially offset by fewer shipments of crude oil from the bakken oil fields.
for 2017, chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase, as average revenue per unit is expected to be higher, largely the effect of favorable mix, driven by increased volumes of higher-rated plastics, and pricing gains. however, we expect these gains to be mitigated by lower shipments of crude oil from the bakken oil fields and liquefied petroleum gas in the utica shale region.

one of our chemical customers, sunbelt chlor alkali partnership (sunbelt), filed a rate reasonableness complaint before the stb alleging that our tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable. since april 1, 2011, we have been billing and collecting amounts based on the challenged tariff rates. in 2014, the stb resolved this rate reasonableness complaint in our favor. in june 2016, the stb resolved petitions for reconsideration.  the matter remains decided in our favor; however, the findings are still subject to appeal. we believe the estimate of any reasonably possible loss will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. with regard to rate cases, we record adjustments to revenues in the periods if and when such adjustments are probable and reasonably estimable.
agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues increased for both years, compared with the years before. the improvement in 2016 was driven by higher average revenue per unit primarily the result of pricing gains, offset in part by lower fuel surcharge revenues. volumes decreased for the year driven by weaker demand for feed shipments and the effects of customer sourcing changes on corn volumes, offset in part by an increase in soybean export shipments and higher food oil volumes driven by service improvements.
the increase in 2015 was the result of more ethanol shipments due to higher gasoline consumption, offset in part by lower fuel surcharge revenues and fewer revenue shipments of empty rail cars as part of the conclusion of a hopper re-body program.
for 2017, agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues are expected to increase, driven by more shipments of corn and feed products, and by increased average revenue per unit, primarily a result of pricing gains.
metals and construction revenues were up slightly in 2016 after falling in 2015, compared with the prior years. the increase in 2016 was driven by higher demand for aggregates and iron and steel shipments, and more coil steel traffic due to customer sourcing changes. these increases were offset in part by lower demand for materials used in natural gas and oil drilling as a result of depressed commodity prices. average revenue per unit declined for the year, driven by lower fuel surcharge revenues and changes in traffic mix.
in 2015, the decline was driven by a drop in average revenue per unit, largely the result of lower fuel surcharge revenues partially offset by pricing gains, and a decrease in carloads. the volume decline was the result of lower demand for materials used in the construction of pipe for drilling activity, fewer shipments of fractionating sand and ceramic proppant used in natural gas drilling, and declines in scrap metal and coil shipments, resulting from declines in steel production due to global over-supply. these decreases were offset in part by increased shipments of aggregates as a result of higher demand in the southeast for project work and strong highway and construction related markets.
for 2017, metals and construction revenues are expected to increase, as average revenue per unit is expected to be higher, primarily due to changes in the mix of traffic. we also expect volumes to increase next year, driven by growth in steel related products, in addition to higher cement shipments driven by increased construction activity.
automotive revenues rose in 2016 after falling in 2015, compared with the prior years. for 2016, volumes increased as a result of higher automotive parts shipments and growth in the production of north american light vehicles. average revenue per unit declined for the year, driven by lower fuel surcharge revenues offset in part by pricing gains.
the decline in 2015 reflected a drop in average revenue per unit primarily due to lower fuel surcharge revenues, offset in part by pricing gains. volumes increased for the year, driven by gains in production of north american light vehicles.
for 2017, automotive revenues are expected to decrease as a result of volume declines related to extended retooling at several ns-served assembly plants and expected decreases in u.s. vehicle production, offset in part by higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenues.
k 22
paper, clay and forest products revenues were down in both 2016 and 2015, compared to the prior years. the decline in 2016 reflected volume decreases in our pulpboard and woodchip markets due to customer sourcing changes, in addition to lower paper shipments as a result of decreased demand and further contraction of the paper market. average revenue per unit increased for the year driven by pricing gains, offset in part by lower fuel surcharge revenues.
in 2015, both average revenue per unit and volumes decreased. the decline in average revenue per unit was driven primarily by lower fuel surcharge revenues and negative mix (fewer higher-rated kaolin shipments) offset by pricing gains. volume changes reflected lower waste, kaolin, woodchip, and graphic paper volumes as a result of customer sourcing changes, softened demand, and mill closures, offset by higher carloads of pulpboard, lumber, and pulp due to continued recovery of the housing market.
for 2017, paper, clay, and forest products revenues are anticipated to increase, as we expect average revenue per unit to be higher, largely due to pricing gains. additionally, we expect volume to increase next year, driven by growth in our miscellaneous waste and lumber markets as a result of higher construction activity, and increased pulp volumes driven by growth in consumer demand. these volume increases will be partially offset by lower pulpboard shipments due to customer sourcing changes, weaker export demand for kaolin shipments, and further contraction of the paper market.
intermodal revenues decreased in both years, a result of lower average revenue per unit that more than offset small volume increases. in 2016, reduced fuel surcharge revenues and the effects of the tcs subsidiary restructuring (which together lowered average revenue per unit $57) offset the effects of price increases. volume was up slightly for the year as growth in our domestic and international business offset the losses from the restructuring of our tcs subsidiary. in 2015, lower average revenue per unit was the result of lower fuel surcharges (which decreased average revenue per unit by $51). volume gains in international shipments were almost fully offset by declines in domestic shipments.
for 2017, we expect higher intermodal revenues due to increased volumes and average revenue per unit, primarily driven by higher fuel surcharge revenues and pricing gains.
intermodal units by market were as follows:

k 23
total domestic volume decreased in both years, driven by the restructuring of our tcs subsidiary. in 2016, domestic volumes excluding tcs increased due to growth from new and existing accounts that exceeded the negative effects of increased trucking capacity. in 2015, volumes were also affected by ongoing service challenges during the first three quarters of the year, an increase in available trucking capacity, and weaker overall demand, all partially offset by growth from continued highway conversions.
for 2017, we expect higher domestic volumes driven from continued highway conversions and growth associated with new and existing customers.
international volume increased in both years reflecting increased demand from existing customers and market share gains.
for 2017, we expect continued growth in our international volume largely driven by more traffic from both new and existing customers.
coal revenues decreased in each of 2016 and 2015, compared with the prior years. both declines reflected lower carload volumes and decreased average revenue per unit, primarily due to reduced fuel surcharge revenues, which lowered average revenue per unit by $34 in 2016 and $134 in 2015.
for 2017, coal revenues are expected to increase driven largely by higher utility and export volumes, in addition to an improved average revenue per unit, primarily the result of pricing gains in our export market and higher fuel surcharges.
as shown in the following table, tonnage decreased in all markets both years.

utility coal tonnage in 2016 reflected residual stockpile overhang and limited coal burn due to milder weather and sustained lower natural gas prices. for 2015, the decline was driven by reduced coal burn as significantly lower natural gas prices caused utilities to shift away from coal generation. in addition, volumes were adversely affected by coal plant retirements and mild weather during the last half of 2015.
for 2017, we expect utility tonnage to increase driven by higher natural gas prices and weather-related normalization, in addition to market share gains.
export coal tonnage also decreased both years, a result of strong competition faced by u.s. coal suppliers as excess coal supply, weak seaborne coal prices, and a strong u.s. dollar reduced demand for export coal. volume through norfolk was down 1.7 million tons, or 15%, in 2016, following a drop of 5.5 million tons, or 33%, in 2015. volume through baltimore was up slightly in 2016 but was down 1.5 million tons, or 23%, in 2015.
for 2017, we expect export coal tonnage to increase, as higher prices from a tightening of the international coal supply, a continued trend from the last quarter of 2016, is expected to drive incremental production increases.
k 24
domestic metallurgical coal tonnage was down in both years, compared with the prior periods. the 2016 decline was largely driven by softness in the metallurgical market, offset in part by customer-specific gains. the 2015 decrease reflected volume losses related to plant curtailments and sourcing shifts resulting from steel producers looking for opportunities to reduce costs that were offset in part by market share gains.
for 2017, domestic metallurgical coal tonnage is expected to remain relatively flat as customer-specific gains will offset losses from sourcing shifts and supply issues driven by increased demand in export markets.
industrial coal tonnage dropped in both years, compared with the prior periods. both years reflected volume losses related to natural gas conversions and decreased coal burn, both of which accelerated in 2016. in addition, 2016 volumes were further affected by a partial plant closure that took place in the first half of the year.
for 2017, industrial coal tonnage is expected to decrease driven by continued pressure from natural gas conversions and customer sourcing changes.

in 2016, we experienced decreases across all categories driven largely from cost-control initiatives, lower fuel expense, the absence of restructuring costs incurred in 2015, and service improvements. in 2015, decreases in fuel costs and incentive compensation were offset in part by costs associated with the tcs restructuring and closure of our roanoke, virginia corporate office, in addition to higher wage rates.
k 25
compensation and benefits decreased in 2016, compared to 2015, reflecting changes in:
•   employee levels, including decreased overtime and trainees (down $184 million),
•   pension costs (down $38 million)
•   payroll taxes (down $27 million),
•   labor agreement payments in 2015 ($24 million),
•   pay rates (up $34 million),
•   health and welfare benefit costs for agreement employees (up $35 million), which reflected higher rates, offset in part by favorability from reduced headcount, and
•   bonus accruals (up $59 million).
in 2015, compensation and benefits increased slightly, a result of changes in:
•   pay rates (up $83 million),
•   payroll taxes (up $37 million),
•   labor agreement payments ($24 million),
•   employee levels, including overtime and increased trainees (up $21 million), and
•   incentive compensation (down $151 million).
our employment averaged 28,044 in 2016, compared with 30,456 in 2015, and 29,482 in 2014. looking forward to 2017, we expect higher compensation and benefit expenses, a result of wage increases, medical cost inflation and higher levels of incentive compensation. we anticipate that cost-control initiatives will keep employment levels flat notwithstanding expected volume increases.
purchased services and rents includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals.

the 2016 decrease in purchased services expense reflected lower tcs operational costs, reduced repair and maintenance expenses, and decreased transportation activity costs, offset in part by higher volume-related costs in intermodal operations. the increase in 2015 reflected higher costs associated with intermodal operations, information technology, maintenance and repair, and the roanoke, virginia corporate office closure, partially offset by tcs restructuring-related savings.
equipment rents, which includes our cost of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment, decreased in 2016 largely from improved network velocity, offset in part by higher rates and conventional intermodal volumes. the 2015 increase was principally due to higher automotive and intermodal rates and volumes.
fuel expense, which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations, decreased in both 2016 and 2015 compared with the prior years. both declines were principally the result of lower locomotive fuel prices (down 18% in 2016 and 40% in 2015). locomotive fuel consumption decreased 5% in 2016 and 1% in 2015. we consumed approximately 462 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2016, compared with 487 million gallons in 2015 and 494 million gallons in 2014.
k 26
depreciation expense decreased in 2016, but increased in 2015, compared to prior years, a result of the effects of the tcs restructuring. in 2015 we recognized $63 million in accelerated depreciation on tcs assets as a result of the restructuring. both periods also reflect growth in our roadway and equipment capital base as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and rolling stock.

in 2016, lower materials and other expenses more than offset higher costs for casualties and other claims. material usage costs declined for the year primarily driven by lower locomotive, roadway and freight car repair costs associated with cost-control initiatives and improved asset utilization.
casualties and other claims expenses include the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage, and environmental matters. the increase in 2016 was primarily driven by higher derailment expenses. the small rise in 2015 reflected less favorable personal injury reserve adjustments for prior years' claim amounts, offset in part by reduced environmental remediation costs as a result of less unfavorable development for our environmental liability.
other expense this year reflected $37 million of gains from the sale of operating land. both year-over-year variances were affected by higher than normal expenses in 2015 relocating employees in connection with the closure of our roanoke, virginia office. the 2015 increase also included higher travel costs for train service employees and higher property taxes.
income taxes the effective income tax rate was 35.4% in 2016, compared with 36.3% in 2015 and 36.2% in 2014. the decrease in 2016 reflects favorable tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation and higher returns from corporate-owned life insurance. all three years benefited from favorable reductions in deferred taxes for state tax law changes and certain business tax credits.

financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources cash provided by operating activities, our principal source of liquidity, was $3.0 billion in 2016 and $2.9 billion in both 2015 and 2014. the increase in 2016 was primarily the result of improved operating results. lower cash from operations in 2015 compared with 2014 was offset by reduced tax payments. we had a working capital deficit of $48 million at december 31, 2016, compared with working capital of $281 million at december 31, 2015. cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were invested in accordance with our corporate investment policy.  the portfolio contains securities that are subject to market risk.  there are no limits or restrictions on our access to these assets.  we expect cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations.

off balance sheet arrangements consist of obligations related to operating leases, which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in note 9.
cash used in investing activities was $1.8 billion in 2016, compared with $2.1 billion in 2015, and $2.0 billion in 2014.  both year-over-year comparisons reflected higher cash outflows for property additions in 2015, including approximately $215 million for the acquisition of the delaware and hudson railway co. line. in addition, 2015 included higher proceeds from corporate-owned life insurance investments.
capital spending and track and equipment statistics can be found within the "railway property" section of part i of this report on form 10-k.
for 2017, we have budgeted $1.9 billion for property additions.  the anticipated spending includes $930 million for the normalized replacement of rail, ties, and ballast, the improvement or replacement of bridges and other maintenance of way items.  planned equipment spending of $340 million includes new and rebuilt locomotives, mill gondolas, automobile multilevel recertifications, and covered hoppers. investments in facilities and terminals are anticipated to be $170 million and include terminals and equipment to add capacity to our intermodal network, expanded bulk transfer facilities, improvements to vehicle distribution facilities, and upgrades and expansions of our mechanical service shops.  for 2017, we have budgeted $240 million for the continued implementation of ptc and expect post-2017 ptc-related property additions to total approximately $300 million.  technology and other k 28
investments of $110 million are planned for new or upgraded systems and computers. we also expect to spend $80 million on infrastructure improvements to increase mainline capacity and to accommodate business growth.
cash used in financing activities was $1.3 billion in 2016, compared with $693 million in 2015, and $1.4 billion in 2014.  the increase in 2016 was driven primarily by higher debt repayments and lower proceeds from borrowing, partially offset by lower share repurchase activity.  the decrease in 2015 was driven primarily by higher proceeds from borrowings and lower debt repayments, partially offset by higher share repurchase activity.
share repurchases totaled $803 million in 2016, $1.1 billion in 2015, and $318 million in 2014 for the purchase and retirement of 9.2 million, 11.3 million, and 3.1 million shares, respectively.  on august 1, 2012, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 50 million shares of common stock through december 31, 2017, and 14.7 million shares remain under this authority as of december 31, 2016.  the timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors.  any near-term purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash, cash on hand, or proceeds from borrowings.
we discuss our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization program in note 8 of our notes to consolidated financial statements, and we have authority from our board of directors to issue an additional $1.2 billion of debt or equity securities through public or private sale, all of which provide for access to additional liquidity should the need arise. our debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 45.1% at december 31, 2016, compared with 45.3% at december 31, 2015.
upcoming annual debt maturities are relatively modest (note 8).  overall, our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles.
application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions.  accordingly, we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment, and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  we regularly discuss the development, selection, and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors.
pensions and other postretirement benefits accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions (note 11).  these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans' assets and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality.  in addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value.  we make these estimates based on our historical experience and other information that we deem pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock market performance).  we utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm's studies to assist us in selecting appropriate actuarial assumptions and valuing related liabilities.
in recording our net pension benefit, we assumed a long-term investment rate of return of 8.25%, which was supported by the long-term total rate of return on plan assets since inception, as well as our expectation of future returns. a one-percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a $21 million change in pension expense. we review assumptions related to our defined benefit plans annually, and while changes are likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings, and mortality, they are not expected to have k 29
a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future. the net pension liability is recorded at net present value using discount rates that are based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments.  we utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds.  we use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans.
properties and depreciation most of our assets are long-lived railway properties (note 6).  as disclosed in note 1, the primary depreciation method for our asset base is group life.  units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors.  remaining properties are depreciated generally using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives. see note 1 for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in this area.
depreciation expense for 2016 totaled $1.0 billion.  our composite depreciation rates for 2016 are disclosed in note 6; a one-tenth percentage point increase (or decrease) in these rates would have resulted in a $39 million increase (or decrease) to depreciation expense.  for 2016, roadway depreciation rates ranged from 0.83% to 14.86% and equipment depreciation rates ranged from 1.38% to 30.18%.
personal injury, environmental, and legal liabilities casualties and other claims expense, included in "materials and other" in the consolidated statements of income, consists primarily of our accrual for personal injury liabilities and environmental remediation costs.
to aid in valuing our personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during each period, we utilize studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm.  the actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences. we adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study. our estimate is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events and as such the ultimate loss sustained may vary from the estimated liability recorded.
we are subject to various jurisdictions' environmental laws and regulations.  we record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably.  environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates. additionally, our environmental policy council (composed of senior managers) oversees and interprets our environmental policy.
we and/or certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations. when we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to earnings.
for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in accounting for personal injury and environmental matters see note 16.
k 30
income taxes our net deferred tax liability totaled $9.1 billion at december 31, 2016 (note 3).  this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements.  after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns.  for state income and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. a valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. we have a $39 million valuation allowance on $628 million of deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2016, reflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized.
other matters labor agreements approximately 80% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.  pursuant to the railway labor act, these agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached, or until the bargaining procedures mandated by the act are completed.  we largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads, represented by the national carriers conference committee (nccc).  moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements.
beginning in late 2014, the nccc and the various unions exchanged new proposals to begin the current round of national negotiations.  the unions have formed three separate bargaining coalitions and negotiations with each are ongoing with the assistance of mediators from the national mediation board.  separately, in january 2015 we reached an agreement covering wages and work rules through 2019 with the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen (blet), which represents approximately 20% of our union workforce.  changes to the blet benefit plan will be bargained nationally through the nccc.
market risks we manage overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed- and floating-rate debt instruments. at december 31, 2016, debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled $200 million. a one-percentage point increase in interest rates would increase total annual interest expense related to all variable debt by approximately $2 million. we consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
new accounting pronouncements for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see note 1.
inflation in preparing financial statements, gaap requires the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property.  as a capital-intensive company, we have most of our capital invested in long-lived assets.  the replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.
forward-looking statements certain statements in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, as amended.  these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of k 31
activity, performance, or our achievements or those of our industry to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.  in some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as "may," "will," "could," "would," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "intend," "believe," "estimate," "project," "consider," "predict," "potential," "feel," or other comparable terminology.  we have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates, beliefs, and projections.  while we believe these expectations, assumptions, estimates, beliefs, and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control.  these and other important factors, including those discussed in part ii, item 1a "risk factors," may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.  the forward-looking statements herein are made only as of the date they were first issued, and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  copies of our press releases and additional information about us is available at www.norfolksouthern.com, or you can contact norfolk southern corporation investor relations department by calling 757-629-2861.

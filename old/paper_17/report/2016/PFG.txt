16. segment information we provide financial products and services through the following segments: retirement and income solutions, principal global investors, principal international and u.s. insurance solutions. in addition, we have a corporate segment. the segments are managed and reported separately because they provide different products and services, have different strategies or have different markets and distribution channels.
during fourth quarter 2016, we decided to move long-term care, a business we exited and fully reinsured in 1997, from the u.s. insurance solutions segment to the corporate segment to align it with the management of other exited businesses in the corporate segment. this change has been applied retrospectively to our segment financial information but did not impact our consolidated financial statements.
the retirement and income solutions segment provides retirement and related financial products and services primarily to businesses, their employees and other individuals.
the principal global investors segment provides asset management services to our asset accumulation business, our insurance operations, the corporate segment and third party clients. this segment also includes our mutual fund business.
the principal international segment has operations in latin america (brazil, chile and mexico) and asia (china, hong kong special administrative region, india and southeast asia). we focus on locations with large middle classes,

favorable demographics and growing long-term savings, ideally with voluntary or mandatory pension markets. we entered these locations through acquisitions, start-up operations and joint ventures.
the u.s. insurance solutions segment provides specialty benefits insurance, which consists of group dental and vision insurance, individual and group disability insurance, group life insurance and non-medical fee-for-service claims administration, and individual life insurance throughout the united states.
our corporate segment manages the assets representing capital that has not been allocated to any other segment.
financial results of the corporate segment primarily reflect our financing activities (including financing costs and preferred stock dividends), income on capital not allocated to other segments, inter-segment eliminations, income tax risks and certain income, expenses and other adjustments not allocated to the segments based on the nature of such items. results of principal securities, inc., our retail broker-dealer and registered investment advisor, and our exited group medical and long-term care insurance businesses are reported in this segment.
management uses segment pre-tax operating earnings in evaluating performance, which is consistent with the financial results provided to and discussed with securities analysts. we determine segment pre-tax operating earnings by adjusting u.s. gaap income before income taxes for pre-tax net realized capital gains (losses), as adjusted, pre-tax other adjustments that management believes are not indicative of overall operating trends and certain adjustments related to equity method investments and noncontrolling interest. pre-tax net realized capital gains (losses), as adjusted, are net of related changes in the amortization pattern of dac and related actuarial balances, recognition of deferred front-end fee revenues for sales charges on retirement and life insurance products and services, amortization of hedge accounting book value adjustments for certain discontinued hedges, net realized capital gains and losses distributed, certain adjustments related to equity method investments, certain adjustments related to sponsored investment funds and certain market value adjustments to fee revenues. pre-tax net realized capital gains (losses), as adjusted, exclude periodic settlements and accruals on derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments and exclude certain market value adjustments of embedded derivatives and realized capital gains (losses) associated with our exited group medical insurance business. segment operating revenues exclude net realized capital gains (losses) (except periodic settlements and accruals on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments), including their impact on recognition of front-end fee revenues, certain market value adjustments to fee revenues, certain adjustments related to equity method investments, certain adjustments related to sponsored investment funds and amortization of hedge accounting book value adjustments for certain discontinued hedges; certain adjustments related to equity method investments, pre-tax other adjustments management believes are not indicative of overall operating trends and revenue from our exited group medical insurance business. while these items may be significant components in understanding and assessing the consolidated financial performance, management believes the presentation of segment pre-tax operating earnings enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting pre-tax earnings attributable to the normal, ongoing operations of the business.
the accounting policies of the segments are consistent with the accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements, with the exception of: (1) pension and other postretirement employee benefit cost allocations and (2)
income tax allocations. for purposes of determining operating earnings, the segments are allocated the service component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs. the corporate segment reflects the non-service components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs as assumptions are established and funding decisions are managed from a company-wide perspective. the corporate segment functions to absorb the risk inherent in interpreting and applying tax law. for purposes of determining operating earnings, the segments are allocated tax adjustments consistent with the positions we took on tax returns. the corporate segment results reflect any differences between the tax returns and the estimated resolution of any disputes.

the fair value of stock options is estimated using the black-scholes option pricing model. the following is a summary of the assumptions used in this model for the stock options granted during the period:
for the year ended december 31, options                                                   2016         2015         2014

weighted average estimated fair value    $                8.91     $  20.43     $  18.89
we determine expected volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using daily price observations and implied volatility from traded options on our common stock. we believe that incorporating both historical and implied volatility into our expected volatility assumption calculation better reflects market expectations. the expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. we determine expected term using historical exercise and employee termination data. the risk-free rate for periods within the expected term of the option is based on the u.s. treasury risk-free interest rate in effect at the time of grant.
the dividend yield is based on historical dividend distributions compared to the closing price of our common shares on the grant date.
as of december 31, 2016, we had $2.9 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock options. the cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average service period of approximately 1.7 years.
cash received from stock options exercised under these share-based payment arrangements during 2016, 2015 and 2014
was $15.3 million, $52.7 million and $56.1 million, respectively. the actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions for options exercised under these share-based payment arrangements during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $9.0
million, $6.0 million and $8.6 million, respectively.
performance share awards we granted performance share awards to certain employees under the 2014 stock incentive plan and the amended and restated 2010 stock incentive plan. the performance share awards are treated as an equity award and are paid in shares. whether the performance shares are earned depends upon the participant's continued employment through the performance period (except in the case of specific types of terminations) and our performance against three-year goals set at the beginning of the performance period. performance goals based on various factors must be achieved for any of the performance shares to be earned. if the performance requirements are not met, the performance shares will be forfeited, no compensation cost will be recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed. these awards have no maximum contractual term. dividend equivalents are credited on performance shares outstanding as of the record date. these dividend equivalents are only paid on the shares released. total performance share awards granted were 0.3 million, 0.3 million and 0.3 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the following is a summary of activity for the nonvested performance share awards:

the total intrinsic value of performance share awards vested was $18.1 million, $20.1 million and $11.4 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
performance share awards above represent initial target awards and do not reflect potential increases or decreases resulting from the final performance objectives to be determined at the end of the respective performance period.
the actual number of shares to be awarded at the end of each performance period will range between 0% and 150% of the initial target awards.

the fair value of performance share awards is determined based on the closing stock price of our common shares on the grant date. the weighted-average grant-date fair value of performance share awards granted during 2016, 2015
and 2014 was $37.38, $51.33 and $44.88, respectively.
as of december 31, 2016, we had $4.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested performance share awards granted. the cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average service period of approximately 1.5 years.
actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions for performance share awards paid out under these share-based payment arrangements for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $4.8 million, $7.4 million and $4.0 million, respectively.
restricted stock units we issue restricted stock units under the 2014 stock incentive plan, the 2014 directors stock plan, the amended and restated 2010 stock incentive plan, the 2005 directors stock plan, the stock incentive plan, and the directors stock plan. restricted stock units are treated as an equity award and are paid in shares. these awards have no maximum contractual term. dividend equivalents are credited on restricted stock units outstanding as of the record date. these dividend equivalents are only paid on the shares released. restricted stock units granted were 1.3
million, 0.9 million and 0.9 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
restricted stock units were issued to certain employees and agents pursuant to the 2014 stock incentive plan, the amended and restated 2010 stock incentive plan and stock incentive plan. under these plans, awards have graded or cliff vesting over a three-year service period. when service for pfg ceases (except in the case of specific types of terminations), all vesting stops and unvested units are forfeited.
pursuant to the 2014 directors stock plan and the 2005 directors stock plan, restricted stock units are granted to each non-employee director in office immediately following each annual meeting of stockholders and, at the discretion of the nominating and governance committee, to each person who becomes a member of the board other than on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders. under these plans, awards are granted on an annual basis and cliff vest after a one-year service period. when service to pfg ceases, all vesting stops and unvested units are forfeited.

the total intrinsic value of restricted stock units vested was $46.2 million, $53.6 million and $38.5 during 2016,
2015 and 2014, respectively.
the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the closing stock price of our common shares on the grant date. the weighted-average grant-date fair value of restricted stock units granted during 2016, 2015 and 2014
was $37.59, $51.35 and $45.03, respectively.
as of december 31, 2016, we had $45.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock unit awards granted under these plans. the cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-
average period of approximately 1.7 years.
the actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions for restricted stock unit payouts under these share-based payment arrangements for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $16.1 million, $18.8 million and $12.8 million, respectively.
employee stock purchase plan under our employee stock purchase plan, participating employees have the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock on a semi-annual basis. employees may purchase up to $25,000 worth of company stock each year.
employees may purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to 85% of the shares' fair market value as of the

we recognize compensation expense for the fair value of the discount granted to employees participating in the employee stock purchase plan in the period of grant. shares of the employee stock purchase plan are treated as an equity award. the weighted-average fair value of the discount on the stock purchased was $14.00, $7.29 and $8.94
during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the total intrinsic value of the employee stock purchase plan shares settled was $10.2 million, $4.1 million and $4.7 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

20. condensed consolidating financial information principal life has established special purpose entities to issue secured medium-term notes. under the program, the payment obligations of principal and interest on the notes are secured by funding agreements issued by principal life. principal life's payment obligations on the funding agreements are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by pfg. all of the outstanding stock of principal life is indirectly owned by pfg and pfg is the only guarantor of the payment obligations of the funding agreements.
the following tables set forth condensed consolidating financial information of (i) pfg, (ii) principal life, (iii)
principal financial services, inc. ("pfs") and all other direct and indirect subsidiaries of pfg on a combined basis and (iv) the eliminations necessary to arrive at the information for pfg on a consolidated basis as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, and for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
in presenting the condensed consolidating financial statements, the equity method of accounting has been applied to
(i) pfg's interest in all direct subsidiaries of pfg, (ii) principal life's interest in all direct subsidiaries of principal life and (iii) pfs's interest in principal life even though all such subsidiaries meet the requirements to be consolidated under u.s. gaap. earnings of subsidiaries are, therefore, reflected in the parent's investment and earnings. all intercompany balances and transactions, including elimination of the parent's investment in subsidiaries, between pfg, principal life and pfs and all other subsidiaries have been eliminated, as shown in the column "eliminations." these condensed consolidating financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements. the financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations, cash flows or financial position had the subsidiaries operated as independent entities.

on may 7, 2014, our shelf registration statement was filed with the sec and became effective, replacing the shelf registration that had been in effect since may 2011. under our current shelf registration, we have the ability to issue, in unlimited amounts, unsecured senior debt securities or subordinated debt securities, junior subordinated debt, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, depository shares, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units of pfg, trust preferred securities of three subsidiary trusts and guarantees by pfg of these trust preferred securities. our wholly owned subsidiary, pfs, may guarantee, fully and unconditionally or otherwise, our obligations with respect to any non-convertible securities, other than common stock, described in the shelf registration.
the following tables set forth condensed consolidating financial information of (i) pfg, (ii) pfs, (iii) principal life and all other direct and indirect subsidiaries of pfg on a combined basis and (iv) the eliminations necessary to arrive at the information for pfg on a consolidated basis as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, and for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
in presenting the condensed consolidating financial statements, the equity method of accounting has been applied to
(i) pfg's interest in all direct subsidiaries of pfg and (ii) pfs's interest in principal life and all other subsidiaries, where applicable, even though all such subsidiaries meet the requirements to be consolidated under u.s. gaap. earnings of subsidiaries are, therefore, reflected in the parent's investment and earnings. all intercompany balances and transactions, including elimination of the parent's investment in subsidiaries, between pfg, pfs and principal life and all other subsidiaries have been eliminated, as shown in the column "eliminations."
these condensed consolidating financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements. the financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations, cash flows or financial position had the subsidiaries operated as independent entities.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis discusses our financial condition as of december 31, 2016, compared with december 31, 2015, and our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, and, where appropriate, factors that may affect our future financial performance. the discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the financial statements and the other financial information included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
forward-looking information our narrative analysis below contains forward-looking statements intended to enhance the reader's ability to assess our future financial performance. forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that represent our beliefs concerning future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments, and contain words and phrases such as "anticipate," "believe," "plan," "estimate," "expect," "intend," and other similar expressions. forward-looking statements are made based upon management's current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.
33
actual results may differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties. those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risk factors listed in item 1a. "risk factors."
overview we provide financial products and services through the following reportable segments:
 retirement and income solutions;
 principal global investors;
 principal international and
 u.s. insurance solutions.
we also have a corporate segment, which consists of the assets and activities that have not been allocated to any other segment. see item 1. "business" for a description of our reportable segments.
economic factors and trends positive market performance and net customer cash flows led to account value increases in our retirement and income solutions segment and aum increases in our principal global investors segment. since account values and aum are the base by which these businesses generate revenues, the increase in account values and aum has contributed to the overall improvement of our operating revenues in these segments.
in our principal international segment, we continued to grow our business organically through our existing subsidiaries and joint ventures and through strategic acquisitions. local currency aum, a key indicator of earnings growth for the segment, increased significantly as a result of positive net customer cash flows and market performance. the financial results for the principal international segment are also impacted by fluctuations of the foreign currency to u.s. dollar exchange rates for the locations in which we have business.
the u.s. insurance solutions segment has been impacted by lower interest rates for the past few years, which has caused spread compression and led to higher reserves. this has resulted in changes to our product offerings.
profitability our profitability depends in large part upon our:
 amount of aum;
 ability to manage the difference between the investment income we earn and the interest we credit to policyholders;
 ability to generate fee revenues by providing administrative and investment management services;
 ability to price our insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the related expenses;
 ability to manage our investment portfolio to maximize investment returns and minimize risks such as interest rate changes or defaults or impairments of invested assets;
 ability to effectively hedge fluctuations in foreign currency to u.s. dollar exchange rates on certain transactions and
 ability to manage our operating expenses.
critical accounting policies and estimates the increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance requires us to closely monitor our accounting policies. our significant accounting policies are described in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 1, nature of operations and significant accounting policies." we have identified critical accounting policies that are complex and require significant judgment and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. a summary of our critical accounting policies is intended to enhance the reader's ability to assess our financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates and changes in guidance. the identification, selection and disclosure of critical accounting estimates and policies have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors.
valuation and impairment of fixed income investments fixed maturities.    fixed maturities include bonds, asset-backed securities ("abs"), redeemable preferred stock and certain non-redeemable preferred securities. we classify our fixed maturities as either afs or trading and, accordingly, carry them at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position. volatility in net income can result from
34
changes in fair value of fixed maturities classified as trading. volatility in other comprehensive income can result from changes in fair value of fixed maturities classified as afs.
the fair values of our public fixed maturities are primarily based on market prices from third party pricing vendors. we have regular interactions with these vendors to ensure we understand their pricing methodologies and to confirm they are utilizing observable market information. in addition, 6% of our invested asset portfolio as of december 31, 2016, was invested in privately placed fixed maturities with no readily available market quotes to determine the fair market value. the majority of these assets are valued using a matrix pricing valuation approach that utilizes observable market inputs. in the matrix approach, securities are grouped into pricing categories that vary by sector, rating and average life. each pricing category is assigned a risk spread based on studies of observable public market data from the investment professionals assigned to specific security classes. the expected cash flows of the security are then discounted back at the current treasury curve plus the appropriate risk spread. although the matrix valuation approach provides a fair valuation of each pricing category, the valuation of an individual security within each pricing category may actually be impacted by company specific factors.
if we are unable to price a fixed maturity security using prices from third party pricing vendors or other sources specific to the asset class, we may obtain a broker quote or utilize an internal pricing model specific to the asset utilizing relevant market information, to the extent available and where at least one significant unobservable input is utilized. these are reflected in level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and can include fixed maturities across all asset classes. as of december 31, 2016, less than 1% of our total fixed maturities were level 3 securities valued using internal pricing models. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 14, fair value measurements" for further discussion.
the $257.4 million increase in net unrealized gains from u.s. investment operations for the year ended december 31, 2016, can primarily be attributed to tightening of credit spreads, partially offset by an approximate 9 basis point increase in interest rates. for additional information about interest rate risk see item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk".
fixed maturities classified as afs are subject to impairment reviews. when evaluating fixed maturities for impairment, we consider relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether a credit or interest rate-related impairment of a security is other than temporary. relevant facts and circumstances considered include: (1) the extent and length of time the fair value has been below cost; (2) the reasons for the decline in value; (3) the financial position and access to capital of the issuer, including the current and future impact of any specific events; (4) for structured securities, the adequacy of the expected cash flows and (5) our intent to sell a security or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost which, in some cases, may extend to maturity. to the extent we determine a security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired, an impairment loss is recognized. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, investments  other-than-temporary impairments" for further discussion.
a number of significant risks and uncertainties are inherent in the process of monitoring credit impairments and determining if an impairment is other than temporary. these risks and uncertainties include: (1) the risk that our assessment of an issuer's ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that issuer; (2) the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated; (3) the risk that our investment professionals are making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers and (4) the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and circumstances lead us to change our intent to not sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost. any of these situations could result in a charge to net income in a future period. as of december 31, 2016, we had $17,466.4 million in afs fixed maturities with gross unrealized losses totaling $648.8 million. included in the gross unrealized losses are losses attributable to both movements in market interest rates as well as movement in credit spreads.
mortgage loans.    mortgage loans consist primarily of commercial mortgage loans on real estate. as of december 31, 2016, the carrying value of our commercial mortgage loans was $12,027.8 million. commercial mortgage loans on real estate are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method and net of valuation allowances.
commercial mortgage loans on real estate are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to contractual terms of the loan agreement. when we determine a loan is impaired, a valuation allowance is established equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the mortgage loan and the estimated value reduced by the cost to sell. estimated value is based on either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price or fair value of the collateral. subsequent changes in the estimated value are reflected in the valuation allowance. amounts on loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged off and removed from the valuation allowance. the change in the valuation allowance provision is included in net realized capital gains (losses) on our consolidated statements of operations.
the valuation allowance is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated probable credit losses. management's periodic evaluation and assessment of the valuation allowance adequacy is based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of
35
the underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, portfolio delinquency information, underwriting standards, peer group information, current economic conditions, loss experience and other relevant factors. the evaluation of our impaired loan component is subjective, as it requires the estimation of timing and amount of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans. for more detailed information concerning mortgage loan valuation allowances and impairments, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, investments  mortgage loan valuation allowance."
we have a large experienced commercial real estate staff centrally located in des moines, which includes commercial mortgage underwriters, loan closers, loan servicers, engineers, appraisers, credit analysts, research staff, legal staff, information technology personnel and portfolio managers. experienced commercial real estate senior management adheres to a disciplined process in reviewing all transactions for approval on a consistent basis. during 2016, the typical new commercial mortgage loan at origination averaged 52% loan-to-value with a 2.6 times debt service coverage ratio and was internally rated a on a bond equivalent basis. our entire commercial mortgage loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans held in our principal global investors segment, averaged 46% loan-to-value ratio with a 2.7 times debt service coverage ratio as of december 31, 2016. the large equity cushion and strong debt service coverage in our commercial mortgage loan investments will help insulate us from stress during times of weak commercial real estate fundamentals.
derivatives we primarily use derivatives to hedge or reduce exposure to market risks. the fair values of exchange-traded derivatives are determined through quoted market prices. the fair values of derivative instruments cleared through centralized clearinghouses are determined through market prices published by the clearinghouses. the fair values of non-cleared over-the-counter ("otc") derivative instruments are determined using either pricing valuation models that utilize market observable inputs or broker quotes. on an absolute fair value basis as of december 31, 2016, 53% of our otc derivative assets and liabilities were valued using pricing valuation models, 43% using clearinghouse prices and the remaining 4% using broker quotes. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 14, fair value measurements" for further discussion. the fair values of our derivative instruments can be impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, equity indices and volatility, as well as other contributing factors. for additional information see item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk".
we also issue certain annuity contracts and other insurance contracts that include embedded derivatives that have been bifurcated from the host contract. they are valued using a combination of historical data and actuarial judgment. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 14, fair value measurements" for further discussion. we include our assumption for own non-performance risk in the valuation of these embedded derivatives. as our credit spreads widen or tighten, the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities decrease or increase, leading to an increase or decrease in net income. if the current market credit spreads reflecting our own creditworthiness move to zero (tighten), the reduction to net income would be approximately $76.7 million, net of dac and income taxes, based on december 31, 2016, reported amounts. in addition, the policyholder behavior assumptions used in the valuation of embedded derivatives include risk margins, which increase the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities.
the accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of the applicable accounting standards continue to evolve. judgment is applied in determining the availability and application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment. judgment and estimates are used to determine the fair value of some of our derivatives. volatility in net income can result from changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting and changes in fair value of embedded derivatives.
deferred acquisition costs and other actuarial balances incremental direct costs of contract acquisition as well as certain costs directly related to acquisition activities (underwriting, policy issuance and processing, medical and inspection and sales force contract selling) for the successful acquisition of new and renewal insurance policies and investment contract business are capitalized to the extent recoverable. commissions and other incremental direct costs of contract acquisition for the acquisition of long-term service contracts are also capitalized to the extent recoverable. maintenance costs and acquisition costs that are not deferrable are charged to net income as incurred.
amortization based on estimated gross profits.    dac for universal life-type insurance contracts and certain investment contracts are amortized over the expected lifetime of the contracts in relation to estimated gross profits ("egps"). as of december 31, 2016, these policies accounted for 62% of our total dac balance. in addition to dac, the following actuarial balances are also amortized in relation to egps.
 sales inducement asset  sales inducements are amounts that are credited to the contractholder's account balance as an inducement to purchase the contract. like dac, the cost of the sales inducement is capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the contract, in proportion to egps.
36
 unearned revenue liability  an unearned revenue liability is established when we collect fees or other policyholder assessments that represent compensation for services to be provided in future periods. these revenues are deferred and then amortized over the expected life of the contract, in proportion to egps.
 reinsurance asset or liability  for universal-life type products that are reinsured, a reinsurance asset or liability is established to spread the expected net reinsurance costs or profits in proportion to the egps on the underlying business.
we also have additional benefit reserves that are established for annuity or universal life-type contracts that provide benefit guarantees, or for contracts that are expected to produce profits followed by losses. the liabilities are accrued in relation to estimated contract assessments.
key assumptions used in the calculation of egps include mortality, morbidity, lapses, equity returns, general account investment yields and expenses as well as the change in our liability for certain guarantees and the difference between actual and expected reinsurance premiums and recoveries, depending on the nature of the contract. our general account investment yield assumption reflects our long-term projections of interest rates and net realized capital gains (losses). we develop an estimate of egps at issue and each valuation date. as actual experience and market conditions emerge, the gross profits may vary from those expected either in magnitude or timing, in which case a true-up of actuarial balances occurs as a charge or credit to current net income. in addition, we are required to revise our assumptions regarding future experience if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised; we refer to this as unlocking. both actions, reflecting actual experience and market conditions and changing future estimates, can change both the current amount and the future amortization pattern of the dac asset and related actuarial balances.
for individual variable life insurance, individual variable annuities and group annuities that have separate account u.s. equity investment options, we utilize a mean reversion methodology (reversion to the mean assumption), a common industry practice, to determine the future domestic equity market growth rate assumption used for the calculation of egps. if actual annualized u.s. equity market performance varies from our 8% long-term assumption, we assume different performance levels in the short-term such that the weighted average return is equal to the long-term assumption over the mean reversion period. however, our mean reversion process generally limits assumed returns to a range of 4-12% during the mean reversion period.
amortization based on estimated gross revenues.    dac and certain of the actuarial balances on a portion of our universal life products are amortized in proportion to estimated gross revenues rather than egps. estimated gross revenues include similar assumptions as the revenue component of egps and the changes of future estimates and reflection of actual experience and market conditions is done in the same manner as egps discussed above. as of december 31, 2016, these policies accounted for 8% of our total dac balance.
amortization based on estimated gross margins.    dac for participating life insurance products are amortized in proportion to estimated gross margins ("egms") rather than egps. egms include similar assumption items as egps, and amortization schedules were developed using models last updated when we stopped selling participating business in the early 2000s. some products allow for underwritten death benefit increases and cost of living adjustments, resulting in a material amount of new dac each year, and the amortization schedules are modified as appropriate. as of december 31, 2016, these policies accounted for 4% of our total dac balance.
amortization based on premium-paying period.    dac for non-participating term life insurance and individual disability policies are amortized over the premium-paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing policyholder liabilities. once these assumptions are made for a given policy or group of policies, they will not be changed over the life of the policy unless a loss recognition event occurs. as of december 31, 2016, these policies accounted for 21% of our total dac balance.
amortization based on service period.    dac for long-term service contracts are amortized in proportion to the revenue recognized or straight-line if no pattern of revenue recognition can be reasonably predicted. we amortize capitalized costs of long-term service contracts on a straight-line basis, reflecting lapses as they are incurred, over the expected contract life. as of december 31, 2016, these contracts accounted for 5% of our total dac balance.
internal replacements.    we review policies for modifications that result in the exchange of an existing contract for a new contract. if the new contract is determined to be an internal replacement that is substantially changed from the replaced contract, any unamortized dac and related actuarial balances are written off and acquisition costs related to the new contract are capitalized as appropriate. if the new contract is substantially unchanged from the replaced contract, we continue to amortize the existing dac and related actuarial balances.
recoverability.    dac and sales inducement assets are subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issue and loss recognition testing on an annual basis, or when an event occurs that may warrant loss recognition. if loss recognition or impairment is necessary, the asset balances are written off to the extent it is determined that future policy premiums and investment income or gross profits are not adequate to cover related losses and expenses.
actuarial assumption updates.    we periodically review and update actuarial assumptions that are inputs to the models for dac and other actuarial balances and make model refinements as necessary. for more information see "transactions affecting comparability of results of operations  other  actuarial assumption updates."
37
sensitivities.    as of december 31, 2016, the net balance of dac and related actuarial balances, excluding balances affected by changes in other comprehensive income ("oci"), was a $1,445.1 million asset. we perform sensitivity analyses to assess the impact that certain assumptions have on these balances. the following table shows the estimated immediate impact of various assumption changes on our dac and related actuarial balances.

reducing the future equity return assumption by 1%                           $(7       )

reflects the net impact of changes to the dac asset, sales inducement asset, unearned revenue liability, reinsurance asset or liability, additional benefit reserves and related taxes. includes the impact on net income of changes in dac and related actuarial balances for our equity method subsidiaries. the dac and related actuarial balances of the equity method subsidiaries are not included in the total dac balance listed above as they are not fully consolidated.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets include the cost of acquired subsidiaries in excess of the fair value of the net tangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions. goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, we test the carrying value for impairment at least annually. goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is a business one level below the operating segment. we formally conduct our annual goodwill and other intangible asset impairment testing during the third quarter. under certain circumstances, interim impairment tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
the operating segments and associated reporting units at which we perform our testing are as follows:
 retirement and income solutions: retirement and income solutions  fee and retirement and income solutions  spread
 principal global investors: equity investments, fixed income investments, real estate and other alternative investments, mutual funds complex
 principal international: countries in which principal international does business
 u.s. insurance solutions: specialty benefits insurance and individual life insurance
 corporate: corporate subsidiaries goodwill.    u.s. gaap permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test of the two-step goodwill impairment test. we continue to perform a two-step test in our evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill.
in step 1 of the evaluation, the fair value of each reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. if the fair value is greater than the carrying value, the carrying value of the reporting unit is deemed to be recoverable, and step 2 is not required. after completion of our 2016 step 1 analysis, it was determined that fair values exceeded the carrying amounts for all businesses one level below the operating segment and we did not have any business at risk of failing the step 1 goodwill impairment test. if the fair value estimate had been less than the carrying value, it is an indicator that impairment may exist, and step 2 would be required. in step 2, the reporting unit's goodwill implied fair value is determined. the reporting unit's fair value as determined in step 1 is assigned to all of its net assets (recognized and unrecognized) as if the reporting unit were acquired in a business combination as of the date of the impairment test. if the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and written down to its implied fair value.
the determination of fair value for our reporting units is primarily based on an income approach whereby we use discounted cash flows for each reporting unit. when available, and as appropriate, we use market approaches or other valuation techniques to corroborate discounted cash flow results. the discounted cash flow model used for each reporting unit is based on either income or distributable cash flow, depending on the reporting unit being valued. we use different discount rates based upon the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with the operations.
for the income model, we determine fair value based on the present value of the most recent income projections for each reporting unit and calculate a terminal value utilizing a terminal growth rate. the significant assumptions in the operating income model include: income projections, including the underlying assumptions; discount rate and terminal growth rate.
for the distributable cash flow model, we determine fair value based on the present value of projected statutory net income and changes in required capital to determine distributable income for the respective reporting unit. the significant assumptions in the distributable cash flow model include: required capital levels; income projections, including
38
the underlying assumptions; discount rate; new business projection period and new business production growth. we did not recognize an impairment in our 2016 consolidated statement of operations.
other intangible assets.    u.s. gaap permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an intangible asset with an indefinite life is less than its carrying amount to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment. we utilize the qualitative approach on a limited basis for testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives. intangible assets with finite lives are amortized as related benefits emerge and are reviewed periodically for indicators of impairment in value. if facts and circumstances suggest possible impairment, the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is compared to the current carrying value of the asset. if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of assets over their fair value. for those assets amortized as related benefits emerge, the most significant assumptions involved in the estimation of future benefits include surrender/lapse rates and interest margins. we did not recognize an impairment in our 2016 consolidated statement of operations.
sensitivities.    in connection with our annual impairment testing process, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. the most significant goodwill and other intangible assets within our 2016 consolidated statement of financial position resulted from our 2013 acquisition of cuprum, whereby we recorded $631.8 million of goodwill, and from our 2006 purchase of wm advisors, inc., whereby we acquired $608.0 million of investment management contracts which are considered an indefinite-lived intangible. we cannot predict certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets that totaled $1,020.8 million and $1,325.3 million, respectively, as of december 31, 2016. such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on our customer base, interest rate movements, declines in the equity markets, the legal environment in which the businesses operate or a material negative change in our relationships with significant customers. for further information see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 14, nature of operations and significant accounting policies," and "note 2, goodwill and other intangible assets."
insurance reserves reserves are liabilities representing estimates of the amounts that will come due, at some point in the future, to or on behalf of our policyholders. u.s. gaap, allowing for some degree of managerial judgment, provides guidance for establishing reserves.
future policy benefits and claims include reserves for individual traditional and group life insurance, disability, health and long-term care insurance and individual and group annuities that provide periodic income payments. these reserves are computed using assumptions of mortality, morbidity, lapse, investment performance and expense. these assumptions are based on our experience, industry results, emerging trends and future expectations. for long-duration insurance contracts, once these assumptions are made for a given policy or group of policies, they will not be changed over the life of the policy. however, significant changes in experience or assumptions may require us to provide for expected future losses on a product by establishing premium deficiency reserves. premium deficiency reserves may also be established for short-duration contracts to provide for expected future losses. our reserve levels are reviewed throughout the year using internal analysis including, among other things, experience studies, claim development analysis and annual loss recognition analysis. to the extent experience indicates potential loss recognition, we recognize losses on certain lines of business. the ultimate accuracy of the assumptions on these long-tailed insurance products cannot be determined until the obligation of the entire block of business on which the assumptions were made is extinguished. short-term variances of actual results from the assumptions used in the computation of the reserves are reflected in current period net income and can impact quarter-to-quarter net income.
future policy benefits and claims also include reserves for incurred but unreported health, disability, dental, vision and life insurance claims. we recognize claims costs in the period the service was provided to our policyholders. however, claims costs incurred in a particular period are not known with certainty until after we receive, process and pay the claims. we determine the amount of this liability using actuarial methods based on historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging cost trends, where applicable, to determine our estimate of claim liabilities. we also look back to assess how our prior periods' estimates developed. to the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period claim expense. historically, the amount of the claim reserve adjustment made in subsequent reporting periods for prior period estimates have been within a reasonable range given our normal claim fluctuations.
we periodically review and update actuarial assumptions that are used to compute reserves. for more information see "transactions affecting comparability of results of operations  other  actuarial assumption updates."
benefit plans the reported expense and liability associated with pension and opeb plans requires the use of assumptions. numerous assumptions are made regarding the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, turnover,
39
expected compensation increases, health care claim costs, health care cost trends, retirement rates and mortality. the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets have the most significant impact on the level of expense.
the assumed discount rate is determined by projecting future benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligation and discounting those cash flows using a spot yield curve for high quality corporate bonds. our assumed discount rates were 4.15% for our pension plans and 3.75% for our opeb plans as of december 31, 2016. typically a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase the pension benefits projected benefit obligation and the net periodic pension cost ("nppc") by approximately $114.0 million and $6.6 million, respectively. typically a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase the other postretirement benefits accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $2.4 million and would have a nominal impact on the net periodic benefit cost ("npbc"). typically a 0.25% increase in the discount rate would result in decreases in benefit obligations and expenses at a level generally commensurate with those noted above.
the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is set at the long-term rate expected to be earned based on the long-term investment policy of the plans and the various classes of the invested funds. historical and future expected returns of multiple asset classes were analyzed to develop a risk-free real rate of return and risk premiums for each asset class. the overall long-term rate for each asset class was developed by combining a long-term inflation component, the real risk free rate of return and the associated risk premium. a weighted average rate was developed based on long-term returns for each asset class, the plan's target asset allocation policy and the tax structure of the trusts. for the 2016 nppc and 2016 npbc, a 7.20% and 5.24% weighted average long-term rate of return was used, respectively. for the 2017 nppc and 2017 npbc, a 6.70% and 4.40% weighted average long-term rate of return assumption, respectively, will be used. typically a 0.25% decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return would increase the nppc by approximately $5.4 million and the npbc by approximately $1.6 million. typically a 0.25% increase in this rate would result in a decrease to expense at the same levels. the assumed return on plan assets is based on the fair market value of plan assets as of december 31, 2016.
the compensation increase assumption is generally set at a rate consistent with current and expected long-term compensation and salary policy, including inflation.
actuarial gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line amortization method over the average remaining service period of employees, which is approximately 10 years for pension costs and approximately 4 years for other postretirement benefit costs. the qualified pension plan does not utilize the allowable corridor, while the nonqualified pension plan and opeb plans utilize the 10% corridor. prior service costs are amortized on a weighted average basis over approximately 1 year for pension costs and 2 years for opeb costs. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, employee and agent benefits" for further discussion.
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of the liability for taxes due. our tax accounting represents management's best estimate of various events and transactions, such as completion of tax audits or establishment of, or changes to, a valuation allowance associated with certain deferred tax assets, which could affect our estimates and effective income tax rate in a particular quarter or annual period. deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. we are required to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realizable. in determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider many factors, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in prior carryback years and implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies management would employ to realize the tax benefit.
u.s. federal and state deferred income taxes have not been provided on approximately $1,088.4 million and $1,004.6 million of accumulated but undistributed earnings from operations of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we do not record u.s. federal and state deferred income taxes on foreign earnings not expected to be distributed to the u.s. we apply an exception to the general rule, which under u.s. gaap otherwise requires the recording of u.s. deferred income taxes on the anticipated repatriation of foreign earnings as recognized for financial reporting purposes. the exception permits us to not record a u.s. deferred income tax liability on foreign earnings we expect to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations. the related deferred income taxes will be recorded in the period it becomes apparent we can no longer positively assert some or all the undistributed earnings will remain invested into the foreseeable future.
inherent in the provision for income taxes are estimates and our expectations regarding the deductibility of certain items, the timing of income and expense recognition, future performance and the current or future realization of operating losses, capital losses and certain tax credits. we regularly evaluate the capital needs of our domestic and foreign operations considering all available information, including operating and capital plans, regulatory capital requirements, parent company financing and cash flow needs, as well as tax laws applicable to our domestic and foreign subsidiaries. in the event these estimates differ from our prior estimates due to the receipt of new information, we may be required to significantly change the provision for income taxes recorded in the consolidated financial statements. any such change
40
could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these estimates change. a significant decline in value of financial assets could lead to establishment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets having an adverse effect on current and future results. in management's judgment, total deferred income tax assets are more-likely-than-not to be realized.
in addition, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits in the u.s. as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. tax benefits are recognized for book purposes when the more-likely-than-not threshold is met with regard to the validity of an uncertain tax position. once this threshold is met, for each uncertain tax position we recognize in earnings the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the internal revenue service or other income taxing authorities for audits ongoing or not yet commenced.
we had $242.9 million and $229.9 million of current income tax receivables associated with outstanding audit issues reported as other assets in our consolidated statements of financial position as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we believe there are adequate defenses against, or sufficient provisions for, the contested issues, but final resolution of contested issues could take several years while legal remedies are pursued. consequently, we do not anticipate the ultimate resolution of audits ongoing or not yet commenced to have a material impact on our net income.
transactions affecting comparability of results of operations acquisitions we entered into acquisition agreements for the following businesses.
axa hong kong pension business.    on september 1, 2015, we finalized the purchase of axa's mpf and orso pension business in hong kong for $335.5 million. as part of the transaction, we entered into an exclusive 15-year distribution agreement with axa to provide co-branded pension products through axa's extensive agency network in hong kong. we more than doubled the aum in our hong kong pension business to $5.9 billion. axa's mpf and orso pension business is consolidated within our principal international segment.
columbus circle investors.    on september 30, 2014, we acquired an additional 24.65% interest in columbus circle investors from the minority shareholder partners and contracted to purchase the remaining interest from the minority shareholder partners in two installments. the first installment for an additional 2.5% interest was paid on april 28, 2015. the second installment for the remaining 2.5% interest was paid on april 28, 2016. we now own 100% of columbus circle investors, which is consolidated within our principal global investors segment.
other actuarial assumption updates.    we periodically review and update actuarial assumptions that are inputs to the models for dac and other actuarial balances and make model refinements as necessary. during the third quarter of 2016, assumption updates and model refinements were made resulting in an unlocking of dac and other actuarial balances that decreased total company net income by $68.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the pre-tax operating earnings impact was $(33.2) million for our u.s. insurance solutions segment, $(31.6) million for our retirement and income solutions segment and $(8.9) million for our principal international segment for the year ended december 31, 2016.
during the third quarter of 2015, assumption updates and model refinements were made resulting in an unlocking of dac and other actuarial balances that increased total company net income by $26.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the pre-tax operating earnings impact was $76.8 million for our u.s. insurance solutions segment and $(28.7) million for our retirement and income solutions segment for the year ended december 31, 2015.
during the third quarter of 2014, assumption updates and model refinements were made resulting in an unlocking of dac and other actuarial balances that increased total company net income by $45.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the pre-tax operating earnings impact was $60.0 million for our u.s. insurance solutions segment and $2.6 million for our retirement and income solutions segment for the year ended december 31, 2014.
the individual life insurance business actuarial assumption updates and model refinements had the most significant impact and affected several line items within our income statement. the following table presents the increase (decrease) on the individual life insurance income statement line items for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

chilean legal entity merger.    in january 2015, we received regulatory approval and executed upon the merger of two of our chilean legal entities. as a result of the merger, we recognized a $105.2 million benefit in net income available to common stockholders in first quarter 2015 to reflect a change in deferred tax balances related to the merged entity.
other factors affecting comparability fluctuations in foreign currency to u.s. dollar exchange rates fluctuations in foreign currency to u.s. dollar exchange rates for locations in which we have operations can affect reported financial results. in years when foreign currencies weaken against the u.s. dollar, translating foreign currencies into u.s. dollars results in fewer u.s. dollars to be reported. when foreign currencies strengthen, translating foreign currencies into u.s. dollars results in more u.s. dollars to be reported.
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations create variances in our financial statement line items. the most significant impact occurs within our principal international segment where pre-tax operating earnings were negatively impacted $25.3 million and $69.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency to u.s. dollar exchange rates. this impact was calculated by comparing (a) the difference between current year results and prior year results to (b) the difference between current year results and prior year results translated using current year exchange rates for both periods. we use this approach to calculate the impact of exchange rates on all revenue and expense line items. for a discussion of our approaches to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk, see item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  foreign currency risk."
effects of inflation the impact of inflation has not had a material effect on our annual consolidated results of operations over the past three years. however, we may be materially affected by inflation in the future.
variable investment income variable investment income includes certain types of investment returns such as prepayment fees and income (loss) from certain elements of our other alternative asset classes, including results of value-add real estate sales activity. due to its unpredictable nature, variable investment income may or may not be material to our financial results for a given reporting period and may create variances when comparing different reporting periods. for additional information, see "investments  investment results."
recent regulatory changes on april 6, 2016, the dol released its final fiduciary definition regulation package. the regulation broadens the definition of a fiduciary under erisa to include persons providing investment advice to an employee benefit plan or an ira for a fee or other compensation. the dol also released two new prohibited transaction class exemptions and amendments to current prohibited transaction exemptions. broker-dealers and advisors are in various stages of determining the implications of the regulations on their business models, and how they proceed could impact our business. even with this fluid environment, our preliminary assessment of the new regulation's impact to our business and future financial results indicates the costs will not have a significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations. as the rules become applicable and are operationalized, we will assess what business impacts need to be addressed and how they affect the organization.

year ended december 31, 2016 compared to year ended december 31, 2015
net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders increased $158.4 million as a result of after-tax net realized capital gains in 2016 as compared to after-tax net realized capital losses in 2015 primarily related to derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. in addition, net income available to common stockholders increased due to a $128.8 million increase in after-tax net investment income attributable to higher average invested assets in our u.s. operations and a $45.6 million increase in after-tax variable investment income. these increases were partially offset by a $105.2 million benefit from a change in deferred tax balances related to the merger of two of our chilean legal entities in 2015 and a $95.0 million after-tax decrease related to actuarial assumption updates and model refinements that had an unfavorable impact on net income in 2016 as compared to a favorable impact in 2015. additionally, these increases were partially offset by a $49.1 million decrease attributable to lower investment yields on invested assets in our u.s. operations.
total revenues premiums decreased $150.5 million for the retirement and income solutions segment primarily due to lower sales of individual annuities with life contingencies. premiums increased $117.7 million for the u.s. insurance solutions segment primarily resulting from growth in the business. premiums increased for the principal international segment primarily in latin america due to $28.0 million higher sales of single premium annuities with life contingencies in chile partially offset by $6.3 million weakening of the chilean peso against the u.s. dollar.
fees and other revenues decreased $75.8 million for the corporate segment primarily due to income on a tax indemnification recognized in 2015. fees and other revenues decreased $35.5 million for the retirement and income solutions segment primarily due to challenging equity market performance. fees and other revenues increased $42.3 million for the u.s. insurance solutions segment primarily resulting from growth in the business. fees and other revenues increased $37.7 million for the principal global investors segment primarily due to increased aum.

net investment income increased primarily due to $198.1 million attributable to higher average invested assets in our u.s. operations and a $70.1 million increase in variable investment income. these increases were partially offset by a $75.6 million decrease attributable to lower investment yields on invested assets in our u.s. operations. for additional information, see "investments  investment results  net investment income."
net realized capital gains (losses) can be volatile due to other-than-temporary impairments of invested assets, mark-to-market adjustments of certain invested assets and our decision to sell invested assets. we had net realized capital gains in 2016 as compared to net realized capital losses in 2015 primarily due to change in derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. for additional information, see "investments  investment results  net realized capital gains (losses)."
total expenses benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased for the u.s. insurance solutions segment primarily due to a $117.3 million increase resulting from an unfavorable unlocking impact associated with actuarial assumption updates and model refinements in 2016 as compared to a favorable unlocking impact in 2015. additionally, benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $90.1 million for the u.s. insurance solutions segment resulting from growth in our specialty benefits insurance business.
operating expenses increased for the corporate segment primarily due to $86.4 million of one-time costs incurred to extinguish long-term debt in 2016 and $10.0 million higher interest expense in 2016 associated with the issuance of long-term debt in 2015. these increases were partially offset by a $42.8 million negative impact of a court ruling on some uncertain tax positions in 2015.
income taxes the effective income tax rates were 14% and 12% for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 10, income taxes  effective income tax rate" for further discussion.
year ended december 31, 2015 compared to year ended december 31, 2014
net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders increased primarily due to a $105.2 million change in deferred tax balances related to the merger of two of our chilean legal entities and a $44.2 million impairment of liongate, an equity method investment, in 2014. these increases were partially offset by a $35.9 million after-tax decrease in gains on sales of real estate investments and joint venture real estate, net losses in 2015 compared to net gains in 2014 resulting from a $17.6 million after-tax decrease in equity securities, trading and a $14.2 million after-tax write-off of unamortized book value on corporate owned real estate in 2015.
total revenues premiums increased $1,426.9 million for the retirement and income solutions segment primarily due to higher sales of single premium group and individual annuities with life contingencies. the single premium group annuity product, which is typically used to fund defined benefit plan terminations, can generate large premiums from very few customers and therefore premiums tend to vary from period to period.
fee revenues increased $88.5 million for the principal global investors segment primarily due to higher management fee revenue as a result of increased aum. fee revenues increased $52.9 million for the corporate segment primarily due to income on a tax indemnification.
net investment income decreased primarily due to a $97.5 million decrease attributable to lower investment yields on invested assets and cash in our u.s. operations. in addition, net investment income decreased $85.6 million due to the weakening of the latin american currencies against the u.s. dollar. for additional information, see "investments  investment results  net investment income."
net realized capital gains (losses) can be volatile due to other-than-temporary impairments of invested assets, mark-to-market adjustments of certain invested assets and our decision to sell invested assets. we had net realized capital losses in 2015 as compared to net realized capital gains in 2014 primarily due to a $55.2 million decrease in gains on sales of real estate investments and joint venture real estate, net losses in 2015 compared to net gains in 2014 resulting from a $25.1 million decrease in equity securities, trading, a $21.9 million write-off of unamortized book value on corporate owned real estate in 2015 and $11.4 million of increased losses on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. this was partially offset by a $44.2 million impairment of liongate, an equity method investment, in 2014. for additional information, see "investments  investment results  net realized capital gains (losses)."

total expenses benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $1,391.5 million for the retirement and income solutions segment primarily due to an increase in reserves resulting from higher sales of single premium group and individual annuities with life contingencies.
operating expenses increased for the retirement and income solutions segment primarily due to a $30.6 million increase resulting from unfavorable dac unlocking associated with the review and update of our actuarial assumptions in 2015 and a $26.5 million increase in staff related costs including pension and opeb. operating expenses increased $48.1 million for the principal global investors segment primarily due to expenses supporting growth in the business.
income taxes the effective income tax rates were 12% and 21% for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the effective income tax rate decreased to 12% from 21% for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily due to a 7% change in deferred tax balances related to the merger of two of our chilean legal entities and a 4% change in net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the third quarter 2014 enactment of tax legislation in chile not replicated in 2015, partially offset by the 3% negative impact of a court ruling on some uncertain tax positions. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 10, income taxes  effective income tax rate" for further discussion.
results of operations by segment for results of operations by segment see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 16, segment information."
retirement and income solutions segment retirement and income solutions trends several key factors impact revenue and earnings growth in the retirement and income solutions segment. these factors include: the ability of our distribution channels to generate new sales and retain existing business; pricing decisions that take account of competitive conditions, persistency, investment returns, mortality trends, and operating expense levels; investment management performance; equity market returns and interest rate changes. profitability ultimately depends on our ability to price products and invest assets at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring and administering those products.
net revenue is a key metric used to understand retirement and income solutions earnings growth. net revenue is defined as operating revenues less benefits, claims and settlement expenses less dividends to policyholders. net revenue from retirement and income solutions  fee is primarily fee based and is impacted by changes in the equity markets. net revenue from retirement and income solutions  spread is driven by the difference between investment income earned on the underlying general account assets and the interest rate credited to the contracts.

principal international segment principal international trends our principal international businesses focus on locations with growing middle classes, favorable demographics and increasing long-term savings, ideally with voluntary or mandatory pension markets. with variations depending upon the specific location, we have targeted these markets for sales of retirement and related products and services, including mutual funds, asset management, income annuities and life insurance accumulation products to businesses and individuals.
we have pursued our international strategy through a combination of acquisitions, start-up operations and joint ventures, which require infusions of capital consistent with our strategy of long-term growth and profitability.
principal international segment summary financial data aum is generally a key indicator of earnings growth for the segment, as aum is the base by which we can generate local currency profits. the cuprum business in chile differs in that the majority of fees are collected with each deposit by the mandatory retirement customers, based on a capped salary level, as opposed to asset levels. net customer cash flow and market performance are the two main drivers of local currency aum growth. net customer cash flow reflects our ability to attract and retain client deposits. market performance reflects the investment returns on our underlying aum. our financial results are also impacted by fluctuations of the foreign currency to u.s. dollar exchange rates for the locations in which we have business. aum of our foreign subsidiaries is translated into u.s. dollar equivalents at the end of the reporting period using the spot foreign exchange rates. revenue and expenses for our foreign subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollar equivalents at the average foreign exchange rates for the reporting period.

u.s. insurance solutions segment several key drivers impact earnings growth in the u.s. insurance solutions segment. the ability of our distribution channels to generate new sales and retain existing business drives growth in our premium and fees. our earnings growth also depends on our ability to price our products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring and administering those products. factors impacting pricing decisions include competitive conditions, economic trends, retention, our ability to assess and manage trends in mortality and morbidity and our ability to manage operating expenses.
u.s. insurance solutions insurance trends premium and fees are a key metric for growth in the u.s. insurance solutions segment. we receive premiums on our specialty benefits insurance products as well as our traditional life insurance products. fees are generated from our specialty benefits fee-for-service products as well as our universal life and variable universal life insurance products.
premium and fees are influenced by economic, industry and regulatory trends. in our specialty benefits insurance business, premium and fees growth is a result of strong retention and sales, as well as continued in-group growth. in our individual life insurance business, we have intentionally decreased sales of certain interest sensitive products in favor of more traditional products due to the low interest rate environment.

liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources represent the overall strength of a company and its ability to generate strong cash flows, borrow funds at a competitive rate and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs. our legal entity structure has an impact on our ability to meet cash flow needs as an organization. following is a simplified organizational structure.
liquidity our liquidity requirements have been and will continue to be met by funds from consolidated operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper, common stock, debt or other capital securities and borrowings from credit facilities. we believe the cash flows from these sources are sufficient to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of our operations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies.
we maintain a level of cash and securities which, combined with expected cash inflows from investments and operations, is believed to be adequate to meet anticipated short-term and long-term payment obligations. we will continue our prudent capital management practice of regularly exploring options available to us to maximize capital flexibility, including accessing the capital markets and careful attention to and management of expenses.
we perform rigorous liquidity stress testing to ensure our asset portfolio includes sufficient high quality liquid assets that could be utilized to bolster our liquidity position under increasingly stressed market conditions. these assets could be utilized as collateral for secured borrowing transactions with various third parties or by selling the securities in the open market if needed.
we also manage liquidity risk by limiting the sales of liabilities with features such as puts or other options that can be exercised against the company at inopportune times. for example, as of december 31, 2016, approximately $9.5 billion, or 99%, of our institutional guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements cannot be redeemed by contractholders prior to maturity. our individual annuity liabilities also contain surrender charges and other provisions limiting early surrenders.
the following table summarizes the withdrawal characteristics of our domestic general account investment contracts as of december 31, 2016.

not subject to discretionary withdrawal                       $10,499.3            34.6      %

specified surrender charges                                          6,950.3       22.9
market value adjustments                                             6,188.3       20.4

total domestic investment contracts                           $30,362.7            100.0     %
universal life insurance and certain traditional life insurance policies are also subject to discretionary withdrawals by policyholders. however, life insurance policies tend to be less susceptible to withdrawal than our investment contracts because policyholders may be subject to a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new life insurance policy. in addition, our life insurance liabilities include surrender charges to discourage early surrenders.
as of both december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, we had short-term credit facilities with various financial institutions in an aggregate amount of $1,005.0 million. as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, we had $51.4 million and $181.1 million, respectively, of outstanding borrowings, with no assets pledged as support as of december 31, 2016. during the first quarter of 2016, we extended or renewed $869.0 million of our revolving credit facilities. the facilities and their new maturity dates include a $400.0 million 5-year facility with pfg, pfs and principal life as co-borrowers, of which $20.0 million matures march 2020 and $380.0 million matures march 2021, a $300.0 million 364-day facility with principal life as borrower that matures march 2017 and a $200.0 million 5-year credit

facility, with pfg, pfs, principal life and principal financial services v (uk) ltd as co-borrowers, of which $11.0 million matures march 2020 and $189.0 million matures march 2021. the revolving credit facilities are committed and provide 100% back-stop support for our commercial paper program. the $400.0 million facility is supported by sixteen banks through march 2020, reduced to $380.0 million supported by fifteen banks thereafter; the $300.0 million facility is supported by fifteen banks and the $200.0 million facility is supported by fifteen banks through march 2020, reduced to $189.0 million supported by fourteen banks thereafter. most of the banks have other relationships with us. in addition to the revolving credit facilities, principal international chile has the capacity to access up to $60.0 million in unsecured lines of credit offered by chilean financial institutions and principal life has a $45.0 million unsecured line of credit. due to the financial strength and the strong relationships we have with these providers, we are comfortable we have very low risk the financial institutions would be unable or unwilling to fund these facilities.
the holding companies: principal financial group, inc. and principal financial services, inc.    the principal sources of funds available to our parent holding company, pfg, to meet its obligations, including the payments of dividends on common stock, debt service and the repurchase of stock, are dividends from subsidiaries as well as its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise capital to meet operating and growth needs. the declaration and payment of common stock dividends by us is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our overall financial condition, results of operations, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects, receipt of dividends from principal life (as described below), risk management considerations and other factors deemed relevant by the board. no significant restrictions limit the payment of dividends by pfg, except those generally applicable to corporations incorporated in delaware. dividends from principal life, our primary subsidiary, are limited by iowa law.
under iowa law, principal life may pay dividends only from the earned surplus arising from its business and must receive the prior approval of the insurance commissioner of the state of iowa ("the commissioner") to pay stockholder dividends or make any other distribution if such distributions would exceed certain statutory limitations. iowa law gives the commissioner discretion to disapprove requests for distributions in excess of these limits. extraordinary dividends include those made within the preceding twelve months that exceed the greater of (i) 10% of principal life's statutory policyholder surplus as of the previous year-end or (ii) the statutory net gain from operations from the previous calendar year. based on statutory results for the year ended december 31, 2016, the dividend limitation for principal life is approximately $1,143.3 million in 2017.
in 2016, total stockholder dividends paid by principal life to its parent were $1,175.0 million, of which $650.0 million was extraordinary and approved by the commissioner. as of december 31, 2016, we had $1,309.8 million of cash and liquid assets held in our holding companies and other subsidiaries, which is available for corporate purposes. corporate balances held in foreign holding companies meet the indefinite reinvestment exception (see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 10, income taxes") such that deferred income taxes are not provided as the accumulated earnings would be used offshore and not otherwise repatriated to the u.s.
in 2015, total stockholder dividends paid by principal life to its parent were $504.4 million, all of which were extraordinary and approved by the commissioner.
in 2014, total stockholder dividends paid by principal life to its parent were $850.0 million, of which $400.0 million was extraordinary and was approved by the commissioner.
operations.    our primary consolidated cash flow sources are premiums from insurance products, pension and annuity deposits, asset management fee revenues, administrative services fee revenues, income from investments and proceeds from the sales or maturity of investments. cash outflows consist primarily of payment of benefits to policyholders and beneficiaries, income and other taxes, current operating expenses, payment of dividends to policyholders, payments in connection with investments acquired, payments made to acquire subsidiaries, payments relating to policy and contract surrenders, withdrawals, policy loans, interest payments and repayment of short-term debt and long-term debt. our investment strategies are generally intended to provide adequate funds to pay benefits without forced sales of investments. for a discussion of our investment objectives and strategies, see "investments."
cash flows.    activity, as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, provides relevant information regarding our sources and uses of cash. the following discussion of our operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows excludes cash flows attributable to the separate accounts.
net cash provided by operating activities was $3,857.8 million, $4,377.1 million and $3,102.9 for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. our insurance business typically generates positive cash flows from operating activities, as premiums collected from our insurance products and income received from our investments exceed acquisition costs, benefits paid, redemptions and operating expenses. these positive cash flows are then invested to support the obligations of our insurance and investment products and required capital supporting these products. our cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of premiums, fees and investment income received and benefits and expenses paid. the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was the result of fluctuations in receivables and payables associated with the timing of settlements. the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to growth in the business including higher sales of single premium group annuities and individual annuities with life contingencies.
54
net cash used in investing activities was $5,153.9 million, $3,167.6 million and $1,172.7 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was the result of increased purchases of available-for-sale securities primarily in the spread businesses. cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 increased due to higher net purchases of fixed maturity securities and the acquisition of axa's mpf and orso pension business in hong kong in 2015.
net cash provided by financing activities was $1,450.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $508.6 million and $2,438.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase in cash provided by financing activities was the result of net investment contract deposits in 2016 as compared to net investment contract withdrawals in 2015 primarily due to new issuances in the investment only business in 2016. the increase was partially offset by the net redemption of long-term debt in 2016 as compared to the net issuance of long-term debt in 2015. the decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was the result of decreased net withdrawals of investment contracts and the issuance of long-term debt in 2015. the proceeds of the debt issuance were primarily used for the redemption of preferred stock in 2015.
shelf registration.    on may 7, 2014, our shelf registration statement was filed with the sec and became effective. the shelf registration replaced the shelf registration that had been in effect since may 2011. under our current shelf registration, we have the ability to issue, in unlimited amounts, unsecured senior debt securities or subordinated debt securities; junior subordinated debt; preferred stock; common stock; warrants; depository shares; stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units of pfg; trust preferred securities of three subsidiary trusts and guarantees by pfg of these trust preferred securities. our wholly owned subsidiary, pfs, may guarantee, fully and unconditionally or otherwise, our obligations with respect to any non-convertible securities, other than common stock, described in the shelf registration. for information on senior notes issued from our shelf registration, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 9, debt."
short-term debt.    for short-term debt information, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 9, debt."
long-term debt.    on november 10, 2016, we issued $650.0 million of senior notes, in two tranches. the proceeds from the issuance of these notes were used to redeem our notes payable due in 2017 and 2019. on november 18 and december 5, 2016, we used available cash to purchase approximately $94.4 million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due in 2036. on may 7, 2015, we issued $400.0 million of senior notes and $400.0 million of junior subordinated notes, which are subordinated to all our senior debt. the proceeds from these notes were used primarily to redeem our series a and series b preferred stock. for additional long-term debt information regarding these debt issuances, purchases and redemptions, and all outstanding long-term debt, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 9, debt."
stockholders' equity.    on june 30, 2015, we redeemed our 3.0 million shares of series a preferred stock for $300.0 million and our 10.0 million shares of series b preferred stock for $250.0 million. proceeds from the issuance of our common stock were $37.8 million, $76.1 million and $77.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

contractual obligations exclude short-term liabilities, other policyholder funds, taxes and short-term debt as these are not long-term and/or not contractual in nature. contractual obligations also exclude obligations under our pension and opeb plans as we do not anticipate contributions will be needed to satisfy the minimum funding requirements of erisa for our qualified pension plan. in addition, separate account liabilities are excluded. separate account liabilities represent the fair market value of the assets of the funds that are separately administered by us. generally, the separate account contract owner, rather than us, bears the investment risk of these funds. the separate account liabilities are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of any other business of ours. net deposits, net investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on the separate accounts are not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. the separate account obligations will be fully funded by cash flows from the separate account assets.
(2)
contractholder funds include gics, funding agreements, individual fixed annuities, universal life insurance and other investment contracts. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 8, insurance liabilities" for additional information.
amounts included in the contractholder funds line item reflect estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders. the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount included in our consolidated statements of financial position as of december 31, 2016. the liability amount in our consolidated statements of financial position reflects either the account value (in the case of individual fixed annuities, universal life insurance and gics) or the par value plus accrued interest and other adjustments (in the case of funding agreements and other investment contracts).
(3)
amounts included in the future policy benefits and claims line item reflect estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders. the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount included in our consolidated statements of financial position as of december 31, 2016. the liability amount in our consolidated statements of financial position reflects estimated cash payments to policyholders, reductions for expected future premiums, assumptions with regard to the timing of cash payments and discounting for interest.
(4)
for long-term debt information, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 9, debt."
(5)
amounts included in the certificates of deposit line item reflect estimated cash payments to be made, including expected interest payments. certificates of deposit are reported with other liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position.

(6)
amounts included in the other long-term liabilities line item are contractual, non-cancelable and long-term in nature. the total payments primarily relate to savings deposits as well as premium associated with purchased option contracts where payments are made over the life of the contract. this line item excludes accruals, short-term items and items not contractual in nature.
(7)
amounts included in the capital leases line item represent future minimum lease payments due under capital leases for buildings and hardware storage equipment. for capital lease information, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 12, contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications" under the caption, "capital leases."
(8)
amounts included in the operating leases line item represent payments due under various operating leases for office space, data processing equipment and office furniture and equipment. for operating lease information, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 12, contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications" under the caption, "operating leases."
(9)
purchase obligations include material contracts where we have a non-cancelable commitment to purchase goods and services in addition to commitments to originate loans and purchase investments.
pension and opeb plan funding we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our u.s. employees and certain agents. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, employee and agent benefits" for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements.
we report the net funded status of our pension and opeb plans in the consolidated statements of financial position. the net funded status represents the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation for pension and opeb plans. the measurement of the net funded status can vary based upon the fluctuations in the fair value of the plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for the plans as discussed below. the net underfunded status of the pension and opeb obligation was $346.6 million pre-tax and $424.6 million pre-tax as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. nonqualified pension plan assets are not included as part of the funding status mentioned above. the nonqualified pension plan assets are held in rabbi trusts for the benefit of all nonqualified plan participants. the assets held in a rabbi trust are available to satisfy the claims of general creditors only in the event of bankruptcy. therefore, these assets are fully consolidated in our consolidated statements of financial position and are not reflected in our funded status as they do not qualify as plan assets under u.s. gaap. the market value of assets held in these trusts was $341.0 million and $330.8 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
our funding policy for the qualified pension plan is to fund the plan annually in an amount at least equal to the minimum annual contributions required under erisa and, generally, not greater than the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. we do not anticipate contributions will be needed to satisfy the minimum funding requirements of erisa for our qualified pension plan. we are unable to estimate the amount that may be contributed, but it is possible that we may fund the plans in 2017 up to $125 million. this includes funding for both our qualified and nonqualified pension plans. we may contribute to our opeb plans in 2017 pending further analysis.
contractual commitments in connection with our banking business, we have made commitments to extend credit under home equity lines of credit, which are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any conditions established in the contract. commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. a majority of these lines of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon. therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash funding requirements. we evaluate each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. the total commitments to fund home equity loans were $3.4 million as of december 31, 2016.
we have made commitments to provide liquidity for certain benefit plans transitioning to us from another provider. as funds from the plans become available, they will be used to pay down outstanding balances. as of december 31, 2016, the amount of unfunded commitments was $17.0 million.
we have made commitments to fund certain limited partnerships and other funds interests in which we are not the general partner or investment manager. as of december 31, 2016, the amount of unfunded commitments was $658.1 million. we are only required to fund additional equity under these commitments when called upon to do so by the partnership or fund; therefore, these commitments are not liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position.
off-balance sheet arrangements variable interest entities.    we have relationships with various types of special purpose entities and other entities where we have a variable interest as described in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 3, variable interest entities." we have made commitments to fund certain limited partnerships, as previously discussed in "contractual commitments", some of which are classified as unconsolidated variable interest entities.
guarantees and indemnifications.    as of december 31, 2016, no significant changes to guarantees and indemnifications have occurred since december 31, 2015. for guarantee and indemnification information, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 12, contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications" under the caption, "guarantees and indemnifications."

financial strength and credit ratings our ratings are influenced by the relative ratings of our peers/competitors as well as many other factors including our operating and financial performance, capital levels, asset quality, liquidity, asset/liability management, overall portfolio mix, financial leverage (i.e., debt), risk exposures, operating leverage and other factors.
in january 2017, a.m. best affirmed the financial strength ratings of principal life and pnlic at 'a+'. the outlook remains 'stable' for all ratings. the affirmation reflects continued solid risk-adjusted capitalization, well-managed balance sheet, strong business profile and consistently favorable operating results.
in november 2016, moody's affirmed the financial strength ratings of principal life and pnlic at 'a1'. the outlook remains 'stable'. the affirmation is based on the leading, broad-based position of principal life in the u.s. group pension market, with earnings diversification from retail life and annuity businesses.
in october 2016, fitch affirmed the financial strength ratings of principal life and pnlic at 'aa'. the outlook remains 'stable'. the affirmation reflects pfg's strong capitalization and stable, balanced operating profitability, partially offset by above-average exposure to direct mortgages, structured mortgage securities and direct real estate investments.
in april 2016, s&p affirmed pfg's credit ratings and the financial strength ratings of principal life and pnlic at 'a+'. the outlook remains 'stable' for all ratings. principal life's enterprise risk management rating was affirmed as 'strong'. the rating affirmation reflects s&p's view that we are a leading competitor in the u.s. small to midsize 401(k) market, with strong asset management and insurance solution capabilities, strong competitive position supported by respected brand, diversified and sophisticated product portfolio and positive operating performance.
a.m. best, moody's and fitch have changed their outlook on the u.s. life insurance sector to 'negative' from 'stable'. continued low interest rates, an uncertain regulatory environment, exposure to asset management and international risks and low domestic growth are pressuring the sector. s&p maintains a 'stable' outlook on the u.s. life insurance sector. s&p's view is that insurers have strong levels of capital that will offset credit quality impacts from the interest rate environment. any deterioration in capitalization will not be to a level that will impact near-term ratings.
the following table summarizes our significant financial strength and debt ratings from the major independent rating organizations. the debt ratings shown are indicative ratings. outstanding issuances are rated the same as indicative ratings unless otherwise noted. actual ratings can differ from indicative ratings based on contractual terms. a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. such a rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

fair value measurement fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority (level 1) to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and gives the lowest priority (level 3) to unobservable inputs. the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety considering factors specific to the asset or liability. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 14, fair value measurements" for further details, including a reconciliation of changes in level 3 fair value measurements.

as of december 31, 2016, 41% of our net assets (liabilities) were level 1, 55% were level 2 and 4% were level 3. excluding separate account assets as of december 31, 2016, 3% of our net assets (liabilities) were level 1, 96% were level 2 and 1% were level 3.
as of december 31, 2015, 39% of our net assets (liabilities) were level 1, 57% were level 2 and 4% were level 3. excluding separate account assets as of december 31, 2015, 4% of our net assets (liabilities) were level 1, 95% were level 2 and 1% were level 3.
changes in level 3 fair value measurements net assets (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (level 3) as of december 31, 2016, were $7,779.6 million as compared to $7,318.6 million as of december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily related to gains on other invested assets and real estate included in our separate account assets and net purchases of certain structured securities. the increase was partially offset by net sales in our separate accounts assets.
net assets (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (level 3) as of december 31, 2015, were $7,318.6 million as compared to $6,350.1 million as of december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily related to gains on other invested assets and real estate included in our separate account assets.
investments we had total consolidated assets as of december 31, 2016, of $228,014.3 million, of which $75,835.5 million were invested assets. the rest of our total consolidated assets are comprised primarily of separate account assets for which we do not bear investment risk; therefore, the discussion and financial information below does not include such assets.
overall composition of invested assets invested assets as of december 31, 2016, were predominantly high quality and broadly diversified across asset class, individual credit, industry and geographic location. asset allocation is determined based on cash flow and the risk/return requirements of our products. as shown in the following table, the major categories of invested assets are fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans. the remainder is invested in other investments, equity securities, real estate and residential mortgage loans. in addition, policy loans are included in our invested assets.

year ended december 31, 2016 compared to year ended december 31, 2015
net investment income increased primarily due to higher average invested assets in our u.s. operations and an increase in variable investment income primarily related to the sale of joint venture real estate and certain other real estate. these increases were partially offset by lower investment yields on invested assets in our u.s. operations.
year ended december 31, 2015 compared to year ended december 31, 2014
net investment income decreased primarily due to lower investment yields and prepayments on invested assets and cash in our u.s. operations. in addition, net investment income decreased due to the weakening of the latin american currencies against the u.s. dollar, lower inflation-based investment returns on average invested assets and cash as a result of lower inflation in chile and unfavorable relative market performance on our required regulatory investment in the pension funds of our chilean pension company.

includes credit impairments as well as losses on sales of fixed maturities to reduce credit risk, net of realized credit recoveries on the sale of previously impaired securities. credit gains on sales, excluding associated foreign currency fluctuations that are included in derivatives and related hedging activities, were a net gain of $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.9 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to year ended december 31, 2015
net realized capital losses on fixed maturities, available-for-sale  credit impairments increased primarily due to higher impairments on corporate fixed maturities in the energy sector and structured fixed maturities.
net realized capital gains on fixed maturities, available-for-sale and trading  noncredit increased primarily due to the sale of a long dated structured security in 2016 and gains versus losses on trading securities related to changes in interest rates and credit spreads.
derivatives and related hedge activities had net gains in 2016 as compared to net losses in 2015 primarily due to increased gains on interest rate swap derivatives not designated as hedging instruments due to changes in interest rates. in addition, currency forwards and currency swaps had gains in 2016 versus losses in 2015 due to changes in exchange rates and on credit related derivatives.
60
other gains (losses) reflected gains in 2016 as compared to losses in 2015 primarily due to a write-off of unamortized book value on corporate owned real estate in 2015 and gains in 2016 versus losses in 2015 on equity securities, trading.
year ended december 31, 2015 compared to year ended december 31, 2014
net realized capital losses on fixed maturities, available-for-sale  credit impairments decreased primarily due to decreased losses on structured fixed maturities as a result of improved market conditions. this was partially offset by losses versus gains on corporate fixed maturities.
net realized capital gains on fixed maturities, available-for-sale and trading  noncredit decreased primarily due to losses versus gains on trading securities related to changes in interest rates and credit spreads and a gain from the sale of a long dated structured security in 2014.
net realized capital losses on derivatives and related hedge activities increased primarily due to losses versus gains on the gmwb embedded derivative, including changes in the spread reflecting our own creditworthiness, and related hedging instruments. this was partially offset by decreased losses on credit related derivatives.
other gains (losses) reflected losses in 2015 as compared to gains in 2014 primarily due to decreased gains on sales of real estate investments and joint venture real estate and a write-off of unamortized book value on corporate owned real estate in 2015. this was partially offset by an impairment of liongate, an equity method investment, in 2014.
u.s. investment operations of our invested assets, $68,808.2 million were held by our u.s. operations as of december 31, 2016. our u.s. invested assets are managed primarily by our principal global investors segment. our primary investment objective is to maximize after-tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters. we seek to protect policyholders' benefits by optimizing the risk/return relationship on an ongoing basis, through asset/liability matching, reducing the credit risk, avoiding high levels of investments that may be redeemed by the issuer, maintaining sufficiently liquid investments and avoiding undue asset concentrations through diversification. we are exposed to two primary sources of investment risk:
 credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of an obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest and
 interest rate risk, relating to the market price and/or cash flow variability associated with changes in market yield curves.
our ability to manage credit risk is essential to our business and our profitability. we devote considerable resources to the credit analysis of each new investment. we manage credit risk through industry, issuer and asset class diversification. our investment committee, appointed by our board of directors, is responsible for establishing all investment policies and approving or authorizing all investments, except the executive committee of the board must approve any investment transaction exceeding $500.0 million. as of december 31, 2016, eleven members served on the investment committee, one of whom is a member of our board of directors. the remaining members were senior management members representing various areas of our company.
we purchase credit default swaps to hedge certain credit exposures in our investment portfolio and total return swaps and futures to hedge a portion of our investment portfolio from credit losses. we economically hedged credit exposure in our portfolio by purchasing credit default swaps with a notional amount of $176.5 million and $213.2 million, total return swaps with a notional of $90.0 million and $90.0 million, and futures with a notional of $11.9 million and $13.1 million as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively. we sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to investors when entering into synthetic replicating transactions. when selling credit protection, if there is an event of default by the referenced name, we are obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the referenced security. for further information on credit derivatives sold, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 5, derivative financial instruments" under the caption, "credit derivatives sold."
we also seek to manage call or prepayment risk arising from changes in interest rates. we assess and price for call or prepayment risks in all of our investments and monitor these risks in accordance with asset/liability management policies.
the amortized cost and weighted average yield, calculated using amortized cost, of non-structured fixed maturity securities that will be callable at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $2,075.9 million and 3.5%, respectively, as of december 31, 2016 and $1,554.9 million and 3.9%, respectively, as of december 31, 2015. in addition, the amortized cost and weighted average yield of residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities, residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and asset-backed securities  home equity with material prepayment risk were $4,891.3 million and 3.2%, respectively, as of december 31, 2016 and $4,391.9 million and 3.3%, respectively, as of december 31, 2015.
our fixed income securities committee, consisting of fixed income securities senior management members, approves the credit rating for the fixed maturities we purchase. teams of security analysts, organized by industry, analyze and monitor these investments. in addition, we have teams who specialize in rmbs, cmbs, abs, municipals and below investment grade securities. our analysts monitor issuers held in the portfolio on a continuous basis with a formal review documented annually or more frequently if material events affect the issuer. the analysis includes both fundamental and
61
technical factors. the fundamental analysis encompasses both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the issuer. the qualitative analysis includes an assessment of both accounting and management aggressiveness of the issuer. in addition, technical indicators such as stock price volatility and credit default swap levels are monitored.
our fixed income securities committee also reviews private transactions on a continuous basis to assess the quality ratings of our privately placed investments. we regularly review our investments to determine whether we should re-rate them, employing the following criteria:
 material changes in the issuer's revenues or margins;
 significant management or organizational changes;
 significant changes regarding the issuer's industry;
 debt service coverage or cash flow ratios that fall below industry-specific thresholds;
 violation of financial covenants and
 other business factors that relate to the issuer.
our use of derivatives exposes us to counterparty risk, or the risk that the counterparty fails to perform the terms of the derivative contract. we actively manage this risk by:
 obtaining approval of all new counterparties by the investment committee;
 establishing exposure limits that take into account non-derivative exposure we have with the counterparty as well as derivative exposure;
 performing similar credit analysis prior to approval on each derivatives counterparty that we do when lending money on a long-term basis;
 diversifying our risk across numerous approved counterparties;
 implementing credit support annex (collateral) agreements ("csas") for over-the-counter derivative transactions or similar agreements with a majority of our counterparties to further limit counterparty exposures, which provide for netting of exposures;
 limiting exposure to a credit or better for over-the-counter derivative counterparties without csas;
 conducting stress-test analysis to determine the maximum exposure created during the life of a prospective transaction;
 daily monitoring of counterparty credit ratings, exposures and associated collateral levels and
 trading mandatorily cleared contracts through centralized clearinghouses.
we manage our exposure on a net basis, whereby we net positive and negative exposures for each counterparty with agreements in place. for further information on derivative exposure, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, investments" under the caption, "balance sheet offsetting."
a dedicated risk management team is responsible for centralized monitoring of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio. we apply a variety of strategies to minimize credit risk in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. when considering new commercial mortgage loans, we review the cash flow fundamentals of the property, make a physical assessment of the underlying security, conduct a comprehensive market analysis and compare against industry lending practices. we use a proprietary risk rating model to evaluate all new and substantially all existing loans within the portfolio. the proprietary risk model is designed to stress projected cash flows under simulated economic and market downturns. our lending guidelines are typically 75% or less loan-to-value ratio and a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2 times. we analyze investments outside of these guidelines based on cash flow quality, tenancy and other factors. the following table presents loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios for our brick and mortar commercial mortgages, excluding principal global investors segment mortgages:

new mortgages               52      %   50      %   2.6x   3.1x entire mortgage portfolio   46      %   46      %   2.7x   2.7x our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each primary business operation. in addition, we diversify our product portfolio offerings to include products that contain features that will protect us against fluctuations in interest rates. those features include adjustable crediting rates, policy surrender charges and market value adjustments on liquidations. for further information on our management of interest rate risk, see item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  interest rate risk."

we believe it is desirable to hold residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities due to their credit quality and liquidity as well as portfolio diversification characteristics. our portfolio is comprised of government national mortgage association, federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation pass-through securities. in addition, our residential collateralized mortgage obligation portfolio offers structural features that allow cash flows to be matched to our liabilities.
cmbs provide varying levels of credit protection, diversification and reduced event risk depending on the securities owned and composition of the loan pool. cmbs are predominantly comprised of large pool securitizations that are diverse by property type, borrower and geographic dispersion. the risks to any cmbs deal are determined by the credit quality of the underlying loans and how those loans perform over time. another key risk is the vintage of the underlying loans and the state of the markets during a particular vintage. in the cmbs market, there is a material difference in the outlook for the performance of loans originated in 2004 and earlier relative to loans originated in 2005 through 2008. for loans originated prior to 2005, underwriting assumptions were more conservative regarding required debt service coverage and loan-to-value ratios. for the 2005 through 2008 vintages, real estate values peaked and the underwriting expectations were that values would continue to increase, which makes those loan values more sensitive to market declines. the 2009 through 2016 vintages represent a return to debt service coverage ratios and loan-to-value ratios that more closely resemble loans originated prior to 2005.
we purchase abs to diversify the overall credit risks of the fixed maturities portfolio and to provide attractive returns. the principal risks in holding abs are structural and credit risks. structural risks include the security's priority in
63
the issuer's capital structure, the adequacy of and ability to realize proceeds from the collateral and the potential for prepayments. credit risks involve collateral and issuer/servicer risk where collateral and servicer performance may deteriorate. our abs portfolio is diversified both by type of asset and by issuer. we actively monitor holdings of abs to recognize adverse changes in the risk profile of each security. prepayments in the abs portfolio are, in general, insensitive to changes in interest rates or are insulated from such changes by call protection features. in the event we are subject to prepayment risk, we monitor the factors that impact the level of prepayment and prepayment speed for those abs. in addition, we hold a diverse class of securities, which limits our exposure to any one security.
the international exposure held in our u.s. operation's fixed maturities portfolio was 21% of total fixed maturities as of december 31, 2016 and 22% as of december 31, 2015. it is comprised of corporate and foreign government fixed maturities. the following table presents the carrying amount of our international exposure for our u.s. operation's fixed maturities portfolio for the years indicated.

includes exposure from two countries and various supranational organizations as of both december 31, 2016, and december 31, 2015.
international fixed maturities exposure is determined by the country of domicile of the parent entity of an individual asset. all international fixed maturities held by our u.s. operations are either denominated in u.s. dollars or have been swapped into u.s. dollar equivalents. our international investments are analyzed internally by country and industry credit investment professionals. we control concentrations using issuer and country level exposure benchmarks, which are based on the credit quality of the issuer and the country. our investment policy limits total international fixed maturities investments and we are within those internal limits. exposure to canada is not included in our international exposure. as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, our investments in canada totaled $1,604.5 million and $1,310.5 million, respectively.
fixed maturities credit concentrations.    one aspect of managing credit risk is through industry, issuer and asset class diversification. our credit concentrations are managed to established limits. the following table presents our top ten exposures as of december 31, 2016.

fixed maturities valuation and credit quality.    valuation techniques for the fixed maturities portfolio vary by security type and the availability of market data. the use of different pricing techniques and their assumptions could produce different financial results. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 14, fair value measurements" for further details regarding our pricing methodology. once prices are determined, they are reviewed by pricing analysts for reasonableness based on asset class and observable market data. investment analysts who are familiar with specific securities review prices for reasonableness through direct interaction with external sources, review of recent trade activity or use of internal models. all fixed maturities placed on the "watch list" are periodically analyzed by investment analysts or analysts that focus on troubled securities ("workout group"). this group then meets with the chief investment officer and the portfolio managers to determine reasonableness of prices. the valuation of impaired bonds for which there is no quoted price is typically based on the present value of the future cash flows expected to be received. although we believe these values reasonably reflect the fair value of those securities, the key assumptions about risk premiums, performance of underlying collateral (if any) and other market factors involve qualitative and unobservable inputs.

the securities valuation office ("svo") of the naic monitors the bond investments of insurers for regulatory capital and reporting purposes and, when required, assigns securities to one of six categories referred to as naic designations. although naic designations are not produced to aid the investment decision making process, naic designations may serve as a reasonable proxy for nationally recognized statistical rating organizations' ("nrsro") credit ratings for certain bonds. for most corporate bonds, naic designations 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade by such rating organizations. bonds are considered investment grade when rated "baa3" or higher by moody's, or "bbb" or higher by s&p. naic designations 3 through 6 include bonds generally referred to as below investment grade. bonds are considered below investment grade when rated "ba1" or lower by moody's, or "bb+" or lower by s&p.
however, for loan-backed and structured securities, as defined by the naic, the naic designation is not always a reasonable indication of an nrsro rating as described below. for cmbs and non-agency rmbs, blackrock solutions undertakes the modeling of those naic designations. other loan-backed and structured securities may be subject to an intrinsic price matrix as provided by the naic. this may result in a final designation being higher or lower than the nrsro credit rating.
the following table presents our total fixed maturities by naic designation as of the years indicated as well as the percentage, based on fair value, that each designation comprises.

fixed maturities watch list.    we monitor any decline in the credit quality of fixed maturities through the designation of "problem securities," "potential problem securities" and "restructured securities". we define problem securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities: (i) with principal and/or interest payments in default or where default is perceived to be imminent in the near term, or (ii) issued by a company that went into bankruptcy subsequent to the acquisition of such securities. we define potential problem securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities included on an internal "watch list" for which management has concerns as to the ability of the issuer to comply with the present debt payment terms and which may result in the security becoming a problem or being restructured. the decision whether to classify a performing fixed maturity security as a potential problem involves significant subjective judgments by our management as to the likely future industry conditions and developments with respect to the issuer. we define restructured securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities where a concession has been granted to the borrower related to the borrower's financial difficulties that would not have otherwise been considered. we determine that restructures should occur in those instances where greater economic value will be realized under the new terms than through liquidation or other disposition and may involve a change in contractual cash flows. if the present value of the restructured cash flows is less than the current cost of the asset being restructured, a realized capital loss is recorded in net income and a new cost basis is established.
the following table presents the total carrying amount of our fixed maturities portfolio, as well as its problem, potential problem and restructured fixed maturities for the years indicated.

fixed maturities impairments.    we have a process in place to identify securities that could potentially have a credit impairment that is other than temporary. this process involves monitoring market events that could impact issuers' credit ratings, business climate, management changes, litigation and government actions and other similar factors. this process also involves monitoring late payments, pricing levels, downgrades by rating agencies, key financial ratios, financial statements, revenue forecasts and cash flow projections as indicators of credit issues.
each reporting period, a group of individuals including the chief investment officer, our portfolio managers, members of our workout group and representatives from investment accounting review all securities to determine whether an other-than-temporary decline in value exists and whether losses should be recognized. the analysis focuses on each issuer's ability to service its debts in a timely fashion. formal documentation of the analysis and our decision is prepared and approved by management.
we consider relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether a credit or interest rate- related impairment of a security is other than temporary. relevant facts and circumstances considered include: (1) the extent and length of time the fair value has been below cost; (2) the reasons for the decline in value; (3) the financial position and access to capital of the issuer, including the current and future impact of any specific events; (4) for structured securities, the adequacy of the expected cash flows and (5) our intent to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost which, in some cases, may extend to maturity. to the extent we determine a security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired, an impairment loss is recognized. for additional details, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, investments."

we would not consider a security with unrealized losses to be other than temporarily impaired when it is not our intent to sell the security, it is not more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost, which may be maturity, and we expect to recover the amortized cost basis. however, we do sell securities under certain circumstances, such as when we have evidence of a change in the issuer's creditworthiness, when we anticipate poor relative future performance of securities, when a change in regulatory requirements modifies what constitutes a permissible investment or the maximum level of investments held or when there is an increase in capital requirements or a change in risk weights of debt securities. sales generate both gains and losses.
a number of significant risks and uncertainties are inherent in the process of monitoring credit impairments and determining if an impairment is other than temporary. these risks and uncertainties include: (1) the risk that our assessment of an issuer's ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that issuer, (2) the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated, (3) the risk that our investment professionals are making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers and (4) the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and circumstances lead us to change our intent to not sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost. any of these situations could result in a charge to net income in a future period.
the net realized loss relating to other-than-temporary credit impairments and credit related sales of fixed maturities was $95.1 million, $30.3 million, and $83.7 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

of the $615.6 million in gross unrealized losses as of december 31, 2016, $17.7 million in losses were attributed to securities scheduled to mature in one year or less, $29.4 million attributed to securities scheduled to mature between one to five years, $74.0 million attributed to securities scheduled to mature between five to ten years, $302.9 million attributed to securities scheduled to mature after ten years and $191.6 million related to mortgage-backed and other abs that are not classified by maturity year. as of december 31, 2016, we were in a $1,328.0 million net unrealized gain position as compared to a $1,070.6 million net unrealized gain position as of december 31, 2015. the $257.4 million increase in net unrealized gains for the year ended december 31, 2016, can primarily be attributed to tightening of credit spreads, partially offset by an approximate 9 basis point increase in interest rates.
fixed maturities available-for-sale unrealized losses.    we believe our long-term fixed maturities portfolio is well diversified among industry types and between publicly traded and privately placed securities. each year, we direct the majority of our net cash inflows into investment grade fixed maturities. our current policy is to limit the percentage of cash flow invested in below investment grade assets to 10% of cash flow.
we invest in privately placed fixed maturities to enhance the overall value of the portfolio, increase diversification and obtain higher yields than are possible with comparable quality public market securities. generally, private placements provide broader access to management information, strengthened negotiated protective covenants, call protection features and, where applicable, a higher level of collateral. they are, however, generally not freely tradable because of restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws and illiquid trading markets.

mortgage loans mortgage loans consist of commercial mortgage loans on real estate and residential mortgage loans. the carrying amount of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio was $11,940.5 million and $11,194.9 million as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively. the carrying amount of our residential mortgage loan portfolio was $680.5 million and $596.1 million as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively.
commercial mortgage loans.    we generally report commercial mortgage loans on real estate at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method and net of valuation allowances.
commercial mortgage loans play an important role in our investment strategy by:
 providing strong risk-adjusted relative value in comparison to other investment alternatives;
 enhancing total returns and
 providing strategic portfolio diversification.
as a result, we have focused on constructing a high quality portfolio of mortgages. our portfolio is generally comprised of mortgages originated with conservative loan-to-value ratios, high debt service coverages and general purpose property types with a strong credit tenancy.
our commercial mortgage loan portfolio consists primarily of non-recourse, fixed rate mortgages on fully or near fully leased properties. the mortgage portfolio is comprised primarily of office properties, apartments, well anchored retail properties and general-purpose industrial properties.
our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is diversified by geography and specific collateral property type. commercial mortgage lending in the state of california accounted for 18% of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio before valuation allowance as of both december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015. we are, therefore, exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, that may affect the region. like other lenders, we generally do not require earthquake insurance for properties on which we make commercial mortgage loans. with respect to california properties, however, we obtain an engineering report specific to each property. the report assesses the building's design specifications, whether it has been upgraded to meet seismic building codes and the maximum loss that is likely to result from a variety of different seismic events. we also obtain a report that assesses, by building and geographic fault lines, the amount of loss our commercial mortgage loan portfolio might suffer under a variety of seismic events.
the typical borrower in our commercial loan portfolio is a single purpose entity or single asset entity. as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, the total number of commercial mortgage loans outstanding was 840 and 878, of which 55% and 60% were for loans with principal balances less than $10.0 million, respectively. the average loan size of our commercial mortgage portfolio was $14.2 million and $12.8 million as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively.
commercial mortgage loan credit monitoring.    for further details on monitoring and management of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, investments  mortgage loan credit monitoring."
we categorize loans that are 60 days or more delinquent, loans in process of foreclosure and loans with borrowers or credit tenants in bankruptcy that are delinquent as "problem" loans. valuation allowances or charge-offs have been recognized on most problem loans. we categorize loans that are delinquent less than 60 days where the default is expected to be cured and loans with borrowers or credit tenants in bankruptcy that are current as "potential problem" loans. the decision whether to classify a loan delinquent less than 60 days as a potential problem involves significant subjective judgments by management as to the likely future economic conditions and developments with respect to the borrower. we categorize loans for which the original note rate has been reduced below market and loans for which the principal has been reduced as "restructured" loans. we also consider loans that are refinanced more than one year beyond the original maturity or call date at below market rates as restructured.

commercial mortgage loan valuation allowance.    the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage loans includes loan specific reserves for loans that are deemed to be impaired as well as reserves for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property risk or market specific risk has not been identified but for which we anticipate a loss may occur. for further details on the commercial mortgage loan valuation allowance, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, investments  mortgage loan valuation allowance."

residential mortgage loans.    the residential mortgage loan portfolio is composed of home equity mortgages with an amortized cost of $165.6 million and $218.8 million and first lien mortgages with an amortized cost of $531.9 million and $401.2 million as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively. the home equity loans are generally second lien mortgages made up of closed-end loans and lines of credit. non-performing residential mortgage loans, which are defined as loans 90 days or greater delinquent plus non-accrual loans, totaled $12.2 million and $16.0 million as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively.
we establish the residential mortgage loan valuation allowance at levels considered adequate to absorb estimated probable losses within the portfolio based on management's evaluation of the size and current risk characteristics of the portfolio. such evaluation considers numerous factors, including, but not limited to net charge-off trends, loss forecasts, collateral values, geographic location, borrower credit scores, delinquency rates, industry condition and economic trends. the changes in the valuation allowance are reported in net realized capital gains (losses) on our consolidated statements of operations.
our residential mortgage loan portfolio, and in particular our home equity loan portfolio, experienced an increase in loss severity from sustained elevated levels of unemployment along with continued depressed collateral values beginning in 2010. while these factors continue to drive charge-offs, loss rates overall have stabilized and the home equity loan portfolio balance continues to decline. the following table represents our residential mortgage loan valuation allowance for the years indicated.

real estate real estate consists primarily of commercial equity real estate. as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, the carrying amount of our equity real estate investment was $1,365.2 million, or 2%, and $1,447.2 million, or 2%, of u.s.
73
invested assets, respectively. our commercial equity real estate is held in the form of wholly owned real estate, real estate acquired upon foreclosure of commercial mortgage loans and majority owned interests in real estate joint ventures.
equity real estate is categorized as either "real estate held for investment" or "real estate held for sale." real estate held for investment totaled $1,236.5 million and $1,280.4 million as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively. the carrying value of real estate held for investment is generally adjusted for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. such impairment adjustments are recorded as net realized capital losses in our consolidated results of operations. impairment adjustments recorded for the years ended december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015 were $0.8 million and $2.9 million, respectively.
the carrying amount of real estate held for sale was $128.7 million and $166.8 million as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively. once we identify a real estate property to be sold and it is probable that it will be sold, we classify the property as held for sale. we establish a valuation allowance subject to periodic revisions, if necessary, to adjust the carrying value of the property to reflect the lower of its current carrying value or the fair value, less associated selling costs. the change in valuation allowance for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $4.5 million. there was no change in valuation allowance for the year ended december 31, 2015.
we use research, both internal and external, to recommend appropriate product and geographic allocations and changes to the equity real estate portfolio. we monitor product, geographic and industry diversification separately and together to determine the most appropriate mix.
equity real estate is distributed across geographic regions of the country. as of december 31, 2016, our equity real estate portfolio was concentrated in the pacific (35%), south atlantic (19%), east north central (15%) and west south central (15%) regions of the united states. by property type, we had a concentration in office (45%) and apartments (25%) as of december 31, 2016.
other investments our other investments totaled $2,088.7 million as of december 31, 2016, compared to $1,877.4 million as of december 31, 2015. derivative assets accounted for $871.6 million and $659.6 million in other investments as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively. the remaining invested assets are primarily related to equity method investments, which include real estate properties owned jointly with venture partners and operated by the partners and sponsored investment funds.
international investment operations of our invested assets, $7,027.3 million were held by our principal international segment as of december 31, 2016. the assets are primarily managed by the local principal international affiliate. due to the regulatory constraints in each location, each company maintains its own investment policies. as shown in the following table, the major category of international invested assets is fixed maturities. the following table excludes invested assets of the separate accounts.

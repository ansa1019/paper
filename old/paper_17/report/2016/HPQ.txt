item 1a. risk factors.
the following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. these risk factors may be important for understanding any statement in this form 10-k or elsewhere. the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" of this form 10-k.
because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our results of operations, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.
risks related to our business if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited.
we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business. one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends, such as the declines in the pc market and home printing. a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. our primary competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets; our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models; and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others. a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution. for example, we may fail to develop innovative products and services, maintain the manufacturing quality of our products, manage our distribution network or successfully market new products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
in addition, we are facing a series of significant macroeconomic challenges, including weakness across many geographic regions, particularly in emerging markets and europe, and certain countries and businesses in asia. we may experience delays
11
in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs. in addition, we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with our efforts to address these challenges given the markets in which we compete, the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate, and the ongoing integration of acquired businesses. if we do not succeed in these efforts, or if these efforts are more costly or time-consuming than expected, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business.
we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance.
we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business, and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments. we compete on the basis of our technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service and support and security. if our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully, our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed.
we have a large portfolio of products and must allocate our financial, personnel and other resources across all of our products while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product lines. as a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do, and our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their products.
companies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or may become our competitors in other areas. in addition, companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, which could reduce their business with us. if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
we face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive, while at the same time trying to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin. in addition, competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lower-cost markets in which we compete, or who can obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions, or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply, may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer. our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures.
industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate. additionally, our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers.
because our business model is based on providing innovative and high-quality products, we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors. if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure (apart from research and development expenses) on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures, our gross margin and, therefore, our profitability could be adversely affected. in addition, if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive, or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions, we may lose market share in certain areas, which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects.
even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product, its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete. financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products. for example, growing demand for an increasing array of mobile computing devices has reduced demand for some of our existing hardware products. in addition, refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of our laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with our printing supplies business.
if we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative products and services, our business and financial performance may suffer.
our strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of products and services to meet the demands of a continually changing technological landscape and to offset certain areas of industry decline. to successfully execute this strategy, we must emphasize the aspects of our core business where demand remains strong, identify and capitalize on natural areas of growth, and innovate and develop new products and services that will enable us to expand beyond our existing technology categories. any failure to successfully execute this strategy, including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
12
the process of developing new high-technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share, results of operations and financial condition. for example, to offset industry declines in some of our businesses, we must successfully grow in adjacencies such as copier printers, maintain our strong position in graphics, develop and introduce 3d printers and execute on our strategy to grow commercial mobility by providing specialized products and services to address the needs of our customers. we must make long-term investments, develop or acquire and protect appropriate intellectual property, and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services. any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends, control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance. our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part, including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding and/or personnel.
our industry is subject to rapid and substantial innovation and technological change. even if we successfully develop new products and technologies, future products and technologies may eventually supplant ours if we are unable to keep pace with technological advances and end-user requirements and preferences and timely enhance our existing products and technologies or develop new ones. our competitors may also create products that replace ours. as a result, any of our products and technologies may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical.
after we develop a product, we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins. to accomplish this, we must accurately forecast volumes, mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements, and we may not succeed at doing so within a given product's lifecycle or at all. any delay in the development, production or marketing of a new product, service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market, which could further harm our competitive position.
if we cannot continue to produce quality products and services, our reputation, business and financial performance may suffer.
in the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by third-party contractors or subcontractors or their employees. in order to address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions. however, the products and services that we offer are complex, and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors, particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third-parties. if we are unable to determine the cause or find an appropriate solution to address quality issues with our products, we may delay shipment to customers, which would delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our net revenue, cash flows and profitability. in addition, after products are delivered, quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products. addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, repair, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our financial performance. if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services, our results of operations could be adversely affected, and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers' expectations. in addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation, which could, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations.
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely impact our results.
currencies other than the u.s. dollar, including the euro, the british pound, chinese yuan (renminbi) and the japanese yen, can have an impact on our results as expressed in u.s. dollars. in particular, the economic uncertainties relating to european sovereign and other debt obligations and the related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate. in addition, the united kingdom's june 2016 vote to leave the european union (commonly known as "brexit") caused significant volatility in currency exchange rates, especially between the u.s. dollar and the british pound. global economic events and uncertainty may cause currencies to fluctuate and currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions. for example, in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency, our sales into such countries, or into europe generally, would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established. accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, such as the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro or the british pound or the weakness of the japanese yen, could adversely affect our net revenue growth in future periods. in addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states.
13
from time to time, we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks. the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations. in addition, certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective, may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue, financial condition and, to a lesser extent, our cost of sales.
recent global, regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our business and financial performance.
our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology products and services in the markets in which we compete. recent economic weakness and uncertainty in various markets throughout the world have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased net revenue, gross margin, earnings or growth rates and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels. for example, we are continuing to experience macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions, particularly in the europe, the middle east and africa region, china and certain other high-growth markets. ongoing u.s. federal government spending limits may continue to reduce demand for our products and services from organizations that receive funding from the u.s. government, and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states, which could further reduce demand for our products and services. brexit and the uncertainty surrounding the united kingdom's exit from the european union has also begun to negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions that could continue for the foreseeable future.
economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products and services, may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges, and may make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue, gross margin, cash flows and expenses.
we also have experienced, and may experience in the future, gross margin declines in certain businesses, reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that, as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors, we are unable to pass on to our customers. in addition, our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment, parts or components from our suppliers-and our suppliers from their suppliers-due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit.
economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations. any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations, as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption. poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and post-retirement benefit expenses. interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates, borrowing costs, currency exchange rates, costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments. economic downturns also may lead to future restructuring actions and associated expenses.
the net revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes our future financial results less predictable.
our net revenue, gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services, customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results. our net revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services. delays or reductions in hardware and related services spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services, which could result in a significant decline in net revenue. in addition, net revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect net revenue in our other businesses as we may lose cross-selling opportunities. overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product, service, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period's net revenue. competition, lawsuits, investigations, increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers, component supply disruptions and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability. in addition, newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures, and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets. market trends, industry shifts, competitive pressures, commoditization of products, increased component or shipping costs, regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period, which may lead to adjustments to our operations. moreover, our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of
14
variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period.
if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our business and financial performance could suffer.
we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world, including third-party resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers. successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our net revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability.
our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken. our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space. moreover, some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including economic weakness, industry consolidation and market trends. many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past. considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners. net revenue from indirect sales could suffer, and we could experience disruptions in distribution, if our distributors' financial conditions, abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken.
our inventory management is complex, as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors. we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges. distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products. distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues, and therefore make forecasting more difficult. if we have excess or obsolete inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory. moreover, our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors.
we depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively.
our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components, products and services, as well as our suppliers' ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components, products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services. given the wide variety of systems, products and services that we offer, the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world, and the long lead times required to manufacture, assemble and deliver certain components and products, problems could arise in production, planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business. in addition, our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming and resource intensive than expected. furthermore, certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us. other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages, excess supply, risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers, risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers, each of which is described below.
15
•   component shortages. we may experience a shortage of, or a delay in receiving, certain components as a result of strong demand, capacity constraints, supplier financial weaknesses, the inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets, disputes with suppliers (some of whom are also our customers), disruptions in the operations of component suppliers, other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers. for example, our pc business relies heavily upon oms to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those oms to fulfill demand for our pc products. we represent a substantial portion of the business of some of these oms, and any changes to the nature or volume of our business transactions with a particular om could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the om and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that om. if shortages or delays persist, the price of certain components may increase, we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all. we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications. accordingly, our business and financial performance could suffer if we lose time-sensitive sales, incur additional freight costs or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers. if we cannot adequately address supply issues, we might have to reengineer some product or service offerings, which could result in further costs and delays.
•   excess supply. in order to secure components for our products or services, at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors. in addition, we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components. if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.
•   contractual terms. as a result of binding long-term price or purchase commitments with vendors, we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions. if we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the then-current market price, we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices, our gross margin could suffer, and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence. in addition, many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same oms and suppliers that we utilize. our competitors may obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions, and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply, and our ability to engage in relationships with certain oms and suppliers could be limited. the practice employed by our pc business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to its oms may create large supplier receivables with the oms that, depending on the financial condition of the oms, may create collectability risks. in addition, certain of our oms and suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us. any of these developments could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.
•   contingent workers. we also rely on third-party suppliers for the provision of contingent workers, and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations. we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future. we may be subject to shortages, oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers. our ability to manage the size of, and costs associated with, the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws.
•   single-source suppliers. we obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. for example, we rely on canon for certain laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges. we also rely on intel to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our pcs and workstations, and we rely on amd to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for other products. some of those processors are customized for our products. new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers. replacing a single-source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations. for some components, such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from intel, or the laser printer engines and toner cartridges that we obtain from canon, alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements. in addition, we sometimes purchase components from single-source suppliers under short-term agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty. the performance of such single-source suppliers under those agreements (and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect the quality, quantity and price of our components. the loss of a single-source supplier, the deterioration of our relationship with a single-source supplier, or any
16
unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance.
business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.
our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events, for which we are predominantly self-insured. the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses, seriously harm our revenue, profitability and financial condition, adversely affect our competitive position, increase our costs and expenses, and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california, and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. the manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations. we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products, and primarily in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region. our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, it system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. the ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions, such as near major earthquake faults, and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain.
our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.
our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter's total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter. this uneven sales pattern makes predicting net revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult, increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders, there may be excess inventory. alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be cancelled. depending on when they occur in a quarter, developments such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected.
we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition. for example, sales to governments (particularly sales to the u.s. government) are often stronger in the third calendar quarter, and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year. consumer sales are often higher in the fourth calendar quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. european sales are often weaker during the summer months. demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends. moreover, to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends, our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches. typically, our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest. many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.
due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance.
sales outside the united states made up approximately 63% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2016. in addition, a portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets. our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors, including:
•   ongoing instability or changes in a country's or region's economic, regulatory or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts or any other change resulting from brexit;
•   longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers, the imposition by governments of additional taxes, tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or changes in restrictions on trade between the united states and other countries;
•   trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production, shipping, pricing and marketing of products, including policies adopted by the united states or other countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors;
17
•   local labor conditions and regulations, including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and oems;
•   managing a geographically dispersed workforce;
•   changes or uncertainty in the international, national or local regulatory and legal environments;
•   differing technology standards or customer requirements;
•   import, export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments, which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets, affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components, increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions;
•   stringent privacy and data protection policies in some foreign countries;
•   difficulties associated with repatriating earnings generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes in tax laws; and
•   fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments.
the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states. for example, we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture.
in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended (the "fcpa"). although we implement policies, procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.
any failure by us to identify, manage and complete acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects.
as part of our business strategy, we may acquire companies or businesses, divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business (collectively, "business combination and investment transactions"). risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following, any of which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability and financial results:
•   managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations.
•   we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and investment transaction, and the timeframe for realizing the benefits of a particular business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees, advisors, suppliers, other third-parties or market trends.
•   certain prior business combination and investment transactions entered into by hewlett-packard company resulted, and in the future any such transactions by us may result, in significant costs and expenses, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, goodwill and asset impairment charges, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, asset impairment charges, inventory adjustments, assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans.
•   any increased or unexpected costs, unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations could make business combination and investment transactions less profitable or unprofitable.
•   our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions, and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence, is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third-parties or their representatives.
•   the pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts, and, during the course of our due diligence, we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate accurately our costs, timing and other matters or we may incur costs if a business combination is not consummated.
•   in order to complete a business combination and investment transaction, we may issue common stock, potentially creating dilution for our existing stockholders.
18
•   we may borrow to finance business combination and investment transactions, and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisition-related or other borrowings, as well as other factors, could affect our liquidity and financial condition.
•   our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain, and business combination and investment transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rate.
•   any announced business combination and investment transaction may not close on the expected timeframe or at all, which may cause our financial results to differ from expectations in a given quarter.
•   business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations.
•   if we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products, services and technology internally, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage.
we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions, and, to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired, we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. if there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units, we may incur additional charges, which may include goodwill impairment or intangible asset charges.
as part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives. when we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated. in addition, we may experience greater dis-synergies than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected. after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business, we are subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. such regulatory and governmental approvals may be required in diverse jurisdictions around the world, including jurisdictions with opaque regulatory frameworks, and any delays in the timing of such approvals could materially delay the transaction or prevent it from closing. for example, our acquisition of samsung's printer business is subject to regulatory review in numerous jurisdictions, including south korea and the european union, as well as customary closing conditions. dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results.
integrating acquisitions may be difficult and time-consuming. any failure by us to integrate acquired companies, products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results, business and prospects.
in order to pursue our strategy successfully, we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions, some of which may be large or complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses, products, services or employees. integration issues are often time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and implementation, could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business. the challenges involved in integration include:
•   successfully combining product and service offerings and entering or expanding into markets in which we are not experienced or are developing expertise;
•   convincing both our customers and distributors and those of the acquired business that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus;
•   persuading both our customers and distributors and those of the acquired business not to defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers (which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty), minimizing sales force attrition and expanding and coordinating sales, marketing and distribution efforts;
•   consolidating and rationalizing corporate it infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code and business processes;
•   minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns;

•   persuading employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired company's non-u.s. employees, integrating employees, correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs;
•   coordinating and combining administrative, manufacturing, research and development and other operations, subsidiaries, facilities and relationships with third-parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures;
•   achieving savings from supply chain integration; and
•   managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions.
we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plan and our restructuring may adversely affect our business.
we announced a restructuring plan in october 2016 to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs. implementation of the restructuring plan may be costly and disruptive to our business, and we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring. additionally, as a result of our restructuring, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency during transitional periods. reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. for more information about our october 2016 restructuring plan, see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8.
our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend.
we rely upon patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the united states, similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain intellectual property ("ip") rights in the products and services we sell, provide or otherwise use in our operations. however, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages, either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position. for example, our enforcement of inkjet printer supplies ip against infringers may be successfully challenged or our ip may be successfully circumvented. further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states. therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use; this, too, could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position.
our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties.
some of our business and some of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties. we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to our intellectual property. third-party components may become obsolete, defective or incompatible with future versions of our products, or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate, or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated. we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships. in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses, we must carefully monitor and manage our use of third-party components, including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms. additionally, some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive. our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business, including our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition, third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction. because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license to us at all, or refuse to license to us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors. consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights.
20
third-party claims of intellectual property infringement are commonplace in our industry and successful third-party claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services.
third parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. for example, patent assertion entities may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as us and our customers. if we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms, or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source, our operations could be adversely affected. even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend against and may divert management's attention and resources away from our business. claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing, marketing or selling certain of our products. even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us.
further, our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition, accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees. in certain countries (primarily in europe), proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded in which groups representing copyright owners have sought or are seeking to impose upon and collect from us levies upon equipment (such as pcs, mfds and printers) alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws. other such groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us. other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes, and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices. the total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy, the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy, and the per unit fee for each type of product, all of which are affected by several factors, including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving us and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries, and could be substantial. consequently, the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees, and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices, remains uncertain.
the allocation of intellectual property rights between hewlett packard enterprise and hp as part of the separation, and the shared use of certain intellectual property rights following the separation, could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive position.
in connection with the separation, hewlett-packard company allocated to each of hewlett packard enterprise and hp the intellectual property assets relevant to their respective businesses. the terms of the separation include cross-licenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the existing operations of both businesses. for example, through a joint brand holding structure, both hewlett packard enterprise and hp will retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlett-packard and hp branding, respectively. there is a risk that the joint brand holding structure may impair the enforcement of hp's trademark rights against third parties that infringe them. furthermore, as a result of this shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise could also adversely affect the reputation of hp. in addition, as a result of the allocation of intellectual property as part of the separation, we no longer own intellectual property allocated to hewlett packard enterprise and our resulting intellectual property ownership position could adversely affect our position and options relating to patent enforcement, patent licensing and cross-licensing, our ability to sell our products or services, our competitive position in the industry and our ability to enter new product markets.
our business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services business properly.
the risks that accompany our services business differ from those of our other businesses and include the following:
•   the success of our services business is to a significant degree dependent on our ability to retain our significant services clients and maintain or increase the level of revenues from these clients. we may lose clients due to their merger or acquisition, business failure, contract expiration or their selection of a competing service provider or decision to in-source services. in addition, we may not be able to retain or renew relationships with our significant clients. as a result of business downturns or for other business reasons, we are also vulnerable to reduced business from our clients, which can reduce the scope of services provided and the prices for those services. we may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost clients or reductions in services. in addition, our contracts may allow a client to terminate the contract for convenience, and we may not be able to fully recover our investments in such circumstances.
•   the pricing and other terms of some of our service agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results. any increased or unexpected costs or
21
unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable, which could have an adverse effect on the profit margin of our services business.
•   some of our service agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement. these agreements may involve the development and deployment of new technologies. varying degrees of performance risk exist in each agreement with these characteristics, and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development and deployment phases. any failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability, result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation, which could harm the financial performance of our services business.
•   if we do not hire, train, motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right geographic regions to meet the needs of our services clients, our financial performance could suffer. for example, if our employee utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the level of engagement of our employees could suffer. if that utilization rate is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed, as well as our ability to staff projects. if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current demand, we might need to redeploy existing personnel, increase our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels, all of which could also negatively affect our profitability. in addition, if we have more employees than we need with certain skill sets or in certain geographies, we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with client demand in those geographies.
failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements. in particular, our contracts with federal, state, provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations, contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and, in the case of our government contracts, fines and suspension from future government contracting. such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business. in addition, hewlett-packard company has in the past been, and we may in the future be, subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts, which could include claims for treble damages. further, any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them, regardless of its accuracy, may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts. if our customer contracts are terminated, if we are suspended or disbarred from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our financial performance could suffer.
our stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict.
our stock price, like that of other technology companies, can be volatile. some of the factors that could affect our stock price are:
•   speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community about, or actual changes in, our business, strategic position, market share, organizational structure, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, effectiveness of cost-cutting efforts, value or liquidity of our investments, exposure to market volatility, prospects, business combination or investment transactions, future stock price performance, board of directors, executive team, our competitors or our industry in general;
•   the announcement of new, planned or contemplated products, services, technological innovations, acquisitions, divestitures or other significant transactions by us or our competitors;
•   quarterly increases or decreases in net revenue, gross margin, earnings or cash flows, changes in estimates by the investment community or our financial outlook and variations between actual and estimated financial results;
•   announcements of actual and anticipated financial results by our competitors and other companies in the it industry;
•   developments relating to pending investigations, claims and disputes; and
•   the timing and amount of our share repurchases.
general or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance also may affect the price of our stock. for these reasons, investors should
22
not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.
failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.
our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies. fitch ratings, moody's investor service and standard & poor's rating services downgraded hewlett-packard company's ratings in the past. past downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities, have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper, and may require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts. we cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets.
we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations.
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors. our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7 of this report. in addition, as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, we make certain estimates, including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies. while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could adversely affect our results of operations.
unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance.
we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions. our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items. we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. tax authorities may disagree with these intercompany transactions or other matters, and may assess additional taxes or adjust taxable income on our tax returns as a result. we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. however, we cannot assure you that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. in addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws. in particular, if circumstances change such that we are unable to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside the united states, future income tax expense may differ significantly from historical amounts and could materially adversely affect our results. in addition, various tax legislation has been introduced or is being considered that could significantly impact our tax rate, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, or our deferred tax liabilities. any of these changes could affect our financial performance.
in order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition key employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.
in order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, development, sales, marketing and it support positions. identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining qualified executives, engineers and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future, and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense. in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash- and equity-based compensation. our equity-based incentive awards may contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our long-term financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain. if the anticipated value of such equity-based incentive awards does not materialize, if our equity-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity-based incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract, retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened. our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any
23
failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
system security risks, data protection breaches, cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.
experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. in addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third-parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including "bugs" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, including bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities, could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.
we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and our customers. breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our clients or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. we also could lose existing or potential customers or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers' system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services. in addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.
portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and resource intensive. such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes. delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.
terrorist acts, conflicts, wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price.
terrorist acts, conflicts or wars (wherever located around the world) may cause damage or disruption to our business, our employees, facilities, partners, suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics, operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other critical business operations. the potential for future attacks, the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security, and other actual or potential conflicts or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties. in addition, as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states, actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees. although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, if they occur, they could result in a decrease in demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers, create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions. we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts, conflicts and wars.
24
our business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations.
we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. for example, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the clean-up of contaminated sites, the content of our products and the recycling, treatment and disposal of our products, including batteries. in particular, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products, their safe use, the energy consumption associated with those products, climate change laws and regulations, and product take-back legislation. if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws, we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions, which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions. our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage, personal injury claims and clean-up costs. further, liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively, on a joint and several basis, and without any finding of noncompliance or fault. the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict.
some anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.
we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hp deemed undesirable by our board of directors. these include provisions:
•   authorizing blank check preferred stock, which we could issue with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;
•   limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;
•   specifying that our stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;
•   requiring advance notice of proposals by our stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors; and
•   controlling the procedures for conduct of our board of directors and stockholder meetings and election, appointment and removal of our directors.
these provisions, alone or together, could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in control or our management. as a delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of delaware law, including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.
any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hp could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our stock.
risks related to the separation the separation of hewlett-packard company into two independent publicly traded companies is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits.
on november 1, 2015, we completed the separation of our enterprise technology infrastructure, software, services and financing businesses from our personal systems and printing businesses. the process of completing the separation involved significant costs and expenses. uncertainty related to the separation may lead customers and other parties with which we currently do business or may do business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in our existing business relationships, or cause them to consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us. these disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
we may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational, marketing or other benefits from the separation. as an independent publicly traded company we are a smaller, less diversified company with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we continue to review our acquisitions, dispositions, and other transactions, including those related to the separation, in light of the economic and legislative environment.
25
the separation could result in substantial tax liability.
we obtained an opinion of outside counsel that, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the separation qualified, for both the company and our stockholders, as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of sections 368(d)(1)(d) and 355 of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended. in addition, we obtained a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service (the "irs") and opinions of outside counsel regarding certain matters impacting the u.s. federal income tax treatment of the separation for the company and certain related transactions as transactions that are generally tax-free for u.s. federal income tax purposes. the opinions of outside counsel and the irs private letter ruling were based, among other things, on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to outside counsel and the irs. if any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, reliance on the opinions and irs private letter ruling may be affected. an opinion of outside counsel represents their legal judgment but is not binding on the irs or any court. accordingly, there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. notwithstanding the foregoing, we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the separation, including non-u.s. tax expenses resulting from the separation in multiple non-u.s. jurisdictions that do not legally provide for tax-free separation, which may be material. if the separation or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we and/or our stockholders that are subject to u.s. federal income tax could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities.
we or hewlett packard enterprise may fail to perform under the transaction agreements executed as part of the separation.
in connection with the separation, we and hewlett packard enterprise entered into several agreements, including among others a transition services agreement, a separation and distribution agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, a real estate matters agreement, a commercial agreement and an it service agreement. the transition services agreement provides for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a transition period after the separation. the separation and distribution agreement, tax matters agreement, employee matters agreement and real estate matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. the commercial agreement establishes a bilateral relationship between hewlett packard enterprise and us for the purchase and sale of commercially available products and services for internal use, incorporation and bundling in oem products and services, resale to customers and use in the provision of managed services to customers, as well as joint customer pursuits and joint development activities. the it service agreement provides for the performance by one of hewlett packard enterprise's subsidiaries of certain application development and maintenance and it infrastructure services for us. we will rely on hewlett packard enterprise to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. if hewlett packard enterprise is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, we could incur operational difficulties or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

hp inc. separation transaction on november 1, 2015 (the "distribution date"), we completed the separation of hewlett packard enterprise company ("hewlett packard enterprise"), hewlett-packard company's former enterprise technology infrastructure, software, services and financing businesses (the "separation"). in connection with the separation, hewlett-packard company changed its name to hp inc. ("hp").
on the distribution date, each of our stockholders of record as of the close of business on october 21, 2015 (the "record date") received one share of hewlett packard enterprise common stock for every one share of our common stock held as of the record date. we distributed a total of approximately 1.8 billion shares of hewlett packard enterprise common stock to our stockholders. hewlett packard enterprise is an independent public company trading on the new york stock exchange ("nyse") under the symbol "hpe". after the separation, we do not beneficially own any shares of hewlett packard enterprise common stock.
in connection with the separation, we and hewlett packard enterprise have entered into a separation and distribution agreement as well as various other agreements that provide a framework for the relationships between hp and hewlett packard enterprise going forward, including among others a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, a transition service agreement, a real estate matters agreement, a master commercial agreement and an information technology service agreement.

hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
overview we are a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing products, and related technologies, solutions, and services. we sell to individual consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health, and education sectors. we have three segments for financial reporting purposes: personal systems, printing and corporate investments. the personal systems segment offers commercial personal computers ("pcs"), consumer pcs, workstations, thin clients, commercial tablets and mobility devices, retail point-of-sale systems, displays and other related accessories, software, support, and services for the commercial and consumer markets. the printing segment provides consumer and commercial printer hardware, supplies, media, solutions and services, as well as scanning devices. corporate investments include hp labs and certain business incubation projects.
•   in personal systems, our strategic focus is on profitable growth through improved market segmentation with respect to enhanced innovation in multi-operating systems, multi-architecture, geography, customer segments and other key attributes. additionally, hp is investing in premium and mobility form factors such as convertible notebooks, detachable notebooks, and commercial tablets and mobility devices in order to meet customer preference for mobile, thinner and lighter devices. we expect a decrease in the rate of the market decline and we believe that we are well positioned due to our competitive product lineup.
•   in printing, our strategic focus is on business printing, a shift to contractual solutions and graphics. business printing includes delivering solutions to smb and enterprise customers, such as multi-function and pagewide printers, including our jetintelligence lineup of laserjet printers. the shift to contractual solutions includes an increased focus on managed print services and instant ink, which presents strong aftermarket supplies opportunities. in the graphics space, we are focused on innovations such as our indigo and latex product offerings. we plan to continue to focus on shifting the mix in the installed base to higher value units and expanding our innovative ink, laser and graphics and 3d printing programs. we continue to execute on our key initiatives of focusing on products targeted at high usage categories and introducing new revenue delivery models. our ink in the office initiative is continuing to shift the installed base to more valuable units. in the commercial market, our focus is on placing higher value printer units which offer positive annuity of toner and ink, the design and deployment of a3 products and solutions, accelerating growth in graphic solutions products, and launching and developing our first 3d printers. during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we announced our decision to make a one-time investment over time to reduce the level of supplies inventory across the channels. this change in the supplies sales model supports our strategy of maintaining a more consistent value proposition by shifting from a push model to a pull model driven by market demand, and allows for less price variability.
we continue to experience challenges that are representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations. one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the decline in the pc device market and home printing. a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. our primary competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets, our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models, and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others. a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution.
•   in personal systems, we are witnessing soft demand in the pc market as customers hold onto their pcs longer, thereby extending pc refresh cycles. demand for pcs is being impacted by weaker macroeconomic conditions and currency depreciation in latin america, canada and certain asian and european markets. as such, we anticipate continued market headwinds.
•   in printing, we are experiencing the impact of demand challenges in consumer and commercial markets. we are also experiencing an overall competitive pricing environment and have yet to see evidence of a broad move for our japanese competitors to be less aggressive given the strength of the yen. we obtain a number of components from single sources due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. for instance, we source laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from canon. any decision by either party to not renew our agreement with canon or to limit or reduce the scope of the agreement could adversely affect our net revenue from laserjet products; however, we have a long-standing business relationship with canon and do not anticipate non-renewal of this agreement.
we may also face challenges as a result of the june 23, 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union (commonly known as "brexit").  the outcome of brexit and its impact on our business cannot be known until the terms and

timing of the united kingdom's exit are clearer.  until that time, we may face various brexit-related challenges that may include uncertainty in the markets, volatility in exchange rates and weaker macroeconomic conditions.
to address these challenges, we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with generating market demand and meeting the needs of our customers and partners. in addition, we need to continue to improve our operations, with a particular focus on enhancing our end-to-end processes and efficiencies. we also need to continue to optimize our sales coverage models, align our sales incentives with our strategic goals, improve channel execution, strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, and develop and capitalize on market opportunities.
for a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could impact our continuing operating results, see the section entitled "risk factors" in item 1a in this annual report on form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates general the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with united states ("u.s.") generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hp's board of directors. management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates. making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1, "overview and summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured, as well as when other revenue recognition principles are met, including industry-specific revenue recognition guidance.
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements we enter into which contain non-standard terms and conditions. further, many of our arrangements include multiple elements. as a result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting, the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements.
we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer. for elements with no standalone value, we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the delivery of the final deliverable. if the arrangement includes a customer-negotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control, the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting. in arrangements with combined units of accounting, changes in the allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract.
33
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
we establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence ("vsoe") of selling price, if available, third-party evidence ("tpe"), if vsoe of selling price is not available, or estimated selling price ("esp"), if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe is available. we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and, in rare instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority. we evaluate tpe of selling price by reviewing largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. esp is established based on management's judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle. consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles. we may modify or develop new go-to-market practices in the future, which may result in changes in selling prices, impacting both vsoe of selling price and esp. in most arrangements with multiple elements, the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price. however, the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods. this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods, but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement.
we reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, including price protection, rebates, promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected returns. future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered. for certain incentive programs, we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive.
for hardware products, we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners (including resellers, distributors and value-added solution providers) when the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. for indirect sales to channel partners, we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partner has economic substance apart from hp and hp has completed its obligations related to the sale.
we recognize revenue from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts ratably over the contract period.
warranty we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue. we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis. our standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time. while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms, repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience. warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts, labor and onsite services, depending upon the product. over the last three fiscal years, the annual warranty expense and actual warranty costs have averaged approximately 2.2% and 2.5% of annual net revenue, respectively.
restructuring and other charges we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs, fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete, and the fair value of lease cancellation and other exit costs. we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements. other charges include non-recurring costs that are distinct from ongoing operational costs such as information technology costs incurred in connection with the separation. for a full description of our restructuring actions, refer to our discussions of restructuring in "results of operations" below and in note 4, "restructuring and other charges" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.
retirement and post-retirement benefits our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions. our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates, mortality rates, expected increases in compensation levels and the expected long-
34
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
term return on plan assets. the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period. mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan. the expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our long-term actual experience and future expectations. the expected long-term return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations, historical portfolio results, historical asset correlations and management's expected returns for each asset class. we evaluate our expected return assumptions annually including reviewing current capital market assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the expected long-term return on plan assets. we update the expected long-term return on assets when we observe a sufficient level of evidence that would suggest the long-term expected return has changed. in any fiscal year, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected long-term return on plan assets. historically, differences between the actual return and expected long-term return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation, short-term performance relative to expected long-term performance, and to a lesser extent, differences between target and actual investment allocations, the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations, and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures. for the recognition of net periodic benefit cost, the calculation of the expected long-term return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year unless updated as a result of interim remeasurement.
our major assumptions vary by plan, and the weighted-average rates used are set forth in note 5, "retirement and post-retirement benefit plans" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. the following table provides the impact a change of 25 basis points in each of the weighted-average assumptions of the discount rate, expected increase in compensation levels and expected long-term return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal year 2016:
change in net periodicbenefit cost in millions assumptions:
discount rate                                                             $9
expected increase in compensation levels                                  $2
expected long-term return on plan assets                                 $31
taxes on earnings we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns. we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse.
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. in determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination. likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.
our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided united states federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states. we plan distributions of foreign earnings based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long-term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations. based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest outside the united states and the amounts we expect to distribute to the united states and provide the united
35
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
states federal taxes due on amounts expected to be distributed to the united states. further, as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken, income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and, in some cases, is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2027. material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the united states, and our related future effective tax rate.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and approximately 58 other countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax provision, net income and cash flows. our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany transactions and related interest. for a further discussion on taxes on earnings, refer to note 7, "taxes on earnings" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis. we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence. factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand, technological changes, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality issues.
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit's goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the two-step impairment test. based on the qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test will be performed.
in the first step of the impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount with the fair values derived most significantly from the income approach, and to a lesser extent, the market approach. under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. we base cash flow projections on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. we base the discount rate on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. under the market approach, we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. we weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publicly-traded companies to the reporting unit. when market comparables are not meaningful or not available, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach.
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. in the second step, we measure the reporting unit's assets, including any unrecognized intangible assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. if the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying amount, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.
our annual goodwill impairment analysis, performed using the qualitative assessment option as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, resulted in a conclusion that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting
36
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
units exceeded their respective carrying values. as a result, we concluded that the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary.
fair value of derivative instruments we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we use forwards, swaps and at times, options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. as of october 31, 2016, the gross notional value of our derivative portfolio was $17.9 billion. assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value, and were $325 million and $97 million, respectively as of october 31, 2016.
fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued. we generally use industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions. when prices in active markets are not available for the identical asset or liability, we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value. where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, hp and counterparty credit risk, foreign currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices.
for a further discussion on fair value measurements and derivative instruments, refer to note 10, "fair value" and note 11, "financial instruments", respectively, to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings including those consisting of intellectual property ("ip"), commercial, securities, employment, employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability. we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events, pertaining to a particular case. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, we share responsibility with hewlett packard enterprise for certain matters, as discussed in note 15, "litigation and contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference, and hewlett packard enterprise has agreed to indemnify us in whole or in part with respect to certain matters. based on our experience, we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in note 15, "litigation and contingencies", are not a meaningful indicator of hp's potential liability. litigation is inherently unpredictable. however, we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of october 31, 2016, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements.

revenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to represent, a majority of our overall net revenue. as a result, our net revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect it will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we supplementally present the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue on a constant currency basis, which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prior-year period and does not adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. this information is provided so that net revenue can be viewed with and without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our net revenue results and trends. this constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue on a gaap basis. other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.

r&d expense increased 2% in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to incremental investments in a3 and 3d printing, partially offset by favorable currency impacts.
r&d expense decreased 8% in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to favorable currency impacts.
selling, general and administrative ("sg&a")
sg&a expense decreased 19% in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to gains from the divestiture of certain software assets to open text corporation, lower corporate governance and other overhead costs related to the pre-separation combined entity, our cost saving initiatives and favorable currency impacts. these effects were partially offset by the gain from the divestiture of snapfish in the prior-year period.
sg&a expense decreased 12% in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to favorable currency impacts and declines in go-to-market costs as a result of lower commissions and productivity initiatives.
amortization of intangible assets amortization expense decreased by $86 million and $27 million in fiscal year 2016 and in fiscal year 2015 respectively, primarily due to prior acquisitions reaching the end of their respective amortization periods.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges increased by $142 million in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to severance pay and infrastructure related charges from our restructuring plan initially announced in september 2015 (the "fiscal 2015 plan").
on october 10, 2016, our board of directors approved a restructuring plan (the "fiscal 2017 plan") which will be implemented through fiscal year 2019. hp recognized $24 million of charges related to the fiscal 2017 plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016.
restructuring and other charges decreased by $113 million in fiscal year 2015 primarily due to lower charges from our restructuring plan initially announced in may 2012 (the "fiscal 2012 plan"). hp recognized $39 million of charges related to the fiscal 2015 plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015.
interest and other, net

hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
interest and other, net expense decreased by $600 million in fiscal year 2016. the decrease was primarily due to changes in indemnification receivables from hewlett packard enterprise for certain tax liabilities that hp is jointly and severally liable for, but for which it is indemnified by hewlett packard enterprise under the tax matters agreement and lower foreign currency losses, partially offset by lower interest income.
interest and other, net expense decreased by $5 million in fiscal year 2015. the decrease was due to lower other miscellaneous expense.
provision for taxes our effective tax rates were 29.1%, (5.3)% and 24.3% in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. our effective tax rate generally differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world. the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented were puerto rico, singapore, china, malaysia and ireland. we plan to reinvest certain earnings of these jurisdictions indefinitely outside the united states and therefore has not provided u.s. taxes on those indefinitely reinvested earnings. in addition to the above factors, the overall tax rates in fiscal year 2016 were impacted by adjustments to valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions.
for a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation of our provision for taxes, see note 7, "taxes on earnings" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
in fiscal 2016, we recorded $301 million of net income tax charges related to items unique to the year for continuing operations. these amounts primarily include uncertain tax position charges of $525 million related to pre-separation tax matters. in addition, we recorded $62 million of net tax benefits on restructuring and other charges, $52 million of net tax benefits related to the release of foreign valuation allowances and $41 million of net tax benefits arising from the retroactive research and development credit provided by the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 signed into law in december 2015 and $70 million of other tax benefit.
in fiscal year 2015, we recorded $1.2 billion of net income tax benefits related to items unique to the year. these amounts included $1.7 billion of tax benefits due to a release of valuation allowances pertaining to certain u.s. deferred tax assets, $449 million of tax charges related to uncertain tax positions on pension transfers, $70 million of tax benefits related to state tax impacts, and $6 million of income tax charges related to various other items. in addition, we recorded $33 million of income tax charges on restructuring and pension-related costs.
in fiscal year 2014, we recorded $69 million of net income tax benefits related to items unique to the year. these amounts included $37 million of income tax benefits related to provision to return adjustments, $25 million of income tax charges related to state rate changes, $41 million of income tax benefits for adjustments related to uncertain tax positions, and $16 million of income tax benefits related to other items.

fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015
personal systems net revenue decreased 4.9% (decreased 0.9% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal year 2016. the net revenue decline in personal systems was primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts and weak market demand. personal systems net revenue decreased as a result of a 3.5% decline in unit volume along with a 1% decline in average selling price ("asp") as compared to the prior-year period. the unit volume decline was primarily due to an overall decline in desktops and consumer notebooks, partially offset by unit volume growth in commercial notebooks. the decline in asp was primarily due to competitive pricing in the commercial segment partially offset by favorable pricing in the consumer segment and favorable mix shift in consumer high-end premium products.
consumer and commercial revenue both decreased by 5%, primarily due to weak market demand, partially offset by an increase in commercial notebooks and pc services. net revenue declined 2% in notebooks, 9% in desktops, 7% in workstations and 9% in other as compared to the prior-year period. the net revenue decline in other was primarily due to lower sales in consumer tablets and personal systems options partially offset by revenue growth in pc services.
personal systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.6 percentage points in fiscal year 2016. the increase was primarily due to growth in gross margin driven by favorable commodity costs combined with product mix and increase in pc services, the effects of which were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts in revenue. operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.1 percentage point primarily driven by an increase in field selling cost.
fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014
personal systems net revenue decreased 8.3% (decreased 3.1% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal year 2015. the net revenue decline in personal systems was primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts, particularly in emea, and weakening market demand. personal systems net revenue decreased as a result of a 5% decline in asp and a 3% decline in unit volume. the decline in asp was primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts, a shift in consumer pcs to low end products and a

lower mix of commercial pcs within personal systems. the unit volume decline was primarily due to a unit volume decline in desktops, partially offset by a unit volume growth in notebooks, both consumer and commercial.
net revenue for commercial clients decreased 8% primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts, a decline in commercial desktops as a result of weak market demand and higher net revenue in the prior-year period resulting from the replacement of the windows xp operating system. net revenue for consumer clients decreased 8% primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts and a decline in consumer desktops. net revenue declined 17% in desktop pcs, 2% in notebook pcs, 9% in workstations and 10% in other. the net revenue decline in other was primarily due to a decline in consumer tablets, the sale of intellectual property assets in the prior-year period, and unfavorable currency impacts, the effects of which were partially offset by increased sales of extended warranties.
personal systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.5 percentage points for fiscal year 2015 as a result of a decline in gross margin combined with an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. the decline in gross margin was primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts and a lower mix of commercial products, partially offset by favorable component costs and operational cost improvements. operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased primarily due to the size of the net revenue decline, higher administrative expenses as a result of lower bad debt recoveries as compared to the prior-year period and higher r&d investments in commercial, mobility and immersive computing products, the effects of which were partially offset by a decline in field selling costs as a result of favorable currency impacts and operational cost improvements.

printing net revenue decreased 14.0% (decreased 9.3% on a constant currency basis) for fiscal year 2016. the decline in net revenue was primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts, weakness in demand, impact from the change in the supplies sales model and competitive pricing pressures. these factors resulted in a net revenue decline across supplies and consumer and commercial hardware. net revenue for supplies decreased 15.1% as compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts, demand weakness combined with a competitive pricing environment and impact of the change in the supplies sales model. printer unit volume decreased 12% and asp increased by 2% as compared to the prior-year period. printer unit volume decreased due to weakness in demand, our pricing discipline and focus on placing positive npv units. printer asp increased primarily due to a favorable mix shift to high-value printers, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts.
net revenue for commercial hardware decreased 6% for fiscal year 2016 as compared to the prior-year period primarily driven by a 6% decline in unit volume and a decrease in other peripheral printing solutions. the unit volume in commercial hardware declined primarily due to a unit volume decline in laserjet printers. the asp in commercial hardware increased slightly primarily due to mix shift to high-value printer sales offset by unfavorable currency impacts. printer unit volume in consumer hardware declined 15%, combined with a decline in other printing solutions largely driven by the divestiture of snapfish in the prior-year period and a 9% decline in asp, resulted in a 30% decline in consumer hardware net revenue for fiscal year 2016 as compared to the prior-year period. the unit volume decline in consumer hardware was primarily due to weakness in demand, our pricing discipline and our continued efforts to place positive npv units. the asp in consumer hardware decreased primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts.
printing earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.6% percentage points for fiscal year 2016 as compared to the prior-year period due to decline in gross margin, partially offset by the gains from the divestiture of certain software assets. the gross margin decline was primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts and supplies mix, partially offset by operational improvements and favorable mix of printers. operating expenses decreased primarily due to the gains from the divestiture of certain software assets to open text corporation and cost-saving initiatives.
fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014
printing net revenue decreased 8.5% (decreased 5.1% on a constant currency basis) for fiscal year 2015. the decline in net revenue was primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts, decline in supplies, weak market demand and competitive pricing pressures, the effects of which were partially offset by growth in graphics products. from a regional perspective, printing experienced a net revenue decline across all regions, primarily in emea and particularly in russia as a result of challenges in those markets.
net revenue for supplies decreased 6% primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts and demand weakness in toner and ink, partially offset by growth in graphics supplies. the demand weakness in toner was particularly in emea, led by a net revenue decline in russia. printer unit volumes declined 7% while asp decreased 7%. printer unit volume declined primarily due to a decline in laserjet and home printer units, the effects of which were partially offset by growth in graphics printer units. the asp for printers decreased primarily due to a highly competitive pricing environment and unfavorable currency impacts on inkjet and laserjet printers. net revenue for commercial hardware decreased 9% driven by a 7% decline in printer unit volume and a 4% decline in asp, partially offset by a net revenue increase in other peripheral solutions. in commercial hardware, the decline in unit volume was primarily due to an overall decline in laserjet printer units, partially offset by growth in graphics printer units. the asp decline in commercial hardware was primarily due to a competitive pricing environment and unfavorable currency impacts. net revenue for consumer hardware decreased 21% driven by a 13% decline in asp, 7% decline in unit volume and a decline in other peripheral solutions. the asp decline in consumer hardware was primarily due to a competitive pricing environment and unfavorable currency impacts. the unit volume decline in consumer hardware was primarily due to lower sales of home and smb printer units.
printing earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue declined 0.2 percentage points for fiscal year 2015 due to a decline in gross margin, partially offset by lower operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. the decline in gross margin was primarily due to a competitive pricing environment in hardware and unfavorable currency impacts, the effects of which were partially offset by a favorable mix of ink and graphics supplies and favorable currency impacts from the japanese yen. operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased primarily due to our cost saving initiatives, lower marketing expenses, the impact of the divestiture of our photo printing service snapfish and favorable currency impacts.

liquidity and capital resources we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. we believe that internally generated cash flows are generally sufficient to support our operating businesses, capital expenditures, restructuring activities, maturing debt, income tax payments and the payment of stockholder dividends, in addition to investments and share repurchases. we are able to supplement this short-term liquidity, if necessary, with broad access to capital markets and credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions. our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic conditions; however, our access to a variety of funding sources to meet our liquidity needs is designed to facilitate continued access to capital resources under all such conditions. our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled "risk factors" in item 1a and market risks identified in the section entitled "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" in item 7a, which is incorporated herein by reference.
our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with majority of those amounts held outside of the united states. we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. our cash position remains strong, and we expect that our cash balances, anticipated cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected near-term cash outlays.
in september 2016, hp entered into a definitive agreement to acquire samsung electronics co., ltd.'s printer business for $1.05 billion. the transaction is expected to close within 12 months pending regulatory review and other customary closing conditions.
amounts held outside of the united states are generally utilized to support non-u.s. liquidity needs, although a portion of those amounts may from time to time be subject to short-term intercompany loans into the united states. most of the amounts held outside of the united states could be repatriated to the united states but, under current law, some would be subject to u.s. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. repatriation of some foreign earnings is restricted by local law. except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states, we have provided for the u.s. federal tax liability on these earnings for financial statement purposes. repatriation could result in additional income tax payments in future years. where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the united states and we would meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately $5.8 billion for fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. the decrease was due primarily to lower cash generated from working capital management activities, payments for separation costs, lower cash receipts from contract manufacturers and financing receivables, lower net earnings in the current period, unfavorable currency impacts, as well as higher cash payments for prepaid expenses and employee benefits.

the cash conversion cycle is the sum of days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("dso") and days of supply in inventory ("dos") less days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable ("dpo"). items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ from a long-term sustainable rate include, but are not limited to, changes in business mix, changes in payment terms, extent of receivables factoring, seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period.
dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average of net revenue. for fiscal year 2016, the decrease in dso compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to favorable revenue linearity and strong collections, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts. for fiscal year 2015, the increase in dso compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to lower usage of cash discounts by our customers.
dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. for fiscal year 2016, the dos was flat compared to fiscal year 2015 due to strong inventory management offset by higher inventory balance to support future sales levels. for fiscal year 2015, the increase in dos compared to fiscal year 2014 was due to higher inventory balance to support future sales levels.
dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. for fiscal year 2016, the increase in dpo compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily the result of extension of payment terms with our product suppliers and increased strategic inventory purchases. for fiscal year 2015, the increase in dpo compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily the result of purchasing linearity and an extension of payment terms with our product suppliers.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased by $5.6 billion for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015, due to capital expenditures and payments made in connection with business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in fiscal year 2015 by the discontinued operations.
net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately $2.7 billion for fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily due to the acquisition of aruba networks, inc., which was transferred to hewlett packard enterprise as a part of the separation.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased by $15.8 billion in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to the cash transfer of $10.4 billion to hewlett packard enterprise in connection with the separation, the redemption of $2.1 billion of u.s. dollar global notes and cash utilization of $2.0 billion for repurchases of common stock and dividends.
net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately $7.9 billion for fiscal year 2015 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $6.6 billion in fiscal year 2014. the change was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in october 2015 by hewlett packard enterprise in principal amount of $14.6 billion and higher proceeds from issuance of commercial paper, partially offset by the redemption of $6.6 billion of u.s. dollar global notes and higher repayment of commercial paper as compared to fiscal year 2014.

we maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including acquisitions), share repurchase activities, our cost of capital and targeted capital structure.
short-term debt decreased by $2.1 billion and long-term debt increased by $0.1 billion for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015. the net decrease in total debt was primarily due to redemption of $2.1 billion of fixed rate u.s. dollar global notes in november 2015.
short-term debt decreased by $0.4 billion and long-term debt decreased by $8.9 billion for fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. the net decrease in total debt was primarily due to the redemption of $6.6 billion of u.s. dollar global notes in connection with the separation and maturities of $2.5 billion of u.s. dollar global notes in fiscal year 2015. during the month of november 2015, we paid $2.1 billion for the redemption of u.s. dollar global notes as part of the final settlement of the debt redeemed as a part of the separation.
our debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as the carrying amount of debt divided by total stockholders' equity. our debt-to-equity ratio decreased by 2.08x in fiscal year 2016, primarily due to negative equity resulting from the transfer of net assets of $32.5 billion to hewlett packard enterprise and redemption of $2.1 billion of fixed-rate u.s. dollar global notes due to the separation. during fiscal year 2016, we generated operating cash flow of $3.2 billion. our debt-to-equity ratio decreased by 0.35x in fiscal year 2015, due to a decrease in total debt balances of $9.3 billion coupled with an increase in total stockholders' equity by $1.0 billion at the end of fiscal year 2015.
our weighted-average interest rate reflects the effective interest rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the effect of interest rate swaps. for more information on our interest rate swaps, see note 11, "financial instruments" in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data".
as of october 31, 2016, we maintain a senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with aggregate lending commitments of $4.0 billion, which will be available until april 2, 2019 and is primarily to support the issuance of commercial paper. funds borrowed under this revolving credit facility may also be used for general corporate purposes.
available borrowing resources as of october 31, 2016, we had available borrowing resources of $822 million from uncommitted lines of credit in addition to our $4.0 billion senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility discussed above. for more information on our borrowings, see note 12, "borrowings", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii, which is incorporated herein by reference.
credit ratings our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information obtained in our ongoing discussions with them. while we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt, previous downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities, have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and have required the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts. in addition, any further downgrade to our credit ratings by any rating agencies may further impact us in a similar manner, and, depending on the extent of any such downgrade, could have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital position. we can access alternative sources of funding, including drawdowns under our credit facilities, if necessary, to offset potential reductions in the market capacity for our commercial paper.

contractual and other obligations our contractual and other obligations as of october 31, 2016, were as follows:
payments due by period total            1 year orless             1-3 years             3-5 years           more than 5 years in millions principal payments on debt(1)       $6,558                   $28                   $421                $2,899                    $3,210

(1)   amounts represent the principal cash payments relating to our short-term and long-term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments, discounts or premiums.
(2)   amounts represent the expected interest payments relating to our short-term and long-term debt. we have outstanding interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of changing fixed interest rates associated with some of our u.s. dollar global notes to variable interest rates. the impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps at october 31, 2016 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on debt.
(3)   purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. these purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items. purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. even though open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.
(4)   amounts represent the operating lease obligations, net of total sublease income of $218 million.
(5)   amounts represent the capital lease obligations, including total capital lease interest obligations of $35 million.
(6)   retirement and post-retirement benefit plan contributions. in fiscal year 2017, we anticipate making contributions of $26 million to non-u.s. pension plans, approximately $33 million to cover benefit payments to u.s. non-qualified pension plan participants and approximately $9 million to cover benefit claims for our post-retirement benefit plans. our policy is to fund our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by local government, funding and taxing authorities. expected contributions and payments to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes. for more information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see note 5, "retirement and post-retirement benefit plans", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
(7)   cost savings plans. we expect to make future cash payments of between $384 million and $534 million in connection with our cost savings plans through fiscal year 2019. these payments have been excluded from the contractual obligations table, because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments. for more information on our restructuring activities, see note 4, "restructuring and other charges", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
(8)   uncertain tax positions. as of october 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.9 billion of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters. payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. for more information on our uncertain tax positions,

off-balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
we have third-party short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers. for more information on our third-party short-term financing arrangements, see note 8 "balance sheet details" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

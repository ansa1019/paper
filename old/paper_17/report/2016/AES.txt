item 1a. risk factors you should consider carefully the following risks, along with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this form 10-k. additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations including those discussed in item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form 10-k. if any of the following events actually occur, our business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
we routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different, sometimes materially different, than we presently anticipate. the categories of risk we have identified in item 1a.-risk factors of this form 10-k include the following:
•   risks related to our high level of indebtedness;
•   risks associated with our ability to raise needed capital;
•   external risks associated with revenue and earnings volatility;
•   risks associated with our operations; and
•   risks associated with governmental regulation and laws.
these risk factors should be read in conjunction with item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.
risks related to our high level of indebtedness we have a significant amount of debt, a large percentage of which is secured, which could adversely affect our business and the ability to fulfill our obligations.
as of december 31, 2016, we had approximately $20.5 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis. all outstanding borrowings, if any, under the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility are secured by certain of our assets, including the pledge of capital stock of many of the aes corporation's directly held subsidiaries. most of the debt of the aes corporation's subsidiaries is secured by substantially all of the assets of those subsidiaries. since we have such a high level of debt, a substantial portion of cash flow from operations must be used to make payments on this debt. furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are used to secure this debt, this reduces the amount of collateral that is available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces our flexibility in dealing with these secured assets. this high level of indebtedness and related security could have other important consequences to us and our investors, including:
•   making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations at the holding company and/or individual subsidiaries;
•   increasing the likelihood of a downgrade of our debt, which could cause future debt costs and/or payments to increase under our debt and related hedging instruments and consume an even greater portion of cash flow;
•   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions, including but not limited to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices;
•   reducing the availability of cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business;
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;
•   placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and
•   limiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.
the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, limit, but do not prohibit the incurrence of additional indebtedness. to the extent we become more leveraged, the risks described
57
above would increase. further, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. accordingly, our cash flows may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and, in that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt as it becomes due. see note 11-debt included in item 8. of this form 10-k for a schedule of our debt maturities.
the aes corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its public debt securities, is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise.
the aes corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. all of the aes corporation's revenue is generated through its subsidiaries. accordingly, almost all of the aes corporation's cash flow is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries. therefore, the aes corporation's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of the subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, tax sharing payments, loans or otherwise.
however, our subsidiaries face various restrictions in their ability to distribute cash to the aes corporation. most of the subsidiaries are obligated, pursuant to loan agreements, indentures or non-recourse financing arrangements, to satisfy certain restricted payment covenants or other conditions before they may make distributions to the aes corporation. in addition, the payment of dividends or the making of loans, advances or other payments to the aes corporation may be subject to other contractual, legal or regulatory restrictions or may be prohibited altogether. business performance and local accounting and tax rules may limit the amount of retained earnings that may be distributed to us as a dividend. subsidiaries in foreign countries may also be prevented from distributing funds to the aes corporation as a result of foreign governments restricting the repatriation of funds or the conversion of currencies. any right that the aes corporation has to receive any assets of any of its subsidiaries upon any liquidation, dissolution, winding up, receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings (and the consequent right of the holders of the aes corporation's indebtedness to participate in the distribution of, or to realize proceeds from, those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of any such subsidiary's creditors (including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiary).
the aes corporation's subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, unless they have expressly guaranteed any of the aes corporation's indebtedness, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to such debt or to make any funds available whether by dividends, fees, loans or other payments.
even though the aes corporation is a holding company, existing and potential future defaults by subsidiaries or affiliates could adversely affect the aes corporation.
we attempt to finance our domestic and foreign projects primarily under loan agreements and related documents which, except as noted below, require the loans to be repaid solely from the project's revenues and provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of that project subsidiary or affiliate. this type of financing is usually referred to as non-recourse debt or "non-recourse financing." in some non-recourse financings, the aes corporation has explicitly agreed to undertake certain limited obligations and contingent liabilities, most of which by their terms will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events. these obligations and liabilities take the form of guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, letter of credit reimbursement agreements and agreements to pay, in certain circumstances, the project lenders or other parties.
as of december 31, 2016, we had approximately $20.5 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, of which approximately $4.7 billion was recourse debt of the aes corporation and approximately $15.8 billion was non-recourse debt. in addition, we have outstanding guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, and other credit support commitments which are further described in this form 10-k in item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-capital resources and liquidity-parent company liquidity.
some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. the total debt classified as current in our consolidated balance sheets related to such defaults was $128 million as of december 31, 2016. while the lenders under our non-recourse financings generally do not have direct recourse to the aes corporation (other than to the extent of any credit support given by the aes corporation), defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for the aes corporation, including, without limitation:
58
•   reducing the aes corporation's receipt of subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other sources of cash since the project subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the aes corporation during the pendency of any default;
•   under certain circumstances, triggering the aes corporation's obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support which the aes corporation has provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;
•   causing the aes corporation to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets;
•   triggering defaults in the aes corporation's outstanding debt and trust preferred securities. for example, the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility and outstanding senior notes include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. in addition, the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility includes certain events of default relating to accelerations of outstanding material debt of material subsidiaries or any subsidiaries that in the aggregate constitute a material subsidiary;
•   the loss or impairment of investor confidence in the company; or
•   foreclosure on the assets that are pledged under the non-recourse loans, therefore eliminating any and all potential future benefits derived from those assets.
none of the projects that are currently in default are owned by subsidiaries that individually or in the aggregate meet the applicable standard of materiality in the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility or other debt agreements in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under such indebtedness. however, as a result of future mix of distributions, write-down of assets, dispositions and other matters that affect our financial position and results of operations, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries, individually or in the aggregate, could fall within the applicable standard of materiality and thereby upon an acceleration of such subsidiary's debt, trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility or other indebtedness of the aes corporation.
risks associated with our ability to raise needed capital the aes corporation, or the parent company, has significant cash requirements and limited sources of liquidity.
the aes corporation requires cash primarily to fund:
•   principal repayments of debt;
•   interest and preferred dividends;
•   acquisitions;
•   construction and other project commitments;
•   other equity commitments, including business development investments;
•   equity repurchases and/or cash dividends on our common stock;
•   taxes; and
•   parent company overhead costs.
the aes corporation's principal sources of liquidity are:
•   dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries;
•   proceeds from debt and equity financings at the parent company level; and
•   proceeds from asset sales.
for a more detailed discussion of the aes corporation's cash requirements and sources of liquidity, please see item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-capital resources and liquidity in this form 10-k.
while we believe that these sources will be adequate to meet our obligations at the parent company level for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital or commercial lending markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, exchange rates, our ability to sell assets, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and other distributions. any number of assumptions could prove to be incorrect, and, therefore there can be no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected. for example, in recent years, certain financial institutions have gone bankrupt. in the event that a bank who is party to our senior secured credit facility or other facilities goes bankrupt or is otherwise unable
59
to fund its commitments, we would need to replace that bank in our syndicate or risk a reduction in the size of the facility, which would reduce our liquidity. in addition, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay at maturity the entire principal outstanding under our credit facility and our debt securities and we may have to refinance such obligations. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all and any of these events could have a material effect on us.
our ability to grow our business could be materially adversely affected if we were unable to raise capital on favorable terms.
from time to time, we rely on access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. our ability to arrange for financing on either a recourse or non-recourse basis and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:
•   general economic and capital market conditions;
•   the availability of bank credit;
•   investor confidence;
•   the financial condition, performance and prospects of the aes corporation in general and/or that of any subsidiary requiring the financing as well as companies in our industry or similar financial circumstances; and
•   changes in tax and securities laws which are conducive to raising capital.
should future access to capital not be available to us, we may have to sell assets or decide not to build new plants or expand or improve existing facilities, either of which would affect our future growth, results of operations or financial condition.
a downgrade in the credit ratings of the aes corporation or its subsidiaries could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets which could increase our interest costs or adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow.
if any of the credit ratings of the aes corporation or its subsidiaries were to be downgraded, our ability to raise capital on favorable terms could be impaired and our borrowing costs could increase. furthermore, depending on the aes corporation's credit ratings and the trading prices of its equity and debt securities, counterparties may no longer be as willing to accept general unsecured commitments by the aes corporation to provide credit support. accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, the aes corporation may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit and/or collateral, to backstop or replace any credit support by the aes corporation. there can be no assurance that such counterparties will accept such guarantees or that aes could arrange such further assurances in the future. in addition, to the extent the aes corporation is required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, it will limit the amount of credit available to the aes corporation to meet its other liquidity needs.
we may not be able to raise sufficient capital to fund developing projects in certain less developed economies which could change or in some cases adversely affect our growth strategy.
part of our strategy is to grow our business by developing businesses in less developed economies where the return on our investment may be greater than projects in more developed economies. commercial lending institutions sometimes refuse to provide non-recourse project financing in certain less developed economies, and in these situations we have sought and will continue to seek direct or indirect (through credit support or guarantees) project financing from a limited number of multilateral or bilateral international financial institutions or agencies. as a precondition to making such project financing available, the lending institutions may also require governmental guarantees for certain project and sovereign related risks. there can be no assurance, however, that project financing from the international financial agencies or that governmental guarantees will be available when needed, and if they are not, we may have to abandon the project or invest more of our own funds which may not be in line with our investment objectives and would leave less funds for other projects.
external risks associated with revenue and earnings volatility our businesses may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be exposed to price volatility as a result of risks associated with the wholesale electricity markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.
some of our businesses sell electricity in the spot markets in cases where they operate at levels in excess of their power sales agreements or retail load obligations. our businesses may also buy electricity in the wholesale spot markets. as a result, we are exposed to the risks of rising and falling prices in those markets. the open market wholesale prices for electricity can be volatile and often reflect the fluctuating cost of fuels such as coal, natural gas
60
or oil derivative fuels in addition to other factors described below. consequently, any changes in the supply and cost of coal, natural gas, or oil derivative fuels may impact the open market wholesale price of electricity.
volatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from among other things:
•   plant availability in the markets generally;
•   availability and effectiveness of transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties;
•   competition;
•   electricity usage;
•   seasonality;
•   foreign exchange rate fluctuation;
•   availability and price of emission credits;
•   hydrology and other weather conditions;
•   illiquid markets;
•   transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies;
•   availability of competitively priced renewables sources;
•   increased adoption of distributed generation;
•   available supplies of natural gas, crude oil and refined products, and coal;
•   generating unit performance;
•   natural disasters, terrorism, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events;
•   energy, market and environmental regulation, legislation and policies;
•   geopolitical concerns affecting global supply of oil and natural gas;
•   general economic conditions in areas where we operate which impact energy consumption; and
•   bidding behavior and market bidding rules.
our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations.
our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. while the consolidated financial statements are reported in u.s. dollars, the financial statements of many of our subsidiaries outside the u.s. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into u.s. dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. as a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar relative to the local currencies where our subsidiaries outside the u.s. report could cause significant fluctuations in our results. in addition, while our expenses with respect to foreign operations are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, we have transaction exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary's functional currency. moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations. our financial position and results of operations could be affected by fluctuations in the value of a number of currencies. see item 7a.-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to this form 10-k for further information.
we may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates.
we routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity, fuel requirements and other commodities to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. as part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed price or indexed forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. we also enter into contracts which help us manage our interest rate exposure. however, we may not cover the entire exposure of our assets or positions to market price or interest rate volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. furthermore, the risk management practices we have in place may not always perform as planned. in particular, if prices of commodities or interest rates significantly deviate from historical prices or interest rates or if the price or interest rate volatility or distribution of these changes deviates from historical norms, our risk management practices may not protect us from significant losses. as a result, fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates may negatively impact our financial results to the extent we have unhedged or inadequately hedged positions. in addition, certain types of economic hedging activities may not qualify for hedge accounting under u.s. gaap, resulting in increased
61
volatility in our net income. the company may also suffer losses associated with "basis risk" which is the difference in performance between the hedge instrument and the targeted underlying exposure. furthermore, there is a risk that the current counterparties to these arrangements may fail or are unable to perform part or all of their obligations under these arrangements.
our coal-fired facilities in the u.s. continue to face substantial challenges as a result of high coal prices relative to natural gas, particularly those which are merchant plants that are exposed to market risk and those that have hybrid merchant risk, meaning those businesses that have a ppa in place but purchase fuel at market prices or under short term contracts. for our businesses with ppa pricing that does not perfectly pass through our fuel costs, the businesses attempt to manage the exposure through flexible fuel purchasing and timing of entry and terms of our fuel supply agreements; however, these risk management efforts may not be successful and the resulting commodity exposure could have a material impact on these businesses and/or our results of operations.
supplier and/or customer concentration may expose the company to significant financial credit or performance risks.
we often rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and other services required for the operation of certain of our facilities. if these suppliers cannot perform, we would seek to meet our fuel requirements by purchasing fuel at market prices, exposing us to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price, which could adversely impact the profitability of the affected business and our results of operations, and could result in a breach of agreements with other counterparties, including, without limitation, offtakers or lenders.
at times, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. we have also hedged a portion of our exposure to power price fluctuations through forward fixed price power sales. counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations. we may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements, or at all. if we were unable to enter into replacement ppas, these businesses may have to sell power at market prices. a breach by a counterparty of a ppa or other agreement could also result in the breach of other agreements, including, without limitation, the debt documents of the affected business.
the failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations to the aes corporation or our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. consequently, the financial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers.
the market pricing of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in future periods.
the market price for our common stock has been volatile in the past, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future. stock price movements on a quarter-by-quarter basis for the past two years are presented in item 5.-market-market information of this form 10-k. factors that could affect the price of our common stock in the future include general conditions in our industry, in the power markets in which we participate and in the world, including environmental and economic developments, over which we have no control, as well as developments specific to us, including, risks that could result in revenue and earnings volatility as well as other risk factors described in item 1a.-risk factors and those matters described in item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations.
risks associated with our operations we do a significant amount of business outside the u.s., including in developing countries, which presents significant risks.
a significant amount of our revenue is generated outside the u.s. and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in developing countries. part of our growth strategy is to expand our business in certain developing countries in which aes has an existing presence as such countries may have higher growth rates and offer greater opportunities to expand from our platforms, with potentially higher returns than in some more developed countries. international operations, particularly the operation, financing and development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:
•   economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region;
•   adverse changes in currency exchange rates;
•   government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;
•   unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies;
62
•   high inflation and monetary fluctuations;
•   restrictions on imports of coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate;
•   threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;
•   risks relating to the failure to comply with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, united kingdom bribery act or other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations;
•   difficulties in hiring, training and retaining qualified personnel, particularly finance and accounting personnel with gaap expertise;
•   unwillingness of governments and their agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their contracts;
•   unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to subsidiaries of the company and economically unfavorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private parties;
•   inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems;
•   adverse changes in government tax policy;
•   difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local jurisdictions; and
•   potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions.
any of these factors, by itself or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. our operations may experience volatility in revenues and operating margin which have caused and are expected to cause significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows. the volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability and currency devaluations being experienced in many of these countries. this volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses. a number of our businesses are facing challenges associated with regulatory changes.
the operation of power generation, distribution and transmission facilities involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial results. we and/or our subsidiaries may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage for liabilities.
we are in the business of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operating performance, including:
•   changes in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages, equipment failure, failure of transmission systems, labor disputes, disruptions in fuel supply, poor hydrologic and wind conditions, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, dam failures, explosions, terrorist acts, cyber attacks or other similar occurrences; and
•   changes in our operating cost structure including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to gas, coal, oil and other fuel; fuel transportation; purchased electricity; operations, maintenance and repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and capital expenditures to install environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance.
our businesses require reliable transportation sources (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports and rail), power sources and water sources to access and conduct operations. the availability and cost of this infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of production and sales. limitations, or interruptions in this infrastructure or at the facilities of our subsidiaries, including as a result of third parties intentionally or unintentionally disrupting this infrastructure or the facilities of our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce electricity. this could have a material adverse effect on our businesses' results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
in addition, a portion of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago. older generating equipment may require significant capital expenditures for maintenance. the equipment at our plants, whether old or new, is also likely to require periodic upgrading, improvement or repair, and replacement equipment or parts may be difficult to obtain in circumstances where we rely on a single supplier or a small number of suppliers. the inability to obtain replacement equipment or parts may impact the ability of our plants to perform and could, therefore, have a material impact on our business and results of operations. breakdown or failure of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of a power purchase or other agreement or incurrence of a liability for
63
liquidated damages and/or other penalties.
as a result of the above risks and other potential hazards associated with the power generation, distribution and transmission industries, we may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage. power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. in addition to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes and wind, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or actions of third parties or other external events. the control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans and specific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate, the possibility of the occurrence and impact of these risks.
the hazards described above, along with other safety hazards associated with our operations, can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. the occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and/or penalties. we maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. a claim for which we are not fully insured or insured at all could hurt our financial results and materially harm our financial condition. further, due to the cyclical nature of the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
our businesses' insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with its operations. adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not always obtainable. in addition, insurance may not fully cover the liability or the consequences of any business interruptions such as equipment failure or labor dispute. the occurrence of a significant adverse event not fully or partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results or operations, financial condition and prospects.
any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
our operating success and ability to carry out growth initiatives depends in part on our ability to retain executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel who have experience in our industry and in operating a company of our size and complexity, including people in our foreign businesses. the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements. for example, we routinely are required to assess the financial impacts of complicated business transactions which occur on a worldwide basis. these assessments are dependent on hiring personnel on a worldwide basis with sufficient expertise in u.s. gaap to timely and accurately comply with u.s. reporting obligations. an inability to maintain adequate internal accounting and managerial controls and hire and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our financial and tax reporting.
we have contractual obligations to certain customers to provide full requirements service, which makes it difficult to predict and plan for load requirements and may result in increased operating costs to certain of our businesses.
we have contractual obligations to certain customers to supply power to satisfy all or a portion of their energy requirements. the uncertainty regarding the amount of power that our power generation and distribution facilities must be prepared to supply to customers may increase our operating costs. a significant under- or over-estimation of load requirements could result in our facilities not having enough or having too much power to cover their obligations, in which case we would be required to buy or sell power from or to third parties at prevailing market prices. those prices may not be favorable and thus could increase our operating costs.
we may not be able to enter into long-term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. even when we successfully enter into long-term contracts, our generation businesses are often dependent on one or a limited number of customers and a limited number of fuel suppliers.
many of our generation plants conduct business under long-term sales and supply contracts, which helps these businesses to manage risks by reducing the volatility associated with power and input costs and providing a
64
stable revenue and cost structure. in these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant plant's output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract. the remaining terms of the power sales contracts of our generation plants range from one to 25 years. in many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering into long-term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. in these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are dependent on the continued ability of customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. some of our long-term power sales agreements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long-term fuel supply contracts are at prices below current market prices. the loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder, could adversely impact our strategy by resulting in costs that exceed revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, depending on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long-term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. the inability to enter into long-term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at market prices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable.
we have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long-term contracts in part by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or other customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from certain sovereign governments of the customer's obligations. however, many of our customers do not have, or have failed to maintain, an investment-grade credit rating, and our generation business cannot always obtain government guarantees and if they do, the government does not always have an investment grade credit rating. we have also sought to reduce our credit risk by locating our plants in different geographic areas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns. however, there can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate this risk will be successful.
competition is increasing and could adversely affect us.
the power production markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may have extensive and diversified developmental or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to or greater than ours. further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect to both obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets. in certain markets, these factors have caused reductions in prices contained in new power sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices. the evolution of competitive electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas-fired power plants have also caused, or are anticipated to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or intend to sell power. these competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on us.
some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significant contributions.
certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective employees. of the thirty one such defined benefit plans, five are at u.s. subsidiaries and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries. pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. the company periodically evaluates the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. the company's exposure to market volatility is mitigated to some extent due to the fact that the asset allocations in our largest plans include a significant weighting of investments in fixed income securities that are less volatile than investments in equity securities. future downturns in the debt and/or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries' pension plan obligations, could result in an increase in pension expense and future funding requirements, which may be material. our subsidiaries who participate in these plans are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdiction for any shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. this may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect the parent company and our subsidiaries' liquidity.
for additional information regarding the funding position of the company's pension plans, see item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-critical accounting policies and estimates-pension and other postretirement plans and note 15-benefit plans included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data included in this form 10-k.

our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties.
certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates are in various stages of developing and constructing power plants, some but not all of which have signed long-term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. successful completion depends upon overcoming substantial risks, including, but not limited to, risks relating to siting, financing, engineering and construction, permitting, governmental approvals, commissioning delays, or the potential for termination of the power sales contract as a result of a failure to meet certain milestones. for additional information regarding our projects under construction see item 1.-business-our organization and segments included in this form 10-k.
in certain cases, our subsidiaries may enter into obligations in the development process even though the subsidiaries have not yet secured financing, power purchase arrangements, or other aspects of the development process. for example, in certain cases, our subsidiaries may instruct contractors to begin the construction process or seek to procure equipment even where they do not have financing or a power purchase agreement in place (or conversely, to enter into a power purchase, procurement or other agreement without financing in place). if the project does not proceed, our subsidiaries may remain obligated for certain liabilities even though the project will not proceed. development is inherently uncertain and we may forgo certain development opportunities and we may undertake significant development costs before determining that we will not proceed with a particular project. we believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any individual project will be completed and reach commercial operation. if these development efforts are not successful, we may abandon a project under development and write off the costs incurred in connection with such project. at the time of abandonment, we would expense all capitalized development costs incurred in connection therewith and could incur additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities.
in some of our joint venture projects and businesses, we have granted protective rights to minority shareholders or we own less than a majority of the equity in the project or business and do not manage or otherwise control the project or business, which entails certain risks.
we have invested in some joint ventures where our subsidiaries share operational, management, investment and/or other control rights with our joint venture partners. in many cases, we may exert influence over the joint venture pursuant to a management contract, by holding positions on the board of the joint venture company or on management committees and/or through certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. however, we do not always have this type of influence over the project or business in every instance and we may be dependent on our joint venture partners or the management team of the joint venture to operate, manage, invest or otherwise control such projects or businesses. our joint venture partners or the management team of our joint ventures may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally, and they may not share our business priorities. in some joint venture agreements where we do have majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into shareholder agreements granting protective minority rights to the other shareholders.
the approval of joint venture partners also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from jointly owned entities or to transfer our interest in projects or businesses. the control or influence exerted by our joint venture partners may result in operational management and/or investment decisions which are different from the decisions our subsidiaries would make if they operated independently and could impact the profitability and value of these joint ventures. in addition, in the event that a joint venture partner becomes insolvent or bankrupt or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations to the joint venture or its share of liabilities at the joint venture, we may be subject to joint and several liability for these joint ventures, if and to the extent provided for in our governing documents or applicable law.
our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including, development, operational and regulatory challenges.
wind generation, our solar projects and our investments in projects such as energy storage are subject to substantial risks. projects of this nature have been developed through advancement in technologies which may not be proven or whose commercial application is limited, and which are unrelated to our core business. some of these business lines are dependent upon favorable regulatory incentives to support continued investment, and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which such favorable regulatory incentives will be available in the future.
furthermore, production levels for our wind and solar projects may be dependent upon adequate wind or sunlight resulting in volatility in production levels and profitability. for example, for our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when available and on wind resource studies conducted by an independent engineer, and are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any given year.
66
as a result, these types of renewable energy projects face considerable risk relative to our core business, including the risk that favorable regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. in addition, because certain of these projects depend on technology outside of our expertise in generation and utility businesses, there are risks associated with our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably. furthermore, at the development or acquisition stage, because of the nascent nature of these industries or the limited experience with the relevant technologies, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted. there are also risks associated with the fact that some of these projects exist in markets where long-term fixed price contracts for the major cost and revenue components may be unavailable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. even where available, many of our renewable projects sell power under a feed-in-tariff, which may be eliminated or reduced, which can impact the profitability of these projects, or make money through the sale of emission reductions products, such as certified emissions reductions, renewable energy certificates or renewable obligation certificates, and the price of these products may be volatile. these projects can be capital-intensive and generally are designed with a view to obtaining third party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. as a result, these capital constraints may reduce our ability to develop these projects or obtain third party financing for these projects.
impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.
as of december 31, 2016, the company had approximately $1.2 billion of goodwill, which represented approximately 3.2% of the total assets on its consolidated balance sheets. goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. we may be required to evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill outside of the required annual evaluation process if we experience situations, including but not limited to: deterioration in general economic conditions, or our operating or regulatory environment; increased competitive environment; increase in fuel costs, particularly when we are unable to pass through the impact to customers; negative or declining cash flows; loss of a key contract or customer, particularly when we are unable to replace it on equally favorable terms; divestiture of a significant component of our business; or adverse actions or assessments by a regulator. these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment, which could substantially affect our results of operations for those periods. additionally, goodwill may be impaired if our acquisitions do not perform as expected. see the risk factor our acquisitions may not perform as expected for further discussion.
long-lived assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives. long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment only when impairment indicators, similar to those described above for goodwill, are present, whereas goodwill is also evaluated for impairment on an annual basis.
certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather.
our businesses are affected by variations in general weather patterns and unusually severe weather. our businesses forecast electric sales on the basis of normal weather, which represents a long-term historical average. while we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns and potential impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter and summer. typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. significant variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations.
in addition, we are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which our hydroelectric generation facilities are located. if hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions that negatively affect our hydroelectric generation business, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
information security breaches could harm our business.
a security breach of our information technology systems or plant control systems used to manage and monitor operations could impact the reliability of our generation fleets and/or the reliability of our transmission and distribution systems. a security breach that impairs our technology infrastructure could disrupt normal business operations and affect our ability to control our transmission and distribution assets, access customer information and limit our communications with third parties. our security measures may not prevent such security breaches. any loss or corruption of confidential or proprietary data through a breach could impair our reputation, expose us to legal claims, or impact our ability to make collections or otherwise impact our operations, and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
67
our acquisitions may not perform as expected.
historically, acquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy. we may continue to grow our business through acquisitions. although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories, we will have a limited or no history of owning and operating many of these businesses and possibly limited or no experience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located. some of these businesses may have been government owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. if we were to acquire any of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that:
•   we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership;
•   such businesses will perform as expected;
•   integration or other one-time costs will not be greater than expected;
•   we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities;
•   such businesses will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them; or
•   the rate of return from such businesses will justify our decision to invest capital to acquire them.
risks associated with governmental regulation and laws our operations are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes.
our ability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any ability to obtain expected or contracted increases in electricity tariff or contract rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts' expectations. furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly at our utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to:
•   changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs to be included in the rates we charge our customers, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental regulations;
•   changes in the determination of what is an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or a determination that a utility's operating income or the rates it charges customers are too high, resulting in a reduction of rates or consumer rebates;
•   changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non-controllable costs;
•   adverse changes in tax law;
•   changes in law or regulation which limit or otherwise affect the ability of our counterparties (including sovereign or private parties) to fulfill their obligations (including payment obligations) to us or our subsidiaries;
•   changes in environmental law which impose additional costs or limit the dispatch of our generating facilities within our subsidiaries;
•   changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;
•   changes in the timing of tariff increases;
•   other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions;
•   other changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business; or
•   other changes that impact the short or long term price-setting mechanism in the markets where we operate.
any of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our business.
in many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing and it may be difficult to predict the impact of the regulations on our businesses. on july 21, 2010, president obama signed the dodd-frank act. while the bulk of regulations contained in the dodd-frank act regulate financial institutions and their products, there are several provisions related to corporate governance, executive compensation, disclosure and other matters which relate to public companies generally. the types of provisions described above are currently not expected to have a material impact on the company or its results of operations. furthermore, while the dodd-frank act substantially expands the regulation regarding the trading, clearing and reporting of derivative transactions, the dodd-frank act provides for commercial end-user exemptions which may apply to our derivative transactions. however, even with the exemption, the dodd-frank act could still have a material adverse impact on
68
the company, as the regulation of derivatives (which includes capital and margin requirements for non-exempt companies), could limit the availability of derivative transactions that we use to reduce interest rate, commodity and currency risks, which would increase our exposure to these risks. even if derivative transactions remain available, the costs to enter into these transactions may increase, which could adversely (1) affect the operating results of certain projects; (2) cause us to default on certain types of contracts where we are contractually obligated to hedge certain risks, such as project financing agreements; (3) prevent us from developing new projects where interest rate hedging is required; (4) cause the company to abandon certain of its hedging strategies and transactions, thereby increasing our exposure to interest rate, commodity and currency risk; (5) and/or consume substantial liquidity by forcing the company to post cash and/or other permitted collateral in support of these derivatives. in addition to the dodd-frank act, in 2012, the emir became effective. emir includes regulations related to the trading, reporting and clearing of derivatives and the impacts described above could also result from our (or our subsidiaries') efforts to comply with emir. it is also possible that additional similar regulations may be passed in other jurisdictions where we conduct business. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the company.
our business in the united states is subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered in whole or in part by the ferc and nerc, including purpa, the federal power act, and the epact 2005. actions by the ferc, nerc and by state utility commissions can have a material effect on our operations.
epact 2005 authorizes the ferc to remove the obligation of electric utilities under section 210 of purpa to enter into new contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity from or to qfs if certain market conditions are met. pursuant to this authority, the ferc has instituted a rebuttable presumption that utilities located within the control areas of the midwest independent transmission system operator, inc., pjm interconnection, l.l.c., iso new england, inc., the nyiso and the electric reliability council of texas, inc. are not required to purchase or sell power from or to qfs above a certain size. in addition, the ferc is authorized under epact 2005 to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a case-by-case basis. while this law does not affect existing contracts, as a result of the changes to purpa, our qfs may face a more difficult market environment when their current long-term contracts expire.
epact 2005 repealed puhca 1935 and enacted puhca 2005 in its place. puhca 1935 had the effect of requiring utility holding companies to operate in geographically proximate regions and therefore limited the range of potential combinations and mergers among utilities. by comparison, puhca 2005 has no such restrictions and simply provides the ferc and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. the repeal of puhca 1935 removed barriers to mergers and other potential combinations which could result in the creation of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies. these entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the u.s. generation market.
in accordance with congressional mandates in the epact 1992 and now in epact 2005, the ferc has strongly encouraged competition in wholesale electric markets. increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins. among other steps, the ferc has encouraged rtos and isos to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. these programs may reduce the value of our peaking assets which rely on very high prices during a relatively small number of hours to recover their costs. similarly, the ferc is encouraging the construction of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of epact 2005. although new transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also increase the competition in our existing markets.
while the ferc continues to promote competition, some state utility commissions have reversed course and begun to encourage the construction of generation facilities by traditional utilities to be paid for on a cost-of-service basis by retail ratepayers. such actions have the effect of reducing sale opportunities in the competitive wholesale generating markets in which we operate.
ferc has civil penalty authority over violations of any provision of part ii of the fpa which concerns wholesale generation or transmission, as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. ferc is authorized to assess a maximum civil penalty of $1 million per violation for each day that the violation continues. the fpa also provides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under the fpa. this penalty authority was enhanced in epact 2005. with this expanded enforcement authority, violations of the fpa and ferc's regulations could potentially have more serious consequences than in the past.
pursuant to epact 2005, the nerc has been certified by ferc as the electric reliability organization ("ero") to develop mandatory and enforceable electric system reliability standards applicable throughout the u.s. to improve the overall reliability of the electric grid. these standards are subject to ferc review and approval.
69
once approved, the reliability standards may be enforced by ferc independently, or, alternatively, by the ero and regional reliability organizations with responsibility for auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to ferc oversight. monetary penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation may be assessed for violations of the reliability standards.
our utility businesses in the u.s. face significant regulation by their respective state utility commissions. the regulatory discretion is reasonably broad in both indiana and ohio and includes regulation as to services and facilities, the valuation of property, the construction, purchase, or lease of electric generating facilities, the classification of accounts, rates of depreciation, the increase or decrease in retail rates and charges, the issuance of certain securities, the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities and certain other matters. these businesses face the risk of unexpected or adverse regulatory action which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. see item 1.-business-us sbu-u.s. businesses-u.s. utilities for further information on the regulation faced by our u.s. utilities.
our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations.
our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, international treaties and foreign governmental authorities. these laws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation, among others. failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain or comply with any necessary environmental permits pursuant to such laws and regulations could result in fines or other sanctions. environmental laws and regulations affecting power generation and distribution are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air emissions and water discharges. see the various descriptions of these laws and regulations contained in item 1.-business of this form 10-k. these laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. we have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. changes in, or new development of, environmental restrictions may force the company to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial condition, including recorded asset values or results of operations, would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in domestic or foreign environmental laws and regulations.
our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies.
the epa has pursued an enforcement initiative against coal-fired generating plants alleging wide-spread violations of the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the caa. the epa has brought suit against a number of companies and has obtained settlements with many of these companies over such allegations. the allegations typically involve claims that a company made major modifications to a coal-fired generating unit without proper permit approval and without installing best available control technology. the principal, but not exclusive, focus of this epa enforcement initiative is emissions of so2 and nox. in connection with this enforcement initiative, the epa has imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce emissions of so2 and nox. there can be no assurance that foreign environmental regulatory agencies in countries in which our subsidiaries operate will not pursue similar enforcement initiatives under relevant laws and regulations.
regulators, politicians, non-governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or ghg, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
as discussed in item 1.-business, at the international, federal and various regional and state levels, rules are in effect and policies are under development to regulate ghg emissions, thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to create financial incentives to reduce them. in 2016, the company's subsidiaries operated businesses which had total co2 emissions of approximately 67.7 million metric tonnes, approximately 30.2 million of which were emitted by businesses located in the u.s. (both figures ownership adjusted). the company uses co2 emission estimation methodologies supported by "the greenhouse gas protocol" reporting standard on ghg emissions. for existing power generation plants, co2 emissions data are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type co2 emission factors. the estimated annual co2 emissions from fossil fuel electric power generation facilities of the company's
70
subsidiaries that are in construction or development and have received the necessary air permits for commercial operations are approximately 7.7 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). this overall estimate is based on a number of projections and assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, such as the forecasted dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, co2 emissions rates and our subsidiaries' achieving completion of such construction and development projects. however, it is certain that the projects under construction or development when completed will increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks associated with regulation of ghg emissions. because there is significant uncertainty regarding these estimates, actual emissions from these projects under construction or development may vary substantially from these estimates.
the non-utility, generation subsidiaries of the company often seek to pass on any costs arising from co2 emissions to contract counterparties, but there can be no assurance that such subsidiaries of the company will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or that the cost and burden associated with any dispute over which party bears such costs would not be burdensome and costly to the relevant subsidiaries of the company. the utility subsidiaries of the company may seek to pass on any costs arising from co2 emissions to customers, but there can be no assurance that such subsidiaries of the company will effectively pass such costs to the customers, or that they will be able to fully or timely recover such costs.
foreign, federal, state or regional regulation of ghg emissions could have a material adverse impact on the company's financial performance. the actual impact on the company's financial performance and the financial performance of the company's subsidiaries will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the degree and timing of ghg emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulation, the cost of emissions reduction equipment and the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive ghg emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. as a result of these factors, our cost of compliance could be substantial and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
in january 2005, based on european community "directive 2003/87/ec on greenhouse gas emission allowance trading," the eu ets commenced operation as the largest multi-country ghg emission trading scheme in the world. on february 16, 2005, the kyoto protocol became effective. the kyoto protocol requires all developed countries that have ratified it to substantially reduce their ghg emissions, including co2. however, the united states never ratified the kyoto protocol and, to date, compliance with the kyoto protocol and the eu ets has not had a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
in december 2015, the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change ("unfccc") convened for the 21st conference of the parties in paris, france. the result was the so-called paris agreement. the paris agreement has a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°c above pre-industrial levels. in furtherance of this goal, participating countries submitted comprehensive national climate action plans and have agreed to meet every five years to set more ambitious targets as required by science, to report to each other and the public on how well they are doing to implement their targets and to track progress towards the long-term goal through a robust transparency and accountability system. we anticipate that the paris agreement will continue the trend towards the efforts to de-carbonize the global economy and to further limit ghg emissions, including in those countries where the company does business. it is difficult to predict the nature, timing and scope of such regulation but it could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial performance.
in the u.s., there currently is no federal legislation imposing a mandatory ghg emission reduction programs (including for co2) affecting the electric power generation facilities of the company's subsidiaries. however, the epa has adopted regulations pertaining to ghg emissions that require new sources of ghg emissions of over 100,000 tons per year, and existing sources planning physical changes that would increase their ghg emissions by more than 75,000 tons per year, to obtain new source review permits from the epa prior to construction or modification. additionally, the epa has promulgated a rule establishing new source performance standards for co2 emissions for newly constructed and modified/reconstructed fossil-fueled eusgus larger than 25 mw. the epa has also promulgated a rule, the cpp, which requires existing eusgus to begin reducing ghg emissions starting in 2022 with the full reduction requirement in 2030. under the cpp, states are required to develop and submit plans that establish performance standards or, through emissions trading programs, otherwise meet a state-wide emissions rate average or mass-based goal. for further discussion of the regulation of ghg emission, including the u.s. supreme court's issued an order staying implementation of the cpp, see item 1.-business-environmental and land-use regulations-united states environmental and land-use legislation and regulations-greenhouse gas emissions above.
71
such regulations, and in particular regulations applying to modified or existing eusgus, could increase our costs directly and indirectly and have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations. see item 1.-business of this form 10-k for further discussion about these environmental agreements, laws and regulations.
at the state level, the rggi, a cap-and-trade program covering co2 emissions from electric power generation facilities in the northeast, became effective in january 2009, and california has adopted comprehensive legislation and regulation that requires ghg reductions from multiple industrial sectors, including the electric power generation industry. at this time, other than with regard to rggi (further described below) and proposed hawaii regulations relating to the collection of fees on ghg emissions, the impact of both of which we do not expect to be material, the company cannot estimate the costs of compliance with u.s. federal, regional or state ghg emissions reduction legislation or initiatives, due to the fact that most of these proposals are not being actively pursued or are in the early stages of development and any final regulations or laws, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals; in the case of california, we anticipate no material impact due to the fact that we expect such costs will be passed through to our offtakers under the terms of existing tolling agreements.
the auctions of rggi allowances needed by power generators to comply with state programs implementing rggi occur approximately every quarter. our subsidiary in maryland is our only subsidiary that was subject to rggi in 2016. of the approximately 30.2 million metric tonnes of co2 emitted in the united states by our subsidiaries in 2016 (ownership adjusted), approximately 1.1 million metric tonnes were emitted by our subsidiary in maryland. the company estimates that the rggi compliance costs could be approximately $3.2 million for 2017. there is a risk that our actual compliance costs under rggi will differ from our estimates by a material amount and that our model could underestimate our costs of compliance.
in addition to government regulators, other groups such as politicians, environmentalists and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about ghg emissions. for example, certain financial institutions have expressed concern about providing financing for facilities which would emit ghgs, which can affect our ability to obtain capital, or if we can obtain capital, to receive it on commercially viable terms. further, rating agencies may decide to downgrade our credit ratings based on the emissions of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries or increased compliance costs which could make financing unattractive. in addition, plaintiffs have brought tort lawsuits against the company because of its subsidiaries' ghg emissions. while the litigation mentioned has been dismissed, it is impossible to predict whether similar future lawsuits are likely to prevail or result in damages awards or other relief. consequently, it is impossible to determine whether such lawsuits are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
furthermore, according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow-fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea level, changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect the company's business and operations, and any such potential impact may render it more difficult for our businesses to obtain financing. for example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at the electric power generation facilities and support facilities of the company's subsidiaries. variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity also would be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. a decrease in energy consumption could decrease the revenues of the company's subsidiaries. in addition, while revenues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers and changes in precipitation that result in drought could adversely affect the operations of the fossil fuel-fired electric power generation facilities of the company's subsidiaries. changes in temperature, precipitation and snow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation.
in addition to potential physical risks noted by the intergovernmental panel on climate change, there could be damage to the reputation of the company and its subsidiaries due to public perception of ghg emissions by the company's subsidiaries, and any such negative public perception or concerns could ultimately result in a decreased demand for electric power generation or distribution from our subsidiaries. the level of ghg emissions made by subsidiaries of the company is not a factor in the compensation of executives of the company.
if any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on the electric power generation businesses of the company's subsidiaries and on the company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
72
tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
our subsidiaries have operations in the u.s. and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. as such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the u.s. federal, state and local governments and of many non-u.s. jurisdictions. from time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax positions regarding income or other taxes. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these legislative measures.
for example, the u.s. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly change corporate tax rates, business rules such as interest deductibility and capital expenditure cost recovery, and u.s. international tax rules. additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine how and where cross-border international trade is subjected to tax are evolving. the organization for economic cooperation and development ("oecd"), in coordination with the g8 and g20, through its base erosion and profit shifting project ("beps") introduced a series of recommendations that many tax jurisdictions have adopted, or may adopt in the future, as law. as these and other tax laws, related regulations and double-tax conventions change, our financial results could be materially impacted. given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our results of operations.
in addition, u.s. federal, state and local, as well as non-u.s., tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. there can be no assurance that our tax positions will be sustained if challenged by relevant tax authorities and if not sustained, there could be a material impact on our results of operations.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations key topics in management's discussion and analysis our discussion covers the following:
•   executive summary
•   overview of 2016 results and strategic performance
•   review of consolidated results of operations
•   sbu performance analysis
•   key trends and uncertainties
•   capital resources and liquidity executive summary consolidated net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $2,884 million, an increase of $750 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily driven by higher collections at the company's distribution business in brazil, eletropaulo and sul, and the settlement of overdue receivables at maritza in bulgaria. these positive contributions were offset by lower margins across the sbus (primarily due to lower wholesale prices and lower contributions from regulated customers in the u.s., lower contracted rates in tietê, the prior year liability reversal in eletropaulo and unfavorable fx in kazakhstan), as well as the recovery of overdue receivables in the dominican republic in 2015, which benefited

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased primarily due to higher impairment expense on long lived assets, lower gains on foreign currency derivatives, lower operating margins at our us, brazil and europe sbus, and lower equity in earnings of affiliates due to the gain earned in 2015 from the restructuring of guacolda; partially offset by a lower effective tax rate, the absence of goodwill impairment expense in the current year, lower losses on extinguishment of debt and lower share count.
adjusted eps, a non-gaap measure, decreased by 22% to $0.98 primarily driven by lower operating margins at our us, brazil, and europe sbus, lower equity in earnings of affiliates due to the gain earned in 2015 from the restructuring of guacolda; partially offset by a lower adjusted effective tax rate and lower share count.
net cash provided by operating activities increased by 35% to $2.9 billion primarily driven by an increase in collections at our brazil utilities, the collection of overdue receivables at maritza, and lower costs associated with the fulfillment of our service concession arrangement and lower working capital requirements at mong duong. these positive impacts were partially offset by the timing of payments at our brazil utilities for higher energy purchases made in the prior year, collections of overdue receivables in the prior year in the dominican republic, and lower net income adjusted for non-cash items.
proportional free cash flow, a non-gaap measure, increased by 14% to $1.4 billion primarily driven by an increase in collections at our brazil utilities, the collection of overdue receivables at maritza, and lower working capital requirements at mong duong. these positive impacts were partially offset by the timing of payments at our brazil utilities for higher energy purchases made in the prior year, collections of overdue receivables in the prior year in the dominican republic, and a decrease in adjusted operating margin (a non-gaap measure).

consolidated revenue and operating margin
(in millions)
year ended december 31, 2016
consolidated revenue - revenue decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to:
•   unfavorable fx impacts of $511 million, primarily in brazil of $213 million, argentina of $94 million, kazakhstan of $63 million and colombia of $54 million.
•   brazil due to lower rates for energy sold in brazil under new contracts at tietê; operations in 2015 but not in 2016 at uruguiana; the reversal of a contingent regulatory liability in 2015, and lower demand, partially offset by the annual tariff adjustment at eletropaulo.
•   lower pass-through costs at el salvador and ipp4 in jordan, the sale of dpler in january 2016, and lower rates at dpl.
these decreases were partially offset by:
•   the full operations at mong duong in 2016 compared to unit 1 in march 2015 with principal operations commencing in april 2015
•   the commencement of operations at cochrane in chile with unit 1 operational in july 2016 and principal operations in october).
•   higher environmental returns and new rate case at ipl.
consolidated operating margin - operating margin decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to:
•   unfavorable fx impacts of $80 million, primarily in kazakhstan, argentina, and colombia.
•   brazil driven by the revenue drivers above as well as higher fixed costs at eletropaulo.
these decreases were partially offset by:
•   higher margin at gener, impact from full operations at mong duong in vietnam and cochrane in chile, and higher margins at ipl as discussed above.
year ended december 31, 2015
consolidated revenue - revenue decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to:
•   unfavorable fx impacts of $2.2 billion, mainly in brazil of $1.8 billion, colombia of $179 million, and bulgaria of $74 million.
•   us utilities due to lower volumes primarily at dpl and outages, milder weather, and lower demand at ipl.
•   lower prices in the dominican republic and el salvador (primarily resulting from lower pass-through costs).
these decreases were partially offset by:
•   brazil due to higher tariffs at eletropaulo (including higher pass-through costs) and the reversal of a contingent regulatory liability at eletropaulo.
•   higher capacity prices at dpl.
•   commencement of principal operations at mong duong in april 2015.
83
consolidated operating margin - operating margin decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to:
•   unfavorable fx impacts of $362 million, primarily in brazil of $228 million and colombia of $83 million.
•   brazil due to lower demand, lower hydrology, and higher fixed costs.
•   the dominican republic due to lower prices and lower availability.
these decreases were partially offset by:
•   higher tariffs in brazil as discussed above and lower spot prices on energy purchases at tietê.
•   higher generation and lower energy purchases driven by improved hydrological conditions in panama.
•   higher prices at chivor driven by a strong el niño.
•   higher availability at gener and masinloc.
see item 7.-sbu performance analysis of this form 10-k for additional discussion and analysis of operating results for each sbu.
consolidated results of operations - other general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include expenses related to corporate staff functions and/or initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, human resources and information systems, as well as global development costs.
general and administrative expenses decreased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to decreased employee-related costs, partially offset by increased business development costs.
general and administrative expenses increased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to increased business development costs and employee-related costs partially offset by decreased professional fees.
interest expense interest expense increased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to a $97 million increase at eletropaulo as a result of the prior year reversal of $64 million in interest expense, previously recognized on a contingent regulatory liability, and increased interest expense due to higher regulatory liabilities and interest rates in the current year. additionally, there was a $26 million increase at mong duong, mainly due to this entity no longer capitalizing interest as a result of the commencement of operations in april 2015. these increases were partially offset by lower interest expense of $22 million due to a reduction in debt principal at the parent company.
interest expense decreased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to lower interest expense of $63 million at the parent company due to a reduction in debt principal, and a $64 million reversal of interest expense previously recognized on a contingent regulatory liability at eletropaulo. these decreases were partially offset by an increase at mong duong as the plant commenced operations in april 2015 and ceased capitalizing interest.
interest income interest income increased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to higher interest income of $19 million recognized on the financing element of the service concession arrangement at mong duong, which became fully operational in april 2015, partially offset by lower interest income of $16 million in argentina due to prior year recognition of accumulated interest on vat balances related to camessa.
interest income increased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to interest income of $114 million recognized in 2015 on the financing element of the service concession arrangement at muong duong, as well as an increase of $36 million at eletropaulo resulting from higher interest rates and an increase in regulatory assets.
loss on extinguishment of debt loss on extinguishment of debt was $13 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily related to expense of $14 million recognized on debt extinguishment at the parent company.
loss on extinguishment of debt was $182 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. this loss was primarily related to expense of $105 million, $22 million, and $19 million recognized on debt extinguishments at the parent company, ipl, and the dominican republic, respectively.
loss on extinguishment of debt was $261 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this was primarily related to expense of $193 million, $31 million, and $20 million recognized on debt extinguishments at the parent
84
company, dpl, and gener, respectively.
other income and expense other income decreased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to gains on early contract termination in 2015 and lower gains on asset sales in 2016; partially offset by an increase in allowance for funds used during construction as a result of increased construction activity at ipl.
other income decreased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to lower gains on asset sales in 2015 and the 2014 reversal of a liability in kazakhstan due to the expiration of a statute of limitations for the republic of kazakhstan to claim payment from aes.
other expense increased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to the 2016 recognition a full allowance on a non-trade receivable in the mcac sbu as a result of payment delays and discussions with the counterparty. the allowance relates to certain reimbursements the company was expecting in connection with a legal matter. management believes the counterparty is obligated to pay and plans to continue to attempt to fully collect the non-trade receivable.
other expense decreased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to lower losses on sales and disposal of assets at termo andes and eletropaulo.
see note 19-other income and expense included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
gain on disposal and sale of businesses gain on sale of businesses was $29 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, which was primarily related to the gain on sale of dpler, partially offset by a loss on the deconsolidation of u.k. wind.

gain on disposal and sale of investments for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $358 million, which was primarily related to the sale of 45% of the company's interest in masinloc, as well as the sale of u.k. wind (operating projects).
goodwill impairment expense there were no goodwill impairments for the year ended december 31, 2016.
goodwill impairment expense was $317 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 due to a goodwill impairment at dp&l.
goodwill impairment expense was $164 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this expense consisted of $136 million, $20 million and $8 million of goodwill impairments at dpler, buffalo gap ii and buffalo gap i, respectively.
see note 9-goodwill and other intangible assets included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
asset impairment expense asset impairment expense was $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016. this was primarily related to asset impairments of $859 million, $159 million and $77 million at dpl, buffalo gap ii and buffalo gap i, respectively.
asset impairment expense was $285 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily due to asset impairments of $121 million, $116 million and $37 million at kilroot, buffalo gap iii and u.k. wind, respectively.

see note 20-asset impairment expense included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
income tax expense income tax decreased to a benefit of $188 million in 2016 as compared to expense of $472 million in 2015. the company's effective tax rates were (137%) and 41% for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
85
the net decrease in the 2016 effective tax rate was due, in part, to the 2016 asset impairments in the u.s. and to the current year benefit related to a restructuring of one of our brazilian businesses that increases tax basis in long-term assets. further, the 2015 rate was impacted by the items described below. see note 20-asset impairment expense for additional information regarding the 2016 u.s. asset impairments.
income tax expense increased $101 million, or 27%, to $472 million in 2015. the company's effective tax rates were 41% and 26% for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the net increase in the 2015 effective tax rate was due, in part, to the nondeductible 2015 impairment of goodwill at our u.s. utility, dp&l and chilean withholding taxes offset by the release of valuation allowance at certain of our businesses in brazil, vietnam and the u.s. further, the 2014 rate was impacted by the sale of approximately 45% of the company's interest in masin aes pte ltd., which owns the company's business interests in the philippines and the 2014 sale of the company's interests in four u.k. wind operating projects. neither of these transactions gave rise to income tax expense. see note 15-equity for additional information regarding the sale of approximately 45% of the company's interest in masin-aes pte ltd. see note 23-dispositions for additional information regarding the sale of the company's interests in four u.k. wind operating projects.
our effective tax rate reflects the tax effect of significant operations outside the u.s., which are generally taxed at rates lower than the u.s. statutory rate of 35%. a future proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions could impact our periodic effective tax rate. the company also benefits from reduced tax rates in certain countries as a result of satisfying specific commitments regarding employment and capital investment. see note 21-income taxes for additional information regarding these reduced rates.

sbu performance analysis non-gaap measures adjusted operating margin, adjusted ptc, adjusted eps, and proportional free cash flow are non-gaap supplemental measures that are used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as investors, industry analysts and lenders.
adjusted operating margin we define adjusted operating margin as operating margin, adjusted for the impact of nci, excluding unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions. see review of consolidated results of operations for definitions of operating margin and cost of sales.
the gaap measure most comparable to adjusted operating margin is operating margin. we believe that adjusted operating margin better reflects the underlying business performance of the company. factors in this determination include the impact of nci, where aes consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly owned by the company, as well as the variability due to unrealized derivatives gains or losses. adjusted operating margin should not be construed as an alternative to operating margin, which is determined in accordance with gaap.

adjusted ptc we define adjusted ptc as pretax income from continuing operations attributable to the aes corporation excluding gains or losses due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. adjusted ptc also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities.
adjusted ptc reflects the impact of nci and excludes the items specified in the definition above. in addition to the revenue and cost of sales reflected in operating margin, adjusted ptc includes the other components of our income statement, such as general and administrative expense in the corporate segment, as well as business development costs; interest expense and interest income; other expense and other income; realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses; and net equity in earnings of affiliates.
the gaap measure most comparable to adjusted ptc is income from continuing operations attributable to the aes corporation. we believe that adjusted ptc better reflects the underlying business performance of the company and is considered in the company's internal evaluation of financial performance. factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. in addition, earnings before tax represents the business performance of the company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the company operates. adjusted ptc should not be construed as an alternative to income from continuing operations attributable to the aes corporation, which is determined in accordance with gaap.

adjusted eps we define adjusted eps as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt.
the gaap measure most comparable to adjusted eps is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. we believe that adjusted eps better reflects the underlying business performance of the company and is considered in the company's internal evaluation of financial performance. factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. adjusted eps should not be construed as an alternative to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which is determined in accordance with gaap.

proportional free cash flow we define proportional free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures (including non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures), adjusted for the estimated impact of noncontrolling interests. the proportionate share of cash flows and related adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries comprise the proportional adjustment factor presented in the reconciliation below. upon the company's adoption of the accounting guidance for service concession arrangements effective january 1, 2015, capital expenditures related to service concession assets that would have been classified as investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows are now classified as operating activities. see note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies of this form 10-k for further information on the adoption of this guidance.
beginning in the quarter ended march 31, 2015, the company changed the definition of proportional free cash flow to exclude the cash flows for capital expenditures related to service concession assets that are now classified within net cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows. the proportional adjustment factor for these capital expenditures is presented in the reconciliation below.
we also exclude environmental capital expenditures that are expected to be recovered through regulatory, contractual or other mechanisms. an example of recoverable environmental capital expenditures is ipl's investment in mats-related environmental upgrades that are recovered through a tracker. see item 1.-us sbu-ipl-environmental matters for details of these investments.
the gaap measure most comparable to proportional free cash flow is cash flows from operating activities. we believe that proportional free cash flow better reflects the underlying business performance of the company, as it measures the cash generated by the business, after the funding of maintenance capital expenditures, that may be available for investing in growth opportunities or repaying debt. factors in this determination include the impact of noncontrolling interests, where aes consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the company.

the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. proportional free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to cash from operating activities, which is determined in accordance with gaap. proportional free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary payments because it excludes certain payments that are required or to which we have committed, such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. our definition of proportional free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we will no longer include these non-gaap proportional free cash flow disclosures that have historically been provided and will instead disclose non-gaap free cash flows only on a consolidated basis. our use of proportional free cash flow was intended to provide investors with an understanding of the portion of free cash flows attributable to aes after the impact of non-controlling interests. however, since the concept of a non-controlling interest is not contemplated under gaap with respect to the statement of cash flows, we will no longer be able to disclose proportional free cash flow in light of recent interpretive guidance issued by the sec staff.

(1)   service concession asset expenditures are excluded from the proportional free cash flow non-gaap metric.
(2)   the proportional adjustment factor, proportional maintenance capital expenditures (net of reinsurance proceeds) and proportional non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures are calculated by multiplying the percentage owned by noncontrolling interests for each entity by its corresponding consolidated cash flow metric and are totaled to the resulting figures. for example, parent company a owns 20% of subsidiary company b, a consolidated subsidiary. thus, subsidiary company b has an 80% noncontrolling interest. assuming a consolidated net cash flow from operating activities of $100 from subsidiary b, the proportional adjustment factor for subsidiary b would equal $80 (or $100 x 80%). the company calculates the proportional adjustment factor for each consolidated business in this manner and then sums these amounts to determine the total proportional adjustment factor used in the reconciliation. the proportional adjustment factor may differ from the proportion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of (a) non-cash items which impact income but not cash and (b) aes' ownership interest in the subsidiary where such items occur.
(3)   includes proportional adjustment amount for service concession asset expenditures of $15 million and $84 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the company adopted service concession accounting effective january 1, 2015.
(4)   excludes ipl's proportional recoverable environmental capital expenditures of $132 million, $205 million and $163 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

parent free cash flow (a non-gaap measure)
the company defines parent free cash flow as dividends and other distributions received from our operating businesses less certain cash costs at the parent company level, primarily interest payments, overhead, and development costs. parent free cash flow is used to fund shareholder dividends, share repurchases, growth investments, recourse debt repayments, and other uses by the parent company. refer to item 1-business-overview for further discussion of the parent company's capital allocation strategy.

adjusted operating margin decreased $85 million for the us sbu due to the drivers above, excluding the impact of unrealized derivative gains and losses and adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests.
adjusted ptc decreased $13 million driven by the decrease of $85 million in adjusted operating margin described above, partially offset by a gain on contract termination at dp&l, lower interest expense at dpl and ipl in part due to the sell-down impacts as discussed above and the impact of hlbv at our distributed energy business as a result of new projects achieving cod in 2016.
proportional free cash flow increased $23 million, primarily driven by a $93 million decrease in coal purchases due to the ongoing conversion of coal generation assets to natural gas at ipl, a build-up of inventory due to mild winter weather in december 2015, and inventory optimization efforts at dpl. additionally, proportional free cash flow benefited from a $32 million increase in accounts payable due to the timing of vendor payments, $17 million in net settlements of accounts receivable primarily resulting from the sale of dpler in 2016, and lower interest payments of $19 million due to timing and lower interest rates. these positive impacts were partially offset by an $81 million decrease in adjusted operating margin (net of non-cash impacts of $4 million, primarily related to the implementation of ipl's new rates and depreciation), and a $84 million decrease in the timing of receivables collections resulting primarily from higher rates at ipl, more favorable weather in 2016, and the impact of dpler's declining customer base in 2015.
fiscal year 2015 versus 2014
operating margin decreased by $78 million, or 11%, which was driven primarily by the following:
dpl impact of more of dp&amp;l's generation being sold in the wholesale market at lower prices in 2015 compared to supplying dp&amp;l retail customers in 2014, lower generation driven by plant outages in 2015, and unfavorable weather; partially offset by the impact of outages and lower gas availability occurring in q1 2014      $(53   )

adjusted operating margin decreased $24 million for the year due to the drivers above, adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests.
adjusted ptc decreased $92 million, driven by the decrease in equity earnings of $54 million mainly related to guacolda's reorganization in september 2015, the decrease of $24 million in adjusted operating margin and the increase of $12 million in interest expense primarily associated to lower interest capitalization after beginning of commercial operations at cochrane.
proportional free cash flow increased $40 million, primarily driven by $57 million in collections of financing receivables and the timing of maintenance remuneration from cammessa in argentina, a $25 million positive impact related to a one-time interest rate swap termination payment at ventanas in july 2015, a decrease of $58 million in working capital requirements at chivor mainly related to collections of prior period sales, and a $23 million reduction in proportional maintenance and non-recoverable capital expenditures due to lower expenditures on

emissions control equipment at chile. these positive impacts were partially offset by a reduction of $4 million in adjusted operating margin (net of non-cash impacts), $43 million of lower vat refunds related to our cochrane and alto maipo construction projects, higher net tax payments of $56 million primarily related to withholding taxes paid on chilean distributions to aes affiliates and higher taxable income in colombia, and $18 million of higher interest payments primarily as a consequence of debt refinancing at higher interest rates and lower interest capitalization under construction projects.

adjusted operating margin increased $22 million for the year due to the drivers above, adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests.
adjusted ptc increased $61 million driven by a restructuring of guacolda in chile which increased our equity investment and resulted in additional equity earnings of $46 million as well as realized fx gains, lower interest expense at chivor and the $22 million in adjusted operating margin described above. this was partially offset by lower equity earnings at guacolda of $16 million (excluding restructuring impact above) mainly driven by a 2014 gain on sale of a transmission line.
proportional free cash flow increased $48 million, primarily driven by $107 million higher vat refunds at cochrane and alto maipo, $27 million of non-recurring maintenance collections in argentina, and a $17 million decrease in interest payments. these positive impacts were partially offset by $49 million of higher tax payments and $25 million of lower collections primarily from contract customers at chivor, and a $25 million impact related to a one-time interest rate swap termination payment at ventanas in july 2015.

adjusted operating margin decreased $44 million due to the drivers above adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests and excluding unrealized gains and losses on derivatives.
adjusted ptc decreased $25 million, driven by the decrease in adjusted operating margin of $44 million described above. these results were partially offset by a compensation agreement regarding early termination of the original barge ppa of $10 million and 2014 losses on a legal dispute settlement of $4 million in panama as well as lower interest expense due to lower debt at puerto rico.
proportional free cash flow increased $217 million, primarily due to the favorable timing of $220 million of collections, mainly related to the collection of overdue receivables in the dominican republic in september 2015. proportional free cash flow also benefited from a $17 million impact of lower energy purchases in el salvador due to lower fuel prices, and a $10 million impact from compensation received from the off-taker in panama related to an early termination of the barge ppa. these favorable impacts were partially offset by the $44 million decrease in adjusted operating margin as described above.

adjusted operating margin increased $19 million due to the drivers above adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests.
adjusted ptc increased $50 million, driven by the increase of $19 million in adjusted operating margin described above, and the additional net impact of $28 million at mong duong due to a component of service concession revenue recognized as interest income, net of higher interest expense as interest is no longer capitalized. see note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies in part ii.-item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding the accounting for service concession arrangements.
proportional free cash flow increased $5 million, primarily driven by an increase in adjusted operating margin of $28 million (net of $9 million in non-cash items, primarily service concession expense and the
102
retrospective adjustment to energy prices noted above), and $58 million in higher interest income recognized at mong duong as a result of the financing component under service concession accounting. these positive impacts were partially offset by $26 million in higher working capital requirements at mong duong due to a build-up in preparation of the commencement of operations, $22 million in higher interest payments at mong duong, $11 million of higher tax payments at masinloc, and $9 million in higher working capital requirements at masinloc due primarily to the timing of coal purchases.
key trends and uncertainties during 2017 and beyond, we expect to face the following challenges at certain of our businesses. management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses, growth from new businesses and global cost reduction initiatives may lessen or offset their impact. if these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move more unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may impact our operating margin, net income attributable to the aes corporation and cash flows. we continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. for the risk factors related to our business, see item 1.-business and item 1a.-risk factors of this form 10-k.
macroeconomic and political during 2016, the political environments in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have changed which could result in significant impacts to tax laws, and environmental and energy policies. additionally, we operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at the subsidiary level. see item 7a.-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further information.
brazil - president michel temer, with majority congressional support, continues to implement the fiscal reforms needed to improve the country's finances. while uncertainty dominates the political arena, if enacted, president temer's market reforms would improve the the economic outlook, which may benefit our businesses in brazil.
in october 2016, aes completed the sale of the company's 100% ownership interest in aes sul and recognized an after-tax loss on disposal of $737 million. this after-tax loss excludes the impact of contingent proceeds linked to the favorable settlement of pending litigation, which is not guaranteed. if the case is decided in the company's favor, amounts would be remitted to aes over an unknown period of time. any potential gain from the eventual resolution of this contingency would be presented separately as discontinued operations.
united kingdom - on june 23, 2016, the united kingdom (u.k.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union ("e.u."), commonly referred to as "brexit". as a result of the referendum, it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the u.k.'s future relationship with the e.u. although it is unclear what the long-term global implications will be, it is possible that the european or u.k. economy could weaken and our businesses may experience a decline in demand. while the full impact of the brexit is uncertain, these changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results. the most immediate impact has been a devaluation of the pound and euro against the u.s. dollar. for 2016 and 2017, the company has hedged against these foreign currency movements, however, the impact could be greater in future years.
puerto rico - our subsidiaries in puerto rico have long term ppas with state-owned prepa. due to the ongoing economic situation in the territory, prepa faces significant financial challenges. there have been no significant adverse impacts to aes puerto rico due to prepa's financial challenges.
if prepa continues to face challenges, or those challenges worsen, or otherwise impact prepa's ability to make payments to aes puerto rico, there could be a material impact on the company.
united states of america - the outcome of the 2016 u.s. elections could result in significant changes to u.s. tax laws, and environmental and energy policies, the impact of which is uncertain.
philippines - the outcome of the 2016 philippines election could result in changes in policies towards the u.s., china or other nations the impact of which on our business is uncertain.
foreign exchange and commodities our businesses are exposed to and proactively manage market risk. our primary market risk exposure is to the price of commodities, particularly electricity, oil, natural gas, coal and environmental credits. in 2016, there were more than 50% improvement in both oil and natural gas prices, which had a positive impact on our businesses in the dominican republic, ohio and northern ireland. since we operate in multiple countries, we are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between our functional currency, the u.s.
103
dollar, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. in 2016, we had a significant devaluation in the argentine peso. the brazilian real, colombian peso and kazakhstani tenge recovered during the year, but remain devalued as compared to the beginning of 2015, which had an offsetting impact on our 2016 results. for additional information, refer to item 7a.-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
alto maipo during 2016, the alto maipo project in chile experienced technical difficulties in construction which resulted in an increase in projected costs of up to 22% over the original $2 billion budget. these additional costs have led to a series of negotiations with the main contractors, financiers and partners of the project, with the intention to restructure the existing financing and obtain additional financing to guarantee project completion. on january 19, 2017, the parties agreed on the basis of the restructuring process, including new project milestones. these agreements are subject to the negotiation and finalization of the specific restructuring terms and conditions; and the negotiation and approval of the terms and conditions of each of the financing documents. currently, the company's indirect equity interest in the project is 40%.
impairments long-lived assets - during the year ended december 31, 2016, the company recognized asset impairment expense of $1.1 billion. due to decreased wind production and a decline in forward power curves in 2016, the company tested the recoverability of its long-lived assets at buffalo gap i, ii, and iii. after recognizing asset impairment expense of $236 million at buffalo gap i and ii, the carrying value of the long-lived asset groups at buffalo gap i, ii, and iii totaled $242 million at december 31, 2016.
additionally, the company recognized an asset impairment expense of $859 million at dpl in 2016. after recognizing asset impairment expense at dpl, the carrying value of the long-lived asset groups at dpl, including those that were not impaired, totaled $498 million at december 31, 2016. see note 20-asset impairment expense in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding the impairments at buffalo gap and dpl.
events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate further recoverability tests and potential impairments of long-lived assets may include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation that it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
goodwill - the company currently has no reporting units considered to be "at risk." a reporting unit is considered "at risk" when its fair value is not higher than its carrying amount by more than 10%. the company monitors its reporting units at risk of step 1 failure on an ongoing basis. it is possible that the company may incur goodwill impairment charges at any reporting units containing goodwill in future periods if adverse changes in their business or operating environments occur. see note 9-goodwill and other intangible assets in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
capital resources and liquidity overview - as of december 31, 2016, the company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion, of which $100 million was held at the parent company and qualified holding companies. the company also had $798 million in short term investments, held primarily at subsidiaries. in addition, we had restricted cash and debt service reserves of $871 million. the company also had non-recourse and recourse aggregate principal amounts of debt outstanding of $15.8 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. of the approximately $1.3 billion of our current non-recourse debt, $1.2 billion was presented as such because it is due in the next twelve months and $128 million relates to debt considered in default due to covenant violations. the defaults are not payment defaults, but are instead technical defaults triggered by failure to comply with other covenants and/or other conditions such as (but not limited to) failure to meet information covenants, complete construction or other milestones in an allocated time, meet certain minimum or maximum financial ratios, or other requirements contained in the non-recourse debt documents of the company.
104
we expect such current maturities will be repaid from net cash provided by operating activities of the subsidiary to which the debt relates or through opportunistic refinancing activity or some combination thereof. none of our recourse debt matures within the next twelve months. from time to time, we may elect to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise when management believes that such securities are attractively priced. such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements and other factors. the amounts involved in any such repurchases may be material.
we rely mainly on long-term debt obligations to fund our construction activities. we have, to the extent available at acceptable terms, utilized non-recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric power plants, distribution companies and related assets. our non-recourse financing is designed to limit cross default risk to the parent company or other subsidiaries and affiliates. our non-recourse long-term debt is a combination of fixed and variable interest rate instruments. generally, a portion or all of the variable rate debt is fixed through the use of interest rate swaps. in addition, the debt is typically denominated in the currency that matches the currency of the revenue expected to be generated from the benefiting project, thereby reducing currency risk. in certain cases, the currency is matched through the use of derivative instruments. the majority of our non-recourse debt is funded by international commercial banks, with debt capacity supplemented by multilaterals and local regional banks.
given our long-term debt obligations, the company is subject to interest rate risk on debt balances that accrue interest at variable rates. when possible, the company will borrow funds at fixed interest rates or hedge its variable rate debt to fix its interest costs on such obligations. in addition, the company has historically tried to maintain at least 70% of its consolidated long-term obligations at fixed interest rates, including fixing the interest rate through the use of interest rate swaps. these efforts apply to the notional amount of the swaps compared to the amount of related underlying debt. presently, the parent company's only material un-hedged exposure to variable interest rate debt relates to indebtedness under its floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2019. on a consolidated basis, of the company's $20.5 billion of total debt outstanding as of december 31, 2016, approximately $3.5 billion bore interest at variable rates that were not subject to a derivative instrument which fixed the interest rate. brazil holds $1.3 billion of our floating rate non-recourse exposure as we have no ability to fix local debt interest rates efficiently.
in addition to utilizing non-recourse debt at a subsidiary level when available, the parent company provides a portion, or in certain instances all, of the remaining long-term financing or credit required to fund development, construction or acquisition of a particular project. these investments have generally taken the form of equity investments or intercompany loans, which are subordinated to the project's non-recourse loans. we generally obtain the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sales of assets and/or the proceeds from our issuances of debt, common stock and other securities. similarly, in certain of our businesses, the parent company may provide financial guarantees or other credit support for the benefit of counterparties who have entered into contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity, equipment or other services with our subsidiaries or lenders. in such circumstances, if a business defaults on its payment or supply obligation, the parent company will be responsible for the business' obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit support. at december 31, 2016, the parent company had provided outstanding financial and performance-related guarantees or other credit support commitments to or for the benefit of our businesses, which were limited by the terms of the agreements, of approximately $535 million in aggregate (excluding those collateralized by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below).
as a result of the parent company's below investment grade rating, counterparties may be unwilling to accept our general unsecured commitments to provide credit support. accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, the parent company may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit, to backstop or replace our credit support. the parent company may not be able to provide adequate assurances to such counterparties. to the extent we are required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, this will reduce the amount of credit available to us to meet our other liquidity needs. at december 31, 2016, we had $6 million in letters of credit outstanding, provided under our senior secured credit facility, $245 million in letters of credit outstanding, provided under our un-senior secured credit facility and $3 million in cash collateralized letters of credit outstanding outside of our senior secured credit facility. these letters of credit operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development activities and business operations. during the year ended december 31, 2016, the company paid letter of credit fees ranging from 0.2% to 2.5% per annum on the outstanding amounts.
we expect to continue to seek, where possible, non-recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that we or our affiliates may develop, construct or acquire. however, depending on local and global market conditions and the unique characteristics of individual businesses, non-recourse debt may not be available
105
on economically attractive terms or at all. if we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a subsidiary project that is under construction or has near-term debt payment obligations and that subsidiary is unable to obtain additional non-recourse debt, such subsidiary may become insolvent, and we may lose our investment in that subsidiary. additionally, if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer, the subsidiary may need to withdraw from a project or restructure the non-recourse debt financing. if we or the subsidiary choose not to proceed with a project or are unable to successfully complete a restructuring of the non-recourse debt, we may lose our investment in that subsidiary.
many of our subsidiaries depend on timely and continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity needs. the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, to refinance existing indebtedness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economic uncertainty may have material adverse effects on the financial condition and results of operations of those subsidiaries. in addition, changes in the timing of tariff increases or delays in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions could affect the cash flows and results of operations of our businesses.
long-term receivables - as of december 31, 2016, the company had approximately $264 million of accounts receivable classified as noncurrent assets-other related to certain of its generation businesses in argentina and the u.s. and its utility business in brazil. the noncurrent portion primarily consists of accounts receivable in argentina that, pursuant to amended agreements or government resolutions, have collection periods that extend beyond december 31, 2017, or one year from the latest balance sheet date. the majority of argentinian receivables have been converted into long-term financing for the construction of power plants. see note 6-financing receivables included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data and item 1.-business-regulatory matters-argentina of this form 10-k for further information.

parent company liquidity the following discussion of parent company liquidity has been included because we believe it is a useful measure of the liquidity available to the aes corporation, or the parent company, given the non-recourse nature of most of our indebtedness. parent company liquidity as outlined below is a non-gaap measure and should not be construed as an alternative to cash and cash equivalents which are determined in accordance with gaap, as a measure of liquidity. cash and cash equivalents are disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows. parent company liquidity may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. the principal sources of liquidity at the parent company level are dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, including refinancing proceeds; proceeds from debt and equity financings at the parent company level, including availability under our credit facility; and proceeds from asset sales. cash requirements at the parent company level are primarily to fund interest; principal repayments of debt; construction commitments; other equity commitments; common stock repurchases; acquisitions; taxes; parent company overhead and development costs; and dividends on common stock.
the company defines parent company liquidity as cash available to the parent company plus available borrowings under existing credit facility. the cash held at qualified holding companies represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the u.s.. such subsidiaries have no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to the parent company. parent company liquidity is reconciled to its most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measure, cash and cash equivalents, at december 31, 2016 and 2015 as follows:

the company paid dividends of $0.44 per share to its common stockholders during the year ended december 31, 2016. while we intend to continue payment of dividends and believe we will have sufficient liquidity to do so, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends, or if continued, the amount of such dividends.
recourse debt - our recourse debt at year-end was approximately $4.7 billion and $5.0 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. see note 11-debt in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for additional detail.
while we believe that our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital markets (see key trends and uncertainties-global economic conditions), the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, currency exchange rates, power market pool prices, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. in addition, our subsidiaries' ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us (at the parent company level) is subject to certain limitations contained in loans, governmental provisions and other agreements. we can provide no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that the actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated. see item 1a.-risk factors-the aes corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its public debt securities, is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise, of this form 10-k.
various debt instruments at the parent company level, including our senior secured credit facility, contain certain restrictive covenants. the covenants provide for - among other items - limitations on other indebtedness, liens, investments and guarantees; limitations on dividends, stock repurchases and other equity transactions; restrictions and limitations on mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, leases, transactions with affiliates and off-balance sheet and derivative arrangements; maintenance of certain financial ratios; and financial and other reporting requirements.
as of december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with these covenants at the parent company level.
non-recourse debt - while the lenders under our non-recourse debt financings generally do not have direct recourse to the parent company, defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for our results of operations and liquidity, including, without limitation:
•   reducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the parent company during the time period of any default;
•   triggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support we have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;
•   causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; and
•   triggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the parent company.
for example, our senior secured credit facility and outstanding debt securities at the parent company include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. in addition, our revolving credit agreement at the parent company includes events of default related to payment defaults and accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries.
some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. the total non-recourse debt classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets amounts to $1.3 billion. the portion of current debt related to such defaults was $128 million at december 31, 2016, all of which was non-recourse debt related to two subsidiaries - kavarna, and sogrinsk. see note 11-debt in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for additional detail.
none of the subsidiaries that are currently in default are subsidiaries that met the applicable definition of materiality under aes' corporate debt agreements as of december 31, 2016 in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under aes' indebtedness. however, as a result of additional dispositions of
116
assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results of operations or the financial position of the individual subsidiary, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a "material subsidiary" and thereby upon an acceleration trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the parent company's outstanding debt securities. a material subsidiary is defined in the company's senior secured revolving credit facility as any business that contributed 20% or more of the parent company's total cash distributions from businesses for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters. as of december 31, 2016, none of the defaults listed above individually or in the aggregate results in or is at risk of triggering a cross-default under the recourse debt of the company.

(1)   excludes normal and customary representations and warranties in agreements for the sale of assets (including ownership in associated legal entities) where the associated risk is considered to be nominal.
as of december 31, 2016, the company had no commitments to invest in subsidiaries under construction and to purchase related equipment that were not included in the letters of credit disclosed above.
we have a diverse portfolio of performance-related contingent contractual obligations. these obligations are designed to cover potential risks and only require payment if certain targets are not met or certain contingencies occur. the risks associated with these obligations include change of control, construction cost overruns, subsidiary default, political risk, tax indemnities, spot market power prices, sponsor support and liquidated damages under power sales agreements for projects in development, in operation and under construction. in addition, we have an asset sale program through which we may have customary indemnity obligations under certain assets sale agreements. while we do not expect that we will be required to fund any material amounts under these contingent contractual obligations beyond 2016, many of the events which would give rise to such obligations are beyond our control. we can provide no assurance that we will be able to fund our obligations under these contingent contractual obligations if we are required to make substantial payments thereunder.

critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements of aes are prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. aes' significant accounting policies are described in note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
an accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.
management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee, as appropriate. listed below are the company's most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes - we are subject to income taxes in both the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities. the company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. the company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each tax jurisdiction when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. tax reserves have been established, which the company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. while the company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may be materially different than the reserve amounts.
because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix could materially impact our effective tax rate. furthermore, our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof and such changes may be more likely or become more likely in view of recent economic trends in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate. as an example, new tax laws were enacted in february 2016 in chile which increased the statutory income tax rate for most of our chilean businesses from 25% to 25.5% in 2017 and to 27% for 2018 and future years. accordingly, in 2016 our net chilean deferred tax liabilities were remeasured to the new rates. the remeasurement amount and other potential future impacts of the changes in tax law may be material to continuing operations. see note 21-income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information.
the company's provision for income taxes could be adversely impacted by changes to the u.s. taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. since 2006, the company has benefited from the controlled foreign corporation look-through rule, originally enacted in the tipra of 2005, subject to five temporary extensions, including the most recent five year retroactive extension enacted on december 18, 2015 in the h.r.2029 - consolidated appropriations act, 2016. there can be no assurance that this provision will continue to be extended beyond december 31, 2019. further, the u.s. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly change corporate tax rates, business rules such as interest deductibility and capital expenditure cost recovery, and u.s. international tax rules. our expected effective tax rate could increase by amounts that may be material to the company should such reforms be enacted.
in addition, u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax bases. the company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
sales of noncontrolling interests - the accounting for a sale of noncontrolling interests under the accounting standards depends on whether the sale is considered to be a sale of in-substance real estate (as
118
opposed to an equity transaction), where the gain (loss) on sale would be recognized in earnings rather than within stockholders' equity. if management's estimation process determines that there is no significant value beyond the in-substance real estate, the gain (loss) on the sale of the noncontrolling interest is recognized in earnings. however, if it is determined that significant value likely exists beyond the in-substance real estate, the gain (loss) on the sale of the noncontrolling interest would be recognized within stockholders' equity. in-substance real estate is comprised of land plus improvements and integral equipment. the determination of whether property, plant and equipment is integral equipment is based on the significance of the costs to remove the equipment from its existing location (including the cost of repairing damage resulting from the removal), combined with the decrease in the fair value of the equipment as a result of those removal activities. when the combined total of removal costs and the decrease in fair value of the equipment exceeds 10% of the fair value of the equipment, the equipment is considered integral equipment. the accounting standards specifically identify power plants as an example of in-substance real estate. where the consolidated entity in which noncontrolling interests have been sold contains in-substance real estate, management estimates the extent to which the total fair value of the assets of the entity is represented by the in-substance real estate and whether significant value exists beyond the in-substance real estate. this estimation considers all qualitative and quantitative factors relevant for each sale and, where appropriate, includes making quantitative estimates about the fair value of the entity and its identifiable assets and liabilities (including any favorable or unfavorable contracts) by analogy to the accounting standards on business combinations. as such, these estimates may require significant judgment and assumptions, similar to the critical accounting estimates discussed below for impairments and fair value.
impairments - our accounting policies on goodwill and long-lived assets are described in detail in note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies, included in item 8 of this form 10-k. the company makes considerable judgments in its impairment evaluations of goodwill and long-lived assets; however, the fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part in an impairment evaluation.
the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit or a long-lived asset (asset group) by applying the approaches prescribed under the fair value measurement accounting framework. generally, the market approach and income approach are most relevant in the fair value measurement of our reporting units and long-lived assets; however, due to the lack of available relevant observable market information in many circumstances, the company often relies on the income approach. the company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. the decision to engage an independent valuation firm considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including a cost-benefit analysis and the company's internal valuation knowledge of the long-lived asset (asset group) or business. the company develops the underlying assumptions consistent with its internal budgets and forecasts for such valuations. additionally, the company uses an internal discounted cash flow valuation model (the "dcf model"), based on the principles of present value techniques, to estimate the fair value of its reporting units or long-lived assets under the income approach. the dcf model estimates fair value by discounting our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate.
management applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts. examples of the input assumptions that our budgets and forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices and commodity prices. whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources (e.g., economic intelligence unit) and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. the input assumptions most significant to our budgets and cash flows are based on expectations of macroeconomic factors which have been volatile recently. it is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factor expectations and related assumptions. as a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts.
a considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the dcf model. to the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., bloomberg, capital iq, etc.). the company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the most likely market participants. it is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate.
119
fair value of a reporting unit or a long-lived asset (asset group) is sensitive to both input assumptions to our budgets and cash flow forecasts and the discount rate. further, estimates of long-term growth and terminal value are often critical to the fair value determination. as part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. the level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.
further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the company can be found within note 9-goodwill and other intangible assets, note 20-asset impairment expense and note 8-other non-operating expense to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
fair value fair value hierarchy - the company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. the valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments' complexity.
to increase consistency and enhance disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, the fair value measurement standard includes a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three categories. an asset or liability's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement, where level 1 is the highest and level 3 is the lowest. for more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
fair value of financial instruments - a significant number of the company's financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. the company makes estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the consolidated financial statements. these assets and liabilities include short and long-term investments in debt and equity securities, included in the balance sheet line items short-term investments and other assets (noncurrent), derivative assets, included in other current assets and other assets (noncurrent) and derivative liabilities, included in accrued and other liabilities (current) and other long-term liabilities. investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. the company's investments are primarily certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. the company's derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. additional discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in note 4-fair value included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
fair value of nonfinancial assets and liabilities - significant estimates are made in determining the fair value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill) during the impairment evaluation process. in addition, the majority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are required to be recognized at fair value under the relevant accounting guidance. in determining the fair value of these items, management makes several assumptions as discussed in the impairments section above.
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities - we enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. we primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity and foreign currency exposures. we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.
in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value except where derivatives qualify and are designated as "normal purchase/normal sale" transactions. changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. income and expense related to derivative instruments are recognized in the same category as that generated by the underlying asset or liability. see note 5-derivative instruments and hedging activities included in item 8 of this form 10-k for further information on the classification.
120
the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposure being hedged. these hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the exposure being hedged. the company has no fair value hedges at this time. changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated as and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions occur. any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. for all hedge contracts, the company provides formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging.
the fair value measurement accounting standard provides additional guidance on the definition of fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. the fair value measurement standard requires the company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. these factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). due to the nature of the company's interest rate swaps, which are typically associated with non-recourse debt, credit risk for aes is evaluated at the subsidiary level rather than at the parent company level. nonperformance risk on the company's derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize observable market inputs.
as a result of uncertainty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. as a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our counterparty's), and future exchange rates. refer to note 4-fair value included in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional details.
the fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal and third party valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. the company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., bloomberg, reuters and platt's). in some cases, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instrument's fair value. in certain instances, the published curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. specifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exchange contracts, beyond the traded points the company utilizes the purchasing power parity approach to construct the remaining portion of the forward curve using relative inflation rates. additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on "indicative pricing" quotes from financial institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. these indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid or ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. for individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value.
regulatory assets - management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, any asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating income.
consolidation - the company has recently entered into several transactions whereby the company sells an interest in its controlled subsidiaries and/or equity method investments. in connection with each transaction, the company must determine whether the sale of the interest impacts the company's consolidation conclusion by first determining whether the transaction should be evaluated under the variable interest model or the voting model. in determining which consolidation model applies to the transaction, the company is required to make judgments about how the entity operates, the most significant of which are whether (i) the entity has sufficient equity to finance its activities, (ii) the equity holders, as a group, have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and (iii) whether the entity has non-substantive voting rights.
if the entity is determined to be a variable interest entity, the most significant judgment in determining whether the company must consolidate the entity is whether the company, including its related parties and de facto agents, collectively have power and benefits. if aes is determined to have power and benefits, the entity will be consolidated by aes.

alternatively, if the entity is determined to be a voting model entity, the most significant judgments involve determining whether the non-aes shareholders have substantive participating rights. the assessment of shareholder rights and whether they are substantive participating rights requires significant judgment since the rights provided under shareholders' agreements may include selecting, terminating, and setting the compensation of management responsible for implementing the subsidiary's policies and procedures, establishing operating and capital decisions of the entity, including budgets, in the ordinary course of business. on the other hand, if shareholder rights are only protective in nature (referred to as protective rights) then such rights would not overcome the presumption that the owner of a majority voting interest shall consolidate its investee. significant judgment is required to determine whether minority rights represent substantive participating rights or protective rights that do not affect the evaluation of control. while both represent an approval or veto right, a distinguishing factor is the underlying activity or action to which the right relates.

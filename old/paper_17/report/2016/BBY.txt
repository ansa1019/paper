item 1a. risk factors.
described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. you should carefully consider each of the following risk factors in conjunction with other information provided in this annual report on form 10-k and in our other public disclosures. the risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing and, consequently, the market value of our common stock and debt instruments. these risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. the risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. there may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. all forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below.
we face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers and vendors and mobile network carriers that offer their products and services directly to customers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability.
the retail business is highly competitive. price is of great importance to most customers, and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. the ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. we compete with many other local, regional, national and international retailers and technology service providers, as well as certain of our vendors and mobile network carriers that offer products directly to consumers. some of our competitors have greater financial resources than us and may be able to offer lower prices than us for a sustained period of time. the retail industry continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications, and some online-only businesses have lower operating costs than us and are not required to collect and remit sales taxes in all u.s. states, which can negatively impact the ability of multi-channel retailers to be price competitive on a tax-included basis. online and multi-channel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, with customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, puts pressure on our margins.
as these and related competitive factors evolve, we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability.
many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement, product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences.
7
in general, consumer electronics product life cycles (which begin with initial market launch and conclude with maturity or obsolescence) have become shorter and less predictable. this is largely due to rapid technological advancement and innovation and generally faster adoption by consumers. consumer preferences have also become susceptible to rapid change, and this adds to the unpredictability of our business. these factors affect us in a number of ways, for example:
•   the emergence of new products and categories (for example, virtual reality);
•   the rapid maturity and decline of relatively new categories (for example, tablets);
•   cannibalization of categories (for example, the effect of smart phones on demand for gps, mobile audio, digital imaging devices, etc.);
•   intense consumer interest in high-profile product updates (for example, smartphone model updates) which concentrates purchasing activity around new launch dates and can often lead to shortages of merchandise;
•   unpredictable consumer adoption rates (for example, contrasting adoption rates of 3d and ultra-hd televisions);
•   rapidly declining price-points in many categories (for example, digital imaging, ultra-hd televisions, etc.); and
•   availability of content (for example, ultra-hd programming, online streaming services, sporting events or other broadcast programming).
the effects of these factors can also be exacerbated by the competitive environment and the ease with which customers can research and compare product features and price. if we fail to interpret, predict and react to these factors in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include:
•   not offering the products and services that our customers want;
•   having excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation;
•   not securing adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply;
•   delays in adapting our merchandising, marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and
•   damage to our brand and reputation.
these and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.
our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability.
we source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. in fiscal 2017, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 77% of the merchandise we purchased (75% in fiscal 2016), with 5 suppliers - apple, samsung, sony, hewlett-packard, and lg electronics - representing approximately 53% of total merchandise purchased (51% in fiscal 2016). we generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. our profitability depends on us securing acceptable terms with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties. to varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages -- for example, their financial strength, the strength of their brand with customers, their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers -- to our commercial disadvantage. the potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. generally, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues, consequently impacting our profitability from such vendor relationships.
we are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. the competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business. for example, if carriers change the structure of customer contracts, customer upgrade terms, customer qualification requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenues and profitability. in addition, our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels. carriers may decide to cease allowing us to offer their contracts or certain categories of their contracts, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our commissions or other terms. each of these factors could have a materially adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.
we have internal standards that we require all of our vendors to meet. our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our standards of quality and safety can be difficult, especially with respect
8
to goods sourced from outside the u.s. political or financial instability, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, cross-border trade restrictions or tariffs, work stoppages, port delays, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. these and other related issues could materially adversely affect our financial results.
product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.
if the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety and quality, we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged. failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches in laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation. recalls of products, particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or our difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products, could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.
our focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation.
we offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings, including consultation, design, delivery, installation, set-up, protection plans, repair, technical support and educational classes. designing, marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks. these risks include, for example:
•   increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises, which may be higher than the related revenue;
•   unpredictable warranty failure rates and related expenses;
•   employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes, which may increase our scope of liability;
•   the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings;
•   employees having access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the data they hold; and
•   the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation and the potential responsibility for the actions they take and for compliance with building codes and related regulations.
in addition, as customers increasingly migrate to websites and mobile applications to initiate transactions, it is inherently more difficult to demonstrate and explain the features and benefits of our service offerings, which can lead to a lower revenue mix of these services. if, for these or other reasons, we fail to design and market services effectively to our customers or fail to meet our customers' expectations in the execution of these services, our reputation, revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.
macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results.
to varying degrees, our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. as a result, consumers may be affected in many different ways, including, for example:
•   whether or not they make a purchase;
•   their choice of brand, model or price-point;
•   how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices; and
•   their appetite for complementary services (for example, protection plans).
consumer confidence, inflation, employment levels, oil prices, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumers' demand for the products and services that we offer. our future results could be significantly adversely impacted by these factors.
interruptions and other factors affecting our supply chain, including in-bound deliveries from our vendors, may adversely affect our business.
our supply chain is a critical part of our operations, particularly in light of recent industry trends and initiatives such as ship-from-store and the emphasis on fast and free delivery when purchasing online. we depend on our vendors' ability to deliver
9
products to us at the right location, right time and in the right quantities. we also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network. the factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include:
•   interruptions to our delivery capabilities;
•   failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments;
•   disruptions to our systems and implementation of new systems;
•   limitations in capacity;
•   consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors;
•   labor strikes or slow-downs impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain;
•   damages or other loss to products; and
•   costs that are excessive.
the risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries, because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business. the continuing growth of e-commerce increases our exposure to these risks. if we fail to manage these risks effectively, we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue and profitability.
if we fail to attract, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operations and profitability may be harmed. changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability.
our performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores, service centers, distribution centers, field and corporate offices. our strategy of offering high quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. the turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers, availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages. we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. in addition, a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations.
demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition.
we operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. we believe that recognition and the reputation of our brands are key to our success. the ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in, among other things, declines in customer loyalty, decreases in gift card and service plan sales, lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues, all of which could materially affect our revenue and profitability.
our success is dependent on the design and execution of appropriate business strategies.
we operate in a highly-competitive and ever-changing commercial environment. our success is dependent on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate strategies within this environment. strategies that have proved successful in the past may not be successful in the future. our current strategy includes continuous improvement of our business and the pursuit of new growth opportunities. it is possible that our strategies may be ineffective and that we may need to make substantial changes to them in the future. it is also possible that we will be unsuccessful in executing our strategies or that they expose us to additional risks. our results could be materially adversely affected if we fail to develop and execute appropriate strategies. the market value of our common stock and debt instruments could be materially adversely affected if investors are uncertain about the appropriateness of our strategies or our ability to execute them.
refer to item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for further information regarding our strategies.
failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results.
10
effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our multi-channel strategy. most of our properties are subject to long-term leases. as such, it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our long-term real estate strategy. such factors include, for example:
•   changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving omni-channel environment;
•   the appropriate number of stores in our portfolio;
•   the formats and sizes of our stores;
•   the locations of our stores;
•   the interior layouts of our stores;
•   the trade area demographics and economic data of each of our stores;
•   the local competitive positioning in and around our stores;
•   the primary term lease commitment for each store;
•   the long-term lease option coverage for each store;
•   the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents;
•   our supply chain network strategy; and
•   our ongoing network of service locations.
if we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example:
•   having to close stores and abandon the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the leases;
•   incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores;
•   having stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and
•   bearing excessive lease expenses.
these consequences could have a materially adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.
for leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. it is difficult for us to influence some of these factors, and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. in addition to rent, we are still responsible for the maintenance, taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. similarly, when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessor. this leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sub-lease tenant.
failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
some of our operating costs are fixed and/or are subject to multi-year contracts. some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors, because of, for example, our differential service offerings or levels of customer service. as discussed above, our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources, which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues. accordingly, our ongoing drive to reduce cost and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative. failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives.
our liquidity may be materially adversely affected by constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms.
we need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations, or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. the principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables. our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. if our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. the future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions, the availability of credit and our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders. these factors could materially adversely affect our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue business opportunities, and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.
changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs.
11
our credit ratings and outlooks at march 20, 2017, are summarized below. in fiscal 2017, standard & poor's rating services upgraded its long-term credit rating from bb+ to bbb- with a stable outlook; moody's investors service, inc. affirmed its long-term credit rating of baa1 with a stable outlook; and fitch ratings limited affirmed its long-term credit rating of bbb- with a stable outlook.
rating agency           rating   outlook standard &amp; poor's   bbb-     stable moody's                 baa1     stable fitch                   bbb-     stable any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets, borrowing costs, vendor terms and lease terms. our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies.
we are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.
approximately one-third of our revenue and more than one-half of our net earnings have historically been generated in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the u.s., canada and mexico. in addition, the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors, such as the level of competitive promotional activity and customer buying patterns, which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly. unexpected events or developments such as natural or man-made disasters, economic factors, product sourcing issues, failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third-party vendors could significantly disrupt our operations. as a result of these factors, there is a risk that our fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected.
failure to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business.
we may decide to enter into new joint ventures, partnerships, alliances or acquisitions with third parties (collectively, "new ventures"). assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors, including, for example:
•   different and incremental business risks of the new venture;
•   failure to motivate and retain key employees of the new venture;
•   uncertainty of forecasting financial performance;
•   failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business, such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems;
•   failure to maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting;
•   failure to generate expected synergies such as cost reductions;
•   unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture;
•   disputes or strategic differences with other third party participants in the new venture; and
•   adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture.
if new ventures are unsuccessful, our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired. new ventures may also divert our financial resources and management's attention from other important areas of our business.
failure to protect or effectively respond to breach of the integrity, security and confidentiality of our employee and customer data could expose us to litigation costs and materially damage our standing with our employees or customers.
the use and handling of personally identifiable data by our business, our business associates and third parties is regulated at the state, federal and international levels. we are also contractually obligated to comply with certain industry standards regarding payment card information. increasing costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff, the costs of compliance and costs resulting from fraud could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. additionally, the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of customer and other
12
confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. while we take significant steps to protect this information, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties or failure to effectively respond to such compromises, may undermine our security measures. as a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee, customer and other confidential data. advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may not prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and customer personal data. furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures. any such compromise of our security or the security of information residing with our business associates or third parties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationship with our employees, which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue, and may expose us to material costs, penalties and compensation claims. in addition, any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk.
catastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results.
the risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. such events may be caused by, for example:
•   natural disasters or extreme weather events;
•   diseases or epidemics that may affect our employees, customers or partners;
•   floods, fire or other catastrophes affecting our properties; or
•   terrorism, civil unrest or other conflicts.
such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network. as a consequence of these or other catastrophic events, we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability.
our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results.
sales of our exclusive brands products, which include insignia, modal, dynex, init, platinum and rocketfish branded products, represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability. most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeastern asia. this arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could materially adversely affect our operating results:
•   we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brand product defects, and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions;
•   we may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive brand products, some of which may require us to take significant actions such as product recalls;
•   we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key manufacturers or unforeseen natural disasters;
•   we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brand products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;
•   we are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;
•   we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brand products;
•   we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brand products or manufacturing processes; and
•   regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of "conflict minerals" in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and, depending on the findings of our country of origin inquiry, could have an adverse effect on our reputation.
maintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty, generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins. failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the profits we are able to generate from them.
13
we are subject to certain statutory, regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
our statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially adversely affect our operations. some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are:
•   the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;
•   the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials;
•   ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulation related to product safety and product transport;
•   the impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security, whether imposed as a result of increased cyber-security risks or otherwise;
•   the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations including, but not limited to, financial reform, national labor relations board rule changes, health care reform, corporate governance matters, escheatment rules and/or other as yet unknown legislation, that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;
•   the impact of the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the u.s. or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products;
•   the impact of potential changes in u.s. or other countries tax laws and regulations, including the imposition of the border adjustment tax on imported products as is currently being discussed by u.s. congress that could increase the cost of the products we sell because a significant portion of the products we sell in the u.s. are sourced from outside of the country; and
•   the impact of litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters.
regulatory activity focused on the retail industry has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance. additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management's attention and resources from other matters.
changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model.
as an employer of approximately 125,000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including, for example:
•   unionization and related regulations that affect the nature of labor relations, the organization of unions and union elections; in the u.s. the national labor relations board continually considers changes to such regulations; as of january 28, 2017, none of our u.s. operations had employees represented by labor unions or working under collective bargaining agreements;
•   laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors; and
•   laws that impact minimum wage, sick time, paid leave and scheduling requirements, that could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide.
changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to continue operations and our profitability.
economic, regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs.
we offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low- or no-interest financing on qualifying purchases. we believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases. approximately 23% of our fiscal 2017 revenue was transacted using one of the company's branded cards. in addition, we earn profit-share income from our banking partners based on the performance of the programs. the income we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors, including the volume and value of transactions, the terms of promotional financing offers, bad debt
14
rates, interest rates, the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program. adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs.
we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business.
the effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. we rely heavily on our management information systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, point-of-sale processing, services fulfillment, staff planning and deployment, website offerings, financial management, reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information. the failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate (whether from internal or external factors), or to meet the continuously evolving needs of our business, could significantly disrupt our business and cause, for example, higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation.
we utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications. disruptions to these services, such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels, malicious attacks or other technical difficulties, could cause us to forgo material revenues, incur material costs and adversely affect our reputation with consumers.
we utilize third-party vendors for certain aspects of our business operations.
we engage key third-party business partners to support various functions of our business, including but not limited to, information technology, web hosting and cloud-based services, human resource operations, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, gift cards, customer warranty, technical support, transportation and insurance programs. any material disruption in our relationship with key third-party business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations, particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods.
our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above, as well as to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate.
we operate retail locations in canada and mexico. in addition, we have wholly owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries, including bermuda, china, germany, hong kong, luxembourg, the republic of mauritius, turks and caicos, and the u.k. during fiscal 2017, our international segment's operations generated 8% of our revenue. in general, the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our international operations. in addition, our international operations also expose us to other risks, including those related to, for example:
•   political conditions;
•   economic conditions, including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules;
•   legal and regulatory environments;
•   rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign entities;
•   risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates;
•   cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately;
•   difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; and
•   difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations.
these factors could significantly disrupt our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead to us incurring material impairments and other exit costs.
failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price.
we may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forward-looking information for future periods. although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management's expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential stockholders, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided. if our financial results for a particular period
15
do not meet our guidance or the expectations of market participants or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. unless otherwise noted, transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude. our md&a is presented in the following sections:
•   overview
•   business strategy
•   best buy 2020: building the new blue
•   results of operations
•   liquidity and capital resources
•   critical accounting estimates
•   new accounting pronouncements our md&a should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k.
overview we are a leading provider of technology products, services and solutions. we offer these products and services to customers who visit our stores, engage with geek squad agents or use our websites or mobile applications. we have operations in the u.s., canada and mexico. we operate two reportable segments: domestic and international. the domestic segment is comprised of all operations within the u.s. and its districts and territories. the international segment is comprised of all operations outside the u.s. and its territories.
our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest the end of january. fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 each included 52 weeks, noting that fiscal 2018 will include 53 weeks with the additional week included in the fourth quarter. our business, like that of many
25
retailers, is seasonal. a higher proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the u.s., canada and mexico ("holiday").
throughout this md&a, we refer to comparable sales. our comparable sales calculation compares revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months, as well as revenue related to certain other comparable sales channels for a particular period to the corresponding period in the prior year. relocated stores, as well as remodeled, expanded and downsized stores closed more than 14 days, are excluded from the comparable sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. acquisitions are included in the comparable sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. the calculation of comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (applicable to our international segment only). the canadian brand consolidation, which included the permanent closure of 66 future shop stores, the conversion of 65 future shop stores to best buy stores and the elimination of the future shop website, had a material impact on a year-over-year basis on the remaining canadian retail stores and the website. as such, from the first quarter of fiscal 2016 through the third quarter of fiscal 2017, all canadian store and website revenue was removed from the comparable sales base and the international segment no longer had a comparable metric. therefore, consolidated comparable sales equaled the domestic segment comparable sales. beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we resumed reporting international comparable sales as revenue in the international segment was once again deemed to be comparable and, as such, consolidated comparable sales are once again equal to the aggregation of domestic and international comparable sales. however, we have not provided international comparable sales for fiscal 2017 as the calculation would only include comparable revenue from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and may be misleading in future periods when used for comparison purposes. the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. as a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers' methods.
non-gaap financial measures this md&a includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap"), as well as certain adjusted or non-gaap financial measures such as constant currency, non-gaap operating income, non-gaap effective tax rate, non-gaap net earnings from continuing operations, non-gaap diluted earnings per share ("eps") from continuing operations and non-gaap debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent ("ebitdar") ratio. we believe that non-gaap financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with gaap financial measures, can provide more information to assist investors in evaluating current period performance and in assessing future performance. for these reasons, our internal management reporting also includes non-gaap measures. generally, our non-gaap measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges, goodwill impairments, non-restructuring asset impairments and gains or losses on investments. in addition, certain other items may be excluded from non-gaap financial measures when we believe this provides greater clarity to management and our investors. these non-gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, gaap financial measures. we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. non-gaap measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
in our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our international segment, we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the international segment's operating results from local currencies into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes. we also use the term "constant currency", which represents results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts. we calculate those impacts as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates. we believe the disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates and our inability to report comparable store sales for the international segment in fiscal 2016 as a result of the canadian brand consolidation.
refer to the non-gaap financial measures section below for the detailed reconciliation of items that impacted the non-gaap operating income, non-gaap effective tax rate, non-gaap net earnings from continuing operations and non-gaap diluted eps from continuing operations in the presented periods.
refer to the other financial measures section below for the detailed reconciliation of items that impacted the non-gaap debt to ebitdar ratio. management believes this ratio is an important indicator of our creditworthiness. furthermore, we believe that our non-gaap debt to ebitdar ratio is important for understanding our financial position and provides meaningful additional information about our ability to service our long-term debt and other fixed obligations and to fund our future growth. we also believe our non-gaap debt to ebitdar ratio is relevant because it enables investors to compare our indebtedness to
26
that of retailers who own, rather than lease, their stores. our decision to own or lease real estate is based on an assessment of our financial liquidity, our capital structure, our desire to own or to lease the location, the owner's desire to own or to lease the location and the alternative that results in the highest return to our shareholders.
business strategy during fiscal 2017, we executed against the three priorities we shared at the beginning of the year:
1.   build on our strong industry position and multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business;
2.   drive cost reduction and efficiencies; and
3.   advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation.
below is summary of our progress against these priorities:
•   we believe we continued to gain market share in most of our product categories. we believe the total market for our product categories was down low-single digits in calendar 2016 and that our market share gains helped us offset the market decline;
•   we increased our net promoter score by over 350 basis points;
•   we grew the domestic segment online revenue with comparable sales of 20.8% in fiscal 2017;
•   the successful canadian brand consolidation was the primary driver of operating income of $90 million in our international segment for fiscal 2017 compared to a loss of $210 million in fiscal 2016;
•   we continued to progress against our three-year target to reduce cost and optimize gross profit by $400 million and achieved $350 million cumulative savings by the end of fiscal 2017; these savings enable us to invest in customer experience improvements while maintaining near flat sg&amp;a;
•   as for the third priority, fiscal 2017 was a year of exploration and experimentation, and we are continuing to test several concepts around the country that we believe have the potential to be compelling customer experiences; we expect to launch some of these concepts in fiscal 2018.
best buy 2020: building the new blue in november 2012, we introduced our transformation strategy called renew blue. since then we have stabilized comparable sales and increased our profitability. a little more than four years later, we have now completed renew blue and unveiled a new strategy: best buy 2020: building the new blue.
our customers are at the core of best buy 2020. technology continues to evolve, creating more excitement and opening up an increasing range of possibilities for our customers. it is also creating more complexity and we believe many of our customers need our help. our purpose is to help customers pursue their passions and enrich their lives with the help of technology. we want to play two roles for them: be their trusted adviser and solution provider; and be their source for technology services for their home. our customer value proposition is to be the leading technology expert who makes it easy for our customers to learn about and confidently enjoy the best technology.
from a financial standpoint, we seek to gradually grow our revenue, pursue ongoing cost savings necessary to both offset inflationary pressures and fund investments and build a more predictable set of revenue streams built on more recurring revenues and stickier customer relationships. there are three growth pillars we will be pursuing as part of best buy 2020:
1.   maximize the multi-channel retail business by continuing to enhance the customer experience, investing in growth of certain key product categories and developing broader and stickier customer relationships;
2.   provide services and solutions that solve real customer needs and help us build deeper customer relationships - for example, by meeting the significant technical support needs of our customers and providing more complete solutions such as security monitoring and home automation services as well as the associated products; and
3.   accelerate growth in our international segment, which consists of canada and mexico.
with the launch of best buy 2020, fiscal 2018 will revolve around the following four priorities:
1.   driving growth from the pillars described above; for example:
•   we will continue to innovate our digital capabilities to effectively help our customers in their shopping journey;
27
•   we will pursue growth around key product categories, including emerging product categories like connected home, appliances where we believe we can continue to grow revenue and mobile where we have the opportunity to return to growth by providing a more compelling experience to our customers;
•   we plan to expand our in-home advisor program ("iha") to more markets. with our iha program, customers receive a free in-home consultation with an experienced technology advisor who can identify their needs, design personalized solutions and become a personal resource over time;
•   we will continue to test new concepts around the country that have the potential to be compelling customer experiences. we have a pipeline of opportunities, some of which we will expect to expand later in fiscal 2018; and
•   we will pursue growth in our international segment by continuing to drive our online channel and by expanding the launch of the successful store remodels in canada and opening nine new stores in mexico over the next two years.
2.   the second priority is to improve our execution in key areas. we believe we continue to have significant opportunities from improving our sales effectiveness and proficiency, our supply chain for large product fulfillment and small package delivery and our services fulfillment capabilities.
3.   the third priority is to continue to reduce costs and drive efficiencies through the business. as stated previously, we have achieved $350 million of our current $400 million cost reduction target. we are working on the next phase of cost savings and will provide updates on the next goal once we complete our current program.
4.   the fourth priority is to build the capabilities necessary to deliver on the first three priorities, which will involve making investments in people and systems to drive growth, execution and efficiencies.
results of operations in order to align our fiscal reporting periods and comply with statutory filing requirements, we consolidate the financial results of our mexico operations on a one-month lag. consistent with such consolidation, the financial and non-financial information presented in our md&a relative to these operations is also presented on a lag. our policy is to accelerate the recording of events occurring in the lag period that significantly affect our consolidated financial statements. no such events were identified for the periods presented.
the results of jiangsu five star appliance co., limited ("five star"), in our international segment, are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of earnings. unless otherwise stated, financial results discussed herein refer to continuing operations.

(1)   the canadian brand consolidation that was initiated in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 had a material impact on a year-over-year basis on the canadian retail stores and website. as such, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 through the third quarter of fiscal 2017, all store and website revenue was removed from the comparable sales base, and an international segment (comprised of canada and mexico) comparable sales metric has not been provided. therefore, consolidated comparable sales for fiscal 2017 include revenue from continuing operations in the domestic segment for the full year and the international segment for the fourth quarter only, and consolidated comparable sales for fiscal 2016 equal the domestic segment comparable sales.
(2)   represents comparable sales, excluding the estimated revenue benefit from installment billing. in fiscal 2015, we began selling installment billing plans offered by mobile carriers to our customers to complement the more traditional two-year plans. while the two types of contracts have broadly similar overall economics, installment billing plans typically generate higher revenues due to higher proceeds for devices and higher cost of sales due to lower device subsidies. as we increased our mix of installment billing plans, we had an associated increase in revenue and cost of goods sold and a decrease in gross profit rate, with gross profit dollars relatively unaffected. this change in plan offer did not impact our international segment. beginning in fiscal 2017, we no longer reported comparable sales, excluding the estimated revenue benefit from installment billing, as the mix of installment billing plans became comparable on a year-over-year basis.
(3)   because retailers vary in how they record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of goods sold and sg&amp;a, our gross profit rate and sg&amp;a rate may not be comparable to other retailers' corresponding rates. for additional information regarding costs classified in cost of goods sold and sg&amp;a, refer to note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k.
(4)   includes both gain (loss) from discontinued operations and net earnings from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests.
in addition, we generated $2.5 billion in operating cash flow in fiscal 2017, compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2016, and we ended fiscal 2017 with $3.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, compared to $3.3 billion at the end of fiscal 2016. during fiscal 2017, we made four regular dividend and one special dividend payments totaling $1.57 per share, or $505 million in the aggregate.

fiscal 2017 results compared with fiscal 2016
consolidated revenue of $39.4 billion in fiscal 2017 decreased 0.3% compared to fiscal 2016. the components of the 0.3% revenue decrease in fiscal 2017 were as follows:
impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations   (0.2   )%
non-comparable sales(1)                                 (0.3   )%
comparable sales impact                                  0.2   %
total revenue decrease                                  (0.3   )%
(1)   non-comparable sales reflects the impact of revenue in our international segment for the first through third quarters of fiscal 2017, net store opening and closing activity, as well as, the impact of revenue streams not included within our comparable sales calculation, such as profit share revenue, certain credit card revenue, gift card breakage and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers, as applicable.
our gross profit rate increased 0.7% of revenue in fiscal 2017. our domestic segment contributed a rate increase of 0.5% of revenue, while our international segment contributed 0.2%. for further discussion of each segment's gross profit rate changes, see segment performance summary, below.
the sg&a rate remained flat on a year-over-year basis with both our domestic and international segments contributing flat year-over-year sg&a as a percentage of revenue. for further discussion of each segment's sg&a rate changes, see segment performance summary, below.
sg&a restructuring charges decreased from $198 million in fiscal 2016 to $39 million in fiscal 2017. the fiscal 2017 activity primarily related to our domestic segment, while our fiscal 2016 activity was driven by our international segment. for further discussion of each segment's sg&a restructuring charges, see segment performance summary, below.
our operating income increased $479 million, and our operating income as a percent of revenue increased to 4.7% of revenue in fiscal 2017, compared to operating income of 3.5% of revenue in fiscal 2016. the increase in our operating income was primarily due to an increase in our gross profit rate and a decrease in our restructuring activity.
fiscal 2016 results compared with fiscal 2015
the components of the 2.0% revenue decrease in fiscal 2016 were as follows:
impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations   (1.3   )%
non-comparable sales(1)                                 (1.1   )%
comparable sales impact                                  0.4   %
total revenue decrease                                  (2.0   )%
(1)   non-comparable sales reflects the impact of revenue in our international segment, net store opening and closing activity, as well as, the impact of revenue streams not included within our comparable sales calculation, such as profit share revenue, certain credit card revenue, gift card breakage and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers, as applicable.
our gross profit rate increased 0.9% of revenue in fiscal 2016. our domestic segment contributed a rate increase of 0.9% of revenue and there was no change in our international segment. for further discussion of each segment's gross profit rate changes, see segment performance summary, below.
the sg&a rate increased 0.5% of revenue in fiscal 2016. our domestic segment contributed a rate increase of 0.5% of revenue and there was no change in our international segment. for further discussion of each segment's sg&a rate changes, see segment performance summary, below.
sg&a restructuring charges increased from $5 million in fiscal 2015 to $198 million in fiscal 2016. our international segment drove this increase. for further discussion of each segment's sg&a restructuring charges, see segment performance summary, below.
our operating income decreased $75 million, and our operating income as a percent of revenue decreased to 3.5% of revenue in fiscal 2016, compared to operating income of 3.6% of revenue in fiscal 2015. the decrease in our operating income was primarily due to an increase in restructuring charges partially offset by net crt/lcd legal settlement proceeds received in fiscal 2016.

(1)   comparable online sales gain is included in the total comparable sales gain (decline).
(2)   represents comparable sales, excluding the estimated revenue benefit from installment billing. in fiscal 2015, we began selling installment billing plans offered by mobile carriers to our customers to complement the more traditional two-year plans. while the two types of contracts have broadly similar overall economics, installment billing plans typically generate higher revenues due to higher proceeds for devices and higher cost of sales due to lower device subsidies. as we increased our mix of installment billing plans, we had an associated increase in revenue and cost of goods sold and a decrease in gross profit rate, with gross profit dollars relatively unaffected. beginning in fiscal 2017, we no longer reported comparable sales, excluding the estimated revenue benefit from installment billing, as the mix of installment billing plans became comparable on a year-over-year basis.

fiscal 2017 results compared with fiscal 2016
domestic segment revenue of $36.2 billion in fiscal 2017 decreased 0.3% compared to the prior year. the components of the 0.3% revenue decrease in the domestic segment in fiscal 2017 were as follows:
comparable sales impact    0.2   %
non-comparable sales(1)   (0.5   )%
total revenue decrease    (0.3   )%
31
(1)   non-comparable sales reflects the impact of net store opening and closing activity, as well as the impact of revenue streams not included within our comparable sales calculation, such as profit share revenue, credit card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers.
the net store changes did not have a material impact on our revenue in fiscal 2017, as the majority of closures related to our small-format best buy mobile stand-alone stores. the closing of small-format best buy mobile stores have a significantly smaller impact given their smaller size and limited category focus compared to our large-format stores.
the profit-share revenue included in our non-comparable sales relate to our extended warranty protection plans that are managed by a third party underwriter. we may be eligible to receive profit-sharing payments, depending on the performance of the portfolio. when performance of the portfolio is strong and the claims cost to the third party underwriter declines, we are entitled to share in the excess premiums. in fiscal 2017, we recognized $110 million of such profit-share revenue, with an equal impact to gross profit and operating income.  in fiscal 2016, we recognized $148 million. the fiscal 2017 profit-share revenue decrease from fiscal 2016 reflects reductions to the premiums that we pay to the third party underwriter. in light of the continued impact of these lower premiums, we expect the profit share payments to continue to decrease in future periods.
in fiscal 2017, domestic segment online revenue of $4.8 billion increased 20.8% on a comparable basis primarily due to higher conversion rates and increased traffic. as a percentage of total domestic revenue, online revenue increased 240 basis points to 13.4% versus 11.0% last year.

the following is a description of the notable comparable sales changes in our domestic segment by revenue category:
•   consumer electronics: the 5.0% comparable sales increase was primarily due to an increase in the sales of connected home products, streaming devices and large screen televisions.
•   computing and mobile phones: the 1.8% comparable sales decline was primarily due to continued industry declines in tablets and product constraints in, and to a lesser effect, lower sales of mobile phones. this decline was partially offset by an increase in the sale of computers.
•   entertainment: the 13.8% comparable sales decrease was driven by declines in gaming, music and movies due to continued industry declines.
•   appliances: the 7.8% comparable sales gain was a result of continued growth in both large and small appliance sales.
•   services: the 3.3% comparable sales decline was primarily due to lower reimbursement revenue from our third party underwriter on extended protection plan claims. this trend, which primarily related to mobile phones, was a reflection of changes to the design of our extended protection plans in fiscal 2016, improvements to our repair and fulfillment operations and industry trends.
our domestic segment experienced an increase in gross profit rate to 23.9% in fiscal 2017 from 23.3% in fiscal 2016. this rate increase was primarily due to (1) rate improvements in computing hardware, and (2) an increase in crt legal settlements, partially offset by (1) lower margins from mobile phones due to changes in device mix, and (2) a decrease in our periodic profit share revenue as described above.
our domestic segment sg&a rate slightly decreased to 18.9% of revenue in fiscal 2017 compared to 19.0% of revenue in the prior year. the decrease in rate was primarily driven by cost reductions and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by investments in growth initiatives.
32
our domestic segment recorded $31 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2017 and incurred $2 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2016. the restructuring charges in fiscal 2017 related to the renew blue phase 2 plan that began in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. refer to note 4, restructuring charges, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for further information about our restructuring activities.
our domestic segment's operating income increased $179 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. in addition, the operating income rate increased to 4.9% of revenue in fiscal 2017 compared to 4.4% of revenue in the prior year. the increase was driven by the revenue, gross profit rate and sg&a rate improvements described above.
fiscal 2016 results compared with fiscal 2015
domestic segment revenue of $36.4 billion in fiscal 2016 increased 0.9% compared to the prior year. this increase was primarily driven by a comparable sales growth of 0.5%, which included an estimated 0.6% of revenue benefit associated with installment billing, and a periodic profit sharing benefit based on performance of our externally managed extended service plan portfolio.
similar to fiscal 2017, we recognized $148 million of profit-share revenue in fiscal 2016, with an equal impact to gross profit and operating income. the amount recognized in fiscal 2016 was substantially higher than for prior periods. the unusually strong performance of the portfolio for fiscal 2016, which particularly related to mobile phones, was due to changes to the design of our extended service plans, improvements to our repair and fulfillment operations and industry trends. these trends have also led to lower revenues from repairs we undertake on behalf of the insurers, as discussed further below.
domestic segment online revenue of $4.0 billion increased 13.5% on a comparable basis primarily due to higher conversion rates and increased traffic. as a percentage of total domestic revenue, online revenue increased 120 basis points to 11.0% versus 9.8% in fiscal 2015.
the components of the 0.9% revenue increase in the domestic segment in fiscal 2016 were as follows:
comparable sales impact   0.5   %
non-comparable sales(1)   0.4   %
total revenue increase    0.9   %
(1)   non-comparable sales reflects the impact of revenue streams not included within our comparable sales calculation, such as credit card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers.
the net store changes did not have a material impact on our revenue in fiscal 2016, as the majority of closures occurred in the fourth quarter and related to our small-format best buy mobile stand-alone stores. the closing of small-format best buy mobile stores have a significantly smaller impact given their smaller size and limited category focus compared to our large-format stores.

the following is a description of the notable comparable sales changes in our domestic segment by revenue category:
33
•   consumer electronics: the 4.7% comparable sales increase was primarily due to an increase in the sales of large screen televisions, the expansion of magnolia design center stores-within-a-store, and expanded assortment of streaming devices. this increase was partially offset by industry declines in point and shoot cameras and lower sales in small and mid-size televisions.
•   computing and mobile phones: the 2.6% comparable sales decline was primarily due to continued industry declines in tablets and to a lesser extent lower demand for mobile phones.
•   entertainment: the 3.6% comparable sales decrease was driven by declines in music and movies due to continued industry declines as well as declines in gaming hardware.
•   appliances: the 15.4% comparable sales gain was a result of continued growth in major appliances sales as well as the expansion of pacific kitchen &amp; home stores-within-a-store.
•   services: the 11.6% comparable sales decline was primarily due to lower repair revenue from extended protection plan claims. this trend, which primarily related to mobile phones, was a reflection of changes to the design of our extended protection plans, improvements to our repair and fulfillment operations and industry trends.
our domestic segment experienced an increase in gross profit of $404 million, or 5.0%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. excluding the $88 million of crt/lcd litigation settlement proceeds received in fiscal 2016, we experienced an increase in gross profit of $316 million, or 3.9%. refer to note 12, contingencies and commitments, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information. this rate increase was primarily due to (1) the periodic profit-share revenue described above; (2) rate improvements in computing hardware driven by our more disciplined promotional strategy; (3) an additional positive mix shift due to significantly decreased revenue in the lower-margin tablet category; (4) the positive impact of lower repair revenue (as discussed above), which typically earns a low gross profit rate; (5) an increased mix of higher-margin large screen televisions; and (6) positive revenue impact related to our credit card portfolio. these increases were partially offset by (1) lower rates related to large appliances; (2) a lower rate in the mobile category driven by increased sales of higher priced iconic mobile phones, which have higher gross profit dollars but carry a lower gross profit rate; (3) decrease in margin for portable audio products; (4) a decreased mix of higher-margin digital imaging products; (5) an increased mix of lower-margin wearable devices; and (6) an investment in services pricing.
our domestic segment's sg&a increased $258 million, or 3.9%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. in addition, the sg&a rate increased to 19.0% of revenue compared to 18.4% of revenue in the prior year. the increases in sg&a and sg&a rate were primarily driven by investments in growth initiatives, a greater portion of our vendor funding being recorded as an offset to cost of goods sold rather than sg&a and higher incentive compensation. this increase was partially offset by the implementation of renew blue phase 2 cost reductions.
our domestic segment recorded $2 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2016 and incurred $4 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2015. the restructuring charges had an immaterial impact on our operating income rate in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. refer to note 4, restructuring charges, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for further information about our restructuring activities.
our domestic segment's operating income increased $148 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. in addition, the operating income rate increased to 4.4% of revenue in fiscal 2016 compared to 4.0% of revenue in the prior year. the increase was driven by higher revenue and margin and $75 million in net crt/lcd litigation settlement proceeds received in fiscal 2016, partially offset by the increase in sg&a as described above.
international segment during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we consolidated the future shop and best buy stores and websites in canada under the best buy brand. this resulted in the permanent closure of 66 future shop stores and the conversion of the remaining 65 future shop stores to the best buy brand. the costs of implementing these changes primarily consisted of lease exit costs, a tradename impairment, property and equipment impairments, employee termination benefits and inventory write-downs.

(1)   the canadian brand consolidation has a material impact on a year-over-year basis on the canadian retail stores and the website. as such, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 through the third quarter of fiscal 2017, all store and website revenue was removed from the comparable sales base, and an international segment (comprised of canada and mexico) comparable sales metric for the full year has not been provided. international comparable sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was 0.9%.

as noted above, comparable sales information has not been provided for the international segment for fiscal 2017 or 2016 due to the canadian brand consolidation. as such, it is also impractical to provide such information on a revenue category basis. however, as noted above, the revenue mix by category has not changed significantly from fiscal 2016.
our international segment experienced a gross profit increase of $83 million, or 11.7%, in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the increase in gross profit was $98 million. the gross profit rate increased to 25.0% in fiscal 2017 from 22.4% of revenue in fiscal 2016. this increase was primarily due to the increased promotional activity in fiscal 2016 as a result of the canada brand consolidation which did not reoccur and to a lesser extent rate growth in computing and home theater.
our international segment's sg&a decreased $29 million, or 4.0%, in fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year. excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the decrease in sg&a was $9 million. the sg&a rate decreased to 21.9% in fiscal 2017 from 22.8% of revenue in fiscal 2016. the decrease in sg&a rate was driven by year-over-year sales leverage.
our international segment recorded $8 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2017 and incurred $199 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2016. the fiscal 2017 restructuring charges related to adjustments to our vacant space liabilities outstanding as a result of the canadian brand consolidation and the renew blue plan. the adjustments were due to changes in estimates related to sublease income. the fiscal 2016 restructuring charges primarily related to the canadian brand consolidation and consisted of facility closure costs, tradename impairments, property and equipment impairments, and employee termination benefits. refer to note 4, restructuring charges, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for further information about our restructuring activities.
our international segment operating income was $90 million in fiscal 2017 compared to a loss of $210 million in the prior-year period. the improvement in operating income was primarily driven by lower restructuring costs and gross profit and sg&a rate improvements.
fiscal 2016 results compared with fiscal 2015
in our international segment, revenue declined 26.2% to $3.2 billion in fiscal 2016 due to (1) the loss of revenue associated with closed stores as part of the canadian brand consolidation; (2) a negative foreign currency impact of 12.5%; and (3) ongoing softness in the canadian economy and consumer electronics industry.
the components of the international segment's 26.2% revenue decrease in fiscal 2016 were as follows:
impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations   (12.5   )%
non-comparable sales(1)                                 (13.7   )%

as noted above, comparable sales information has not been provided for the international segment for fiscal 2016 due to the canadian brand consolidation. as such, it is also impractical to provide such information on a revenue category basis. however, as noted above, the revenue mix by category has not changed significantly from fiscal 2015.
our international segment experienced a gross profit decline of $260 million, or 26.9%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the decrease in gross profit was $141 million. the gross profit rate declined to 22.4% of revenue in fiscal 2016 from 22.6% of revenue in fiscal 2015. this decline was primarily due to the disruptive impacts from the canadian brand consolidation and increased promotional activity in canada.
our international segment's sg&a decreased $232 million, or 24.3%, in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year. excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the decrease in sg&a was $115 million. however, the sg&a expense rate increased to 22.8% of revenue in fiscal 2016 from 22.2% of revenue in fiscal 2015. the decrease in sg&a expense was driven by the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the canadian brand consolidation. the increase in the sg&a rate was driven by year-over-year sales deleverage.
our international segment recorded $199 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2016 and incurred $1 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2015. the fiscal 2016 restructuring charges primarily related to the canadian brand consolidation and consisted of facility closure costs, tradename impairments, property and equipment impairments, and employee termination benefits. the restructuring charges in fiscal 2015 had an immaterial impact on our operating income rate. refer to note 4, restructuring charges, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for further information about our restructuring activities.
our international segment operating loss was $210 million in fiscal 2016 compared to income of $13 million in the prior-year period. the decline in operating income was driven primarily by a decrease in revenue and gross profit rate and restructuring charges, partially offset by lower sg&a expenses as described above.
additional consolidated results other income (expense)
in fiscal 2017, our gain on sale of investments was $3 million compared to $2 million and $13 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. these gains were due to the sale of cost-based investments.
in fiscal 2017, our investment income and other was $31 million, compared to $13 million in fiscal 2016. the increase in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher interest rates in the u.s. in fiscal 2016, our investment income and other was $13 million, compared to $14 million in fiscal 2015. the decrease in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower interest rates in canada and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.
interest expense was $72 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $80 million in fiscal 2016 due to a lower debt balance for a majority of the year caused by the march 2016 payment of our $350 million principal amount notes. interest expense was $80 million in fiscal 2016, compared to $90 million in fiscal 2015. the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to swapping a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate, which was lower than our fixed rate. refer to note 6, derivative instruments, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
37
income tax expense income tax expense increased to $609 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $503 million in fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in pre-tax earnings, partially offset by a higher mix of pre-tax income from foreign operations and the resolution of certain tax matters in the current year. our effective income tax rate ("etr") for fiscal 2017 was 33.5%, compared to a rate of 38.4% in fiscal 2016. the decrease in the etr was primarily due to a higher mix of pre-tax income from foreign operations and the resolution of certain tax matters in the current year.
income tax expense increased to $503 million in fiscal 2016, compared to a tax expense of $141 million in fiscal 2015, primarily due to a $353 million discrete benefit related to reorganizing certain european legal entities in fiscal 2015, as well as a lower mix of pre-tax earnings from foreign operations in fiscal 2016, partially offset by a decrease in pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2016. our etr for fiscal 2016 was 38.4%, compared to a rate of 10.1% in fiscal 2015. excluding the impact of reorganizing certain european legal entities, the etr would have been 35.6% in fiscal 2015. refer to note 10, income taxes, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
our consolidated etr is impacted by the statutory income tax rates applicable to each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. as our foreign earnings are generally taxed at lower statutory rates than the 35.0% u.s. federal statutory rate, changes in the proportion of our consolidated taxable earnings originating in foreign jurisdictions impact our consolidated effective rate. our foreign earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. and are not subject to current u.s. income tax.
discontinued operations discontinued operations are primarily comprised of five star within our international segment. gain from discontinued operations in fiscal 2017 was $21 million primarily related to the sale of the remaining five star property assets that were held for sale as of january 30, 2016. gain from discontinued operations in fiscal 2016 of $90 million was primarily related to the gain recognized on the sale of five star. loss from discontinued operations of $11 million in fiscal 2015 was driven by other charges related to five star.

(6)   income tax impact of non-gaap adjustments is the summation of the calculated income tax charge related to each non-gaap non-income tax adjustment. the non-gaap adjustments relate primarily to adjustments in the united states and canada. as such, the income tax charge is calculated using the statutory rates of 38.0% for the united states and 26.4% for canada, applied to the non-gaap adjustments of each country.
non-gaap operating income for fiscal 2017 increased $193 million compared to fiscal 2016, and non-gaap operating income as a percent of revenue increased to 4.5%. the increase was driven by increased consolidated gross profit rate and continued sg&a cost reductions in both segments primarily due to the realization of our renew blue phase 2 cost reduction initiatives and tighter expense management. the increase in non-gaap operating income resulted in a year-over-year increase in non-gaap net earnings from continuing operations and non-gaap diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.
non-gaap operating income for fiscal 2016 increased $69 million compared to fiscal 2015. the increase was driven by increased revenue in the domestic segment, increased consolidated gross profit rate and continued sg&a cost reductions in both segments primarily due to the realization of our renew blue phase 2 cost reduction initiatives and tighter expense management. the increase in non-gaap operating income resulted in a year-over-year increase in non-gaap net earnings from continuing operations and non-gaap diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.
liquidity and capital resources summary we closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment required to support our business strategies, the performance of our business, capital expenditures, credit facilities and short-term borrowing arrangements and working capital management. capital expenditures and share repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment. we have a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our renew blue and best buy 2020: building the new blue strategies.

operating activities the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the timing of inventory purchasing and payments and increased earnings. during fiscal 2017 we purchased and paid for inventory later in the holiday season than in the prior year, discussed below, positively impacting operating cash flows. this was partially offset by the timing of collection of receivables.
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the timing of inventory receipts and income tax payments. during fiscal 2016, we decided to bring holiday inventory in early and the super bowl shifted to the first quarter of fiscal 2016, which caused us to hold our inventory longer and settle our accounts payable related to that inventory prior to year-end. in addition, we paid more income taxes in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the timing of when payments were made.
investing activities the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the net investment into short-term investments in fiscal 2017.
the decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to increased sales of short-term investments partially offset by capital expenditures (see capital expenditures below).
financing activities the decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a decline in the number of shares repurchased, which was substantially offset by the repayment of our $350 million principal amount of notes due march 15, 2016.
the increase in cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to share repurchases and dividend payments. in fiscal 2016, we purchased $1.0 billion of common stock as part of our june 2011 share repurchase program. in addition, we increased our normal dividend from 2015 to 2016 and paid a special dividend in 2016.
sources of liquidity funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, our credit facilities, and other debt arrangements are our most significant sources of liquidity. we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures, strategic initiatives, share repurchases and dividends. however, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending. there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms.
on june 26, 2016, we entered into a $1.25 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "five-year facility agreement") with a syndicate of banks. the five-year facility agreement replaced the previous $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the "previous facility"), which was originally scheduled to expire in june 2019, but was terminated on june 27, 2016. the five-year facility agreement permits borrowings up to $1.25 billion and expires in june 2021. at january
41
28, 2017, and january 30, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding under the five-year facility agreement nor its predecessor the previous facility. refer to note 5, debt, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for further information about our credit facilities.
our ability to access our revolving credit facility under the five-year facility agreement is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the facility, including financial covenants. the financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios. at january 28, 2017, we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. if an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt, it would likely constitute an event of default under our facilities as well.
an interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pre-tax earnings before fixed charges (interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense) to fixed charges. our interest coverage ratio, calculated as reported in exhibit no. 12.1 of this annual report on form 10-k, was 6.97 and 5.16 in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.
our credit ratings and outlooks at march 20, 2017, are summarized below. in fiscal 2017, standard & poor's rating services upgraded its long-term credit rating from bb+ to bbb- with a stable outlook; moody's investors service, inc. affirmed its long-term credit rating of baa1 with a stable outlook; and fitch ratings limited affirmed its long-term credit rating of bbb- with a stable outlook.

restricted cash our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for general liability insurance and workers' compensation insurance. restricted cash and cash equivalents related to our continuing operations, which are included in other current assets, remained relatively flat at $193 million and $185 million at january 28, 2017, and january 30, 2016, respectively.
capital expenditures our capital expenditures typically include investments in our stores, distribution capabilities and information technology enhancements (including e-commerce). during fiscal 2017, we invested $582 million in property and equipment, primarily related to upgrading our information technology systems and capabilities and store-related projects.
the following table presents our capital expenditures for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions):
2017                                                             2016              2015

(2)   excludes $10 million for fiscal 2015 related to five star.
(3)   total capital expenditures exclude non-cash capital expenditures of $48 million, $92 million and $14 million for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. non-cash capital expenditures are comprised of capitalized leases, as well as additions to property and equipment included in accounts payable.
42
in fiscal 2018, we estimate cash capital expenditures of approximately $650 million to $700 million, with the focus on retail store, e-commerce and information technology projects.
debt and capital in march 2016, we repaid our $350 million principal amount of notes due march 15, 2016 (the "2016 notes"), using existing cash resources. as of january 28, 2017, we have $500 million principal amount of notes due august 1, 2018 (the "2018 notes") and $650 million principal amount of notes due march 15, 2021 (the "2021 notes") outstanding. refer to note 5, debt, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for further information about our 2016 notes, 2018 notes and 2021 notes.
share repurchases and dividends we repurchase our common stock and pay dividends pursuant to programs approved by our board of directors ("board"). our long-term capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investments in growth and then return excess cash over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investment grade credit metrics.
on march 1, 2017, we announced our intent to repurchase $3.0 billion shares over the next two years. in order to execute this plan, our board approved a new $5.0 billion share repurchase authorization in february 2017. this share repurchase program supersedes the previous $5.0 billion authorization dated june 2011, which had $2.2 billion remaining as of january 28, 2017. there is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under the february 2017 share repurchase program. repurchased shares are retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares.
the following table presents our share repurchase history for each of the past three fiscal years (in millions, except per share amounts):
2017                                                          2016(1)            2015

in fiscal 2004, our board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on common stock. a quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter. the payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. the following table presents our dividend activity for each of the past three fiscal years (in millions, except per share amounts):
2017                                                                  2016   2015

total cash dividends per share                 $1.57             $1.43             $0.72
cash dividends declared and paid                $505              $499              $251
(1)   special cash dividends are authorized by our board of directors and issued upon their discretion. dividend paid in fiscal 2017 related to the net after-tax proceeds from certain legal settlements and asset disposals, while the dividends paid in fiscal 2016 related to the net after-tax proceeds from lcd-related legal settlements.
dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2017 were relatively unchanged from fiscal 2016, noting that the quarterly dividend per share increased from $0.23 in fiscal 2016 to $0.28 in fiscal 2017. the increase in the regular dividend rate was substantially offset by fewer common shares, due to a return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases, and a smaller special dividend. dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2016 increased compared to the prior year due to an increase in the quarterly dividend per share increase from $0.18 in fiscal 2015 to $0.23 in fiscal 2016 and the payment of a special dividend in fiscal 2016.
on march 1, 2017, we announced a 21.0% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.34 per share.
43
other financial measures our current ratio, calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities, was 1.5 as of january 28, 2017, compared to 1.4 at the end of fiscal 2016. the higher current ratio in fiscal 2017 was driven by an increase in cash and short-term investments, related to our higher earnings, and a decrease in current portion of long-term debt related to the payment of our 2016 notes, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable related to the timing of our inventory purchases.
our debt to earnings ratio was 1.1 as of january 28, 2017, compared to 2.1 as of january 30, 2016, due to higher earnings in the current year and a reduction in debt related to the payment of our 2016 notes. our non-gaap debt to ebitdar ratio, which includes capitalized operating lease obligations in its calculation, was 1.6 and 1.8 as of january 28, 2017, and january 30, 2016, respectively. the decrease in the ratio was due to a decrease in debt and capitalized operating lease obligations and an increase in earnings.
commencing in fiscal 2017, we modified the multiple used to calculate our estimated capitalized operating lease obligation included in our non-gaap debt calculation. due to changes in the average remaining lease life of our operating lease portfolio, we have lowered the multiple used from eight times annual rent expense to five times annual rent expense. the multiple of five aligns with the multiple used by one of the nationally recognized credit rating agencies when evaluating the creditworthiness of companies within the retail sector. prior periods presented have been adjusted to use this new multiple.
our non-gaap debt to ebitdar ratio is calculated as follows:
non-gaap debt to ebitdar =   non-gaap debt non-gaap ebitdar the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to our non-gaap debt to ebitdar ratio is our debt to net earnings ratio, which excludes capitalized operating lease obligations from debt in the numerator of the calculation and does not adjust net earnings in the denominator of the calculation.
the following table presents a reconciliation of our debt to net earnings ratio to our non-gaap debt to ebitdar ratio for continuing operations ($ in millions):

(1)   debt is reflected as of the balance sheet dates for each of the respective fiscal periods, while rental expense and the other components of non-gaap ebitdar represent activity for the 12 months ended january 28, 2017 and january 30, 2016.
(2)   the multiple of five times annual rental expense in the calculation of our capitalized operating lease obligations is the multiple used for the retail sector by one of the nationally recognized credit rating agencies that rate our creditworthiness, and we consider it to be an appropriate multiple for our lease portfolio. historically, we used a capitalized lease multiple of eight times annual rent expense; however, due to changes in the average remaining lease life of our operating leases, we have lowered the multiple to five. the prior period calculation has been updated to reflect the use of the changes.
(3)   includes the impact of restructuring charges and non-restructuring asset impairments. refer to note 3, fair value measurements, and note 4, restructuring charges, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding the nature of these charges.

off-balance-sheet arrangements and contractual obligations other than operating leases, we do not have any off-balance-sheet financing. a summary of our operating lease obligations by fiscal year is included in the "contractual obligations" table below. additional information regarding our operating leases is available in item 2, properties, and note 8, leases, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k.

note: for additional information refer to note 5, debt; note 8, leases; note 10, income taxes; and note 12, contingencies and commitments, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k.
(1)   represents principal amounts only and excludes interest rate swap valuation adjustments.
(2)   interest payments related to our 2018 notes and 2021 notes include the fixed interest rate payments for the balances not impacted by our interest rate swap and the variable interest rate payments for the balances included in our interest rate swap. for additional information refer to note 6, derivative instruments, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k.
(3)   operating lease obligations do not include payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance. these charges, if included, would increase total operating lease obligations by $1.0 billion at january 28, 2017.
(4)   purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty. additionally, although they are not legally binding agreements, we included open purchase orders in the table above. substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days.
(5)   unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions. as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time, the related balances have not been reflected in the "payments due by period" section of the table.
(6)   included in long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at january 28, 2017, was a $31 million obligation for deferred compensation. as the specific payment dates for the deferred compensation are unknown, the related balances have not been reflected in the "payments due by period" section of the table.
additionally, we have $1.25 billion in undrawn capacity on our credit facilities at january 28, 2017, which if drawn upon, would be included as short-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. we base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. on a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap. however, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k. we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. these estimates require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, because they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board.
except where noted, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies for the areas described below.
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market through the establishment of markdown and inventory loss adjustments. markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net proceeds we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis. subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis. markdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding factors such as forecast consumer demand, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence.
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our markdown adjustments. however, if actual outcomes are different than we anticipated, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. a 10% change in our markdown adjustment at january 28, 2017, would have affected net earnings by approximately $8 million in fiscal 2017.
vendor allowances we receive allowances from certain vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements. we treat a substantial majority of these allowances as an offset to the cost of the product or services provided. sell-through allowances are collected when inventory is sold to customers and recognized as a reduction in cost of sales at that time. certain other types of funding, most notably receipt-based allowances, are collected when we take receipt of inventory and deferred as a reduction of inventory until inventory is sold. the estimation of the deferral for these types of funding is complex and requires detailed analysis of factors such as product and vendor mix, inventory turn and a range of allowance programs.
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our vendor funding deferral. a 10% difference in our vendor funding deferral at january 28, 2017, would have affected net earnings by approximately $23 million in fiscal 2017.
we also receive vendor allowances for achieving certain volume targets. these vendor allowances are accrued as earned over the incentive period, based on estimates of purchases or sales. amounts accrued throughout the program year could require adjustment if actual purchase or sales volumes differ from projected volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated volume tiers are met. we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases or sales over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowances to be received from our vendors. since most volume-based programs apply to a calendar year or our fiscal year, the amount of judgment required as of any fiscal year end is minimal.
property and equipment impairments property and equipment assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
when evaluating property and equipment assets with impairment indicators for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value, which is typically based on estimated discounted future cash flows. we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset's carrying value exceeds the asset's estimated fair value. if we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. for a depreciable asset, the new cost basis is depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset.
when reviewing property and equipment assets for impairment, we group assets with other assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. for assets deployed at store
46
locations, we review for impairment at the individual store level. these reviews involve comparing the carrying value of all property and equipment located at each store to the net cash flow projections for each store. in addition, we conduct separate impairment reviews at other levels as appropriate. for example, a shared asset such as a distribution center or an it asset would be evaluated by reference to the aggregate assets and projected cash flows of all areas of the businesses utilizing those shared assets.
our impairment loss calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate fair values, including estimating cash flows and useful lives and selecting a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to impairments that could be material. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate property and equipment asset impairment losses.
goodwill goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and our reporting units are the components of operating segments which constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management. our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit and is based on discounted cash flows or relative market-based approaches. if the fair value exceeds carrying value, then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss. the second step includes hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. then, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying value.
the carrying value of goodwill at january 28, 2017, was $425 million, which related entirely to our domestic segment. in fiscal 2017, we determined that the excess of fair value over carrying value was substantial. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.
tax contingencies our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. at any time, many tax years are subject to audit by various tax authorities. in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we may record a liability for such exposures. a number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions.
our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.
although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax
47
rate in the period of resolution. a favorable tax settlement may reduce our effective income tax rate and would be recognized in the period of resolution.
revenue recognition the following accounting estimates relating to revenue recognition contain uncertainty because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the effects of future events.
returns - we recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales incentives or allowances, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. we estimate the liability for sales returns with a corresponding reduction to revenue and cost of sales based on historical return data. we believe that our estimate for sales returns, which represents the estimated gross margin impact of returns, is a reasonable reflection of future returns and financial impacts. however, if our estimates are significantly below or above the actual return amounts, our reported revenue and cost of sales could be impacted. a 10% difference in our returns reserve at january 28, 2017, would have affected net earnings by approximately $2 million in fiscal 2017.
gift card breakage - we sell gift cards to customers in our retail stores, through our websites and through select third parties. a liability is initially established for the value of the gift card when sold. we recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer. for unredeemed gift cards, we recognize breakage when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is deemed remote, and we determine that we do not have a legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to a relevant jurisdiction. we determine the breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns and record projected breakage 24 months after card issuance. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to record breakage. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to a charge that could be material.
customer loyalty programs - we have customer loyalty programs which allow members to earn points for each purchase completed with us or when using our co-branded credit cards. points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases. the value of points earned by our loyalty program members is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time the points are earned, based on the value of points that are projected to be redeemed. our estimate of the amount and timing of redemptions of certificates is based primarily on historical data. a 10% difference in our customer redemption rates at january 28, 2017, would have affected net earnings by approximately $13 million in fiscal 2017.
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions of our revenue recognition critical accounting estimates. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.

item 1a.    risk factors natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business.
our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prices we receive for the natural gas and oil that we sell. lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically. historically, natural gas and oil prices have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. because our reserves are predominantly natural gas (approximately 97% of equivalent proved reserves), changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices. natural gas prices, based on the twelve-month average of the first of the month henry hub index price, were $2.48 per mmbtu in 2016 compared to $2.59 per mmbtu in 2015. oil prices, based on the nymex monthly average price, were $42.75 per barrel in 2016 compared to $50.28 per barrel in 2015, and have yet to recover to levels experienced in 2014 despite recent price improvements. low prices throughout 2015 and 2016 have had, and any substantial or extended decline in future natural gas or crude oil prices would have, a material adverse effect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and commitments. furthermore, substantial, extended decreases in natural gas and crude oil prices may cause us to delay or postpone a significant portion of our exploration, development and exploitation projects or may render such projects uneconomic, which may result in significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could negatively impact our ability to borrow and cost of capital and our ability to access capital markets, increase our costs under our revolving credit facility, and limit our ability to execute aspects of our business plans. see "risk factors-future natural gas and oil price declines may result in additional write-downs of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations."
prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. these factors include but are not limited to the following:
•   the levels and location of natural gas and oil supply and demand and expectations regarding supply and demand, including the potential long-term impact of an abundance of natural gas from shale (such as that produced from our marcellus shale properties) on the global natural gas supply;
•   the level of consumer demand for natural gas and oil;
•   weather conditions;
•   political conditions or hostilities in natural gas and oil producing regions, including the middle east, africa and south america;
•   the ability and willingness of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and other exporting nations to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;
•   the price level and quantities of foreign imports;
•   actions of governmental authorities;
•   the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, transportation, processing and/or refining facilities in regional or localized areas that may affect the realized price for natural gas and oil;
•   inventory storage levels;
•   the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation, including environmental and climate change regulation;
•   the price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels;
•   technological advances affecting energy consumption;
•   speculation by investors in oil and natural gas;
•   variations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices; and
•   overall economic conditions, including the value of the u.s. dollar relative to other major currencies.
22
these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict the future prices of natural gas and oil. if natural gas and oil prices remain low or continue to decline significantly for a sustained period of time, the lower prices may cause us to reduce our planned drilling program or adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures, raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations.
drilling natural gas and oil wells is a high-risk activity.
our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program. drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered. the cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including:
•   decreases in natural gas and oil prices;
•   unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations;
•   equipment failures or accidents;
•   adverse weather conditions;
•   surface access restrictions;
•   loss of title or other title related issues;
•   lack of available gathering or processing facilities or delays in the construction thereof;
•   compliance with, or changes in, governmental requirements and regulation, including with respect to wastewater disposal, discharge of greenhouse gases and fracturing; and
•   costs of shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment and materials.
our future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular geographic area may decline. we may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame, or at all. we may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because, in some cases, we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location. similarly, our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget. the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors, including:
•   the results of exploration efforts and the acquisition, review and analysis of seismic data;
•   the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects;
•   the approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiled;
•   economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability of drilling rigs and crews;
•   our financial resources and results; and
•   the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects and any delays in obtaining such permits.
these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells, if drilled, may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil.
23
our proved reserves are estimates. any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated.
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner. the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. the process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. the extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. the process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the sec, such as natural gas and oil prices. additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data.
results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate. accordingly, initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered, and such variances may be material. any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves. in accordance with sec requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month average index price for the respective commodity, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties. the present value of future cash flows are based on $1.74 per mcf of natural gas, $10.69 per bbl of ngls and $37.54 per bbl of oil as of december 31, 2016. actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. in addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general.
future natural gas and oil price declines may result in additional write-downs of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
the value of our oil and gas properties depends on prices of natural gas and oil. declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs, changes in well performance, delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding write-down of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties. for example, in december 2015, we recorded an impairment of approximately $114.9 million associated with oil and gas properties in certain non-core fields in south texas, east texas and louisiana. the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2015. because our reserves are predominately natural gas (approximately 97% of equivalent proved reserves), changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices.
we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a field-by-field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a property's carrying amount may not be recoverable. we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. if the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future natural gas and oil prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. in the event that commodity prices decline, there could be a significant revision in the future.
our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable.
in general, the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce, our reserves will decline, eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations. our future natural gas and oil production is, therefore, highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration, development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs. low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically.
24
our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31, 2016 will decrease at a rate of 7%, 27%, 19% and 15% during 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline. because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves, we consider this pattern fairly typical.
exploration, development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in, among other things, dry holes, the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves.
we have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all.
we rely upon access to both our revolving credit facility and longer-term capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources. future challenges in the global financial system, including the capital markets, may adversely affect our business and our financial condition. our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection. future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues.
risks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.
as of december 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.5 billion of debt outstanding and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. increases in our level of indebtedness may:
•   require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to make debt service payments, which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities;
•   limit our operating flexibility due to financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on incurring additional debt, making certain investments, and paying dividends;
•   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with lower debt service obligations;
•   depending on the levels of our outstanding debt, limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes; and
•   increase our vulnerability to downturns in our business or the economy, including declines in prices for natural gas and oil.
in addition, the interest rates that we pay on our senior unsecured notes and the margins we pay under our revolving credit facility depend on our leverage ratio and our asset coverage ratio. accordingly, increases in the amount of our indebtedness without corresponding increases in our earnings or the present value of our reserves, or decreases in our earnings or the present value of our natural gas and oil reserves without a corresponding decrease in our indebtedness, will result in an increase in our interest expense.
our debt agreements also require compliance with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios. if the price that we receive for our natural gas and oil production deteriorates from current levels or continues for an extended period, it could lead to reduced revenues, cash flow and earnings, which in turn could lead to a default under the ratios described above. because the calculations of the financial ratios are made as of certain dates, the financial ratios can fluctuate significantly from period to period. a prolonged period of decreased natural gas and oil prices could further increase the risk of our inability to comply with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios. in order to provide a margin of comfort with regard to these financial covenants, we may seek to reduce our capital expenditures, sell non-strategic assets or opportunistically modify or increase our derivative instruments to the extent permitted under our debt agreements. in addition, we may seek to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness. we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully execute any of these strategies, and such strategies may be unavailable on favorable terms or at all. for more information about our debt agreements, please read "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition - capital resources and liquidity."
the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility may be reduced, which could limit us in the future.
the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is currently $3.2 billion, and lender commitments under our revolving credit facility are $1.8 billion. the borrowing base is redetermined annually under the terms of the revolving credit facility on april 1. in addition, either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in conjunction with certain
25
acquisitions or sales of oil and gas properties. our borrowing base may decrease as a result of lower natural gas or oil prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, lending requirements or regulations, the issuance of new indebtedness or for any other reason. in the event of a decrease in our borrowing base due to declines in commodity prices or otherwise, our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility may be limited and we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base. in addition, we may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets, including the market for senior unsecured notes, to meet our obligations, including any such debt repayment obligations.
strategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging, and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate.
our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business. in developing our business plan, we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including well-development (primarily drilling), reserve acquisitions, exploratory activity, corporate items and other alternatives. we also considered our likely sources of capital. notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2017 plan, business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention, including possible acquisitions and dispositions. if we fail to identify optimal business strategies, or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies, our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected. moreover, economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2017 plan, and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives.
negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.
negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, oil spills, greenhouse gas or methane emissions and explosions of natural gas transmission lines, may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.
our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production and/or the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing.
the sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities. we deliver our natural gas and oil production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own. the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. third-party systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons. in addition, at current commodity prices, construction of new pipelines and building of such infrastructure may be slower to build out. to the extent these services are unavailable, we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production. our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business.
for example, the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates. the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells, as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells, may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available. in such event, this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity and/or natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project, which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
we are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental and safety regulations, which can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.
our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including drilling, permitting and safety laws and regulations and those relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities, and these permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal. governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations,
26
and violations could subject us to fines, injunctions or both. these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning, designing, drilling, installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities, and new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs. in addition, we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease. risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations. for example, we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness, wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas. failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders. it is possible that other developments, such as stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production, would result in substantial costs and liabilities.
acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits, as well as potential liabilities.
successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control. these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future natural gas and oil prices, operating costs, production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities. these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise. our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems. in addition, our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties. we do not inspect every well, and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural, subsurface, or environmental problems that may exist or arise.
there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. we often assume certain liabilities, and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, and our contractual indemnification may not be effective. at times, we acquire interests in properties on an "as is" basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties. in addition, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties.
the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult, and may divert management's attention away from our existing operations.
the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult, and may divert management's attention and financial resources away from our existing operations. these difficulties include:
•   the challenge of integrating the acquired properties while carrying on the ongoing operations of our business;
•   the inability to retain key employees of the acquired business;
•   potential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired properties; and
•   the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations.
the process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business. if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.
we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses.
our business involves a variety of operating risks, including:
•   well site blowouts, cratering and explosions;
•   equipment failures;
•   pipe or cement failures and casing collapses, which can release natural gas, oil, drilling fluids or hydraulic fracturing fluids;
•   uncontrolled flows of natural gas, oil or well fluids;
27
•   pipeline ruptures;
•   fires;
•   formations with abnormal pressures;
•   handling and disposal of materials, including drilling fluids and hydraulic fracturing fluids;
•   release of toxic gas;
•   buildup of naturally occurring radioactive materials;
•   pollution and other environmental risks, including conditions caused by previous owners or lessors of our properties; and
•   natural disasters.
any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life, loss of hydrocarbons, significant damage to or destruction of property, environmental pollution, regulatory investigations and penalties, suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us.
our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks, including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures. the location of pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase these risks. as of december 31, 2016, we owned or operated approximately 3,100 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems. as part of our normal maintenance program, we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair, replacement or additional maintenance.
we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed.
we maintain insurance against some, but not all, operating risks and losses. we do not carry business interruption insurance. in addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.
other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. as of december 31, 2016, non-operated wells represented approximately 6.5% of our total owned gross wells, or approximately 1.9% of our owned net wells. we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non-operated properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, an operator's breach of the applicable agreements or an operator's failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues. our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs.
competition in our industry is intense, and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do, which could adversely affect our competitive position.
competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense. major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties, as well as for the capital, equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties. our competitive position is affected by price, contract terms and quality of service, including pipeline connection times, distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record. many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours. these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. in addition, these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry. these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation.
28
we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil.
from time to time, when we believe that market conditions are favorable, we use financial derivative instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production. while there are many different types of derivatives available, we generally utilize collar, swap and basis swap agreements to manage price risk more effectively.
the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period. they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor. the swap agreements call for payments to, or receipts from, counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place. these arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices. in addition, these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances, including when:
•   there is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our production;
•   production is less than expected; or
•   a counterparty is unable to satisfy its obligations.
the cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions. these regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties. while we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements, the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps, materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions and/or reduce the availability of new or existing swaps. if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the dodd-frank act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable.
we will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future. please read "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7 and "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives.
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate.
our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel, and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment. the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us. in addition, our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists, engineers and other professionals. competition for experienced geologists, engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense. if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.
federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development, including hydraulic fracturing, could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays.
most of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells. this technology involves the injection of fluids-usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives-as well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore. most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well. hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs; however, the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the safe drinking water act and has released permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where epa is the permitting authority, including pennsylvania. as a result, we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations. these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive. in addition, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in congress that would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids. if enacted, this legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal, state or local levels, and could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely
29
affect the environment, including groundwater, soil or surface water. moreover, in may 2014, the epa announced an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the toxic substances control act relating to data collection, including the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. further, in march 2015, the department of the interior's bureau of land management (blm) issued a final rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and indian land; however, in june 2016, a wyoming federal judge struck down this final rule, finding that the blm lacked authority to promulgate the rule. this decision is currently being appealed by the federal government. we voluntarily disclose on a well-by-well basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at www.fracfocus.org.
in addition, state and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. when caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. in march 2016, the united states geological survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including oklahoma, kansas, texas, colorado, new mexico, and arkansas. in light of these concerns, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity. certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal, state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. we cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal, which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities, including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing.
on august 16, 2012, the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production, processing and transportation activities, including nsps to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities. in june 2016, the epa published a final rule that updates and expands the nsps by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry. in addition, the epa has announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing sources and has issued information collection requests for oil and natural gas facilities. the epa also published a final rule in june 2016 concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry.
compliance with these requirements, especially the new methane regulation, may require modifications to certain of our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business. similarly, aggregating our oil and gas facilities for permitting could result in more complex, costly, and time consuming air permitting. particularly in regard to obtaining pre-construction permits, the final aggregation rule could add costs and cause delays in our operations.
in addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals, some states in which we operate, such as pennsylvania, west virginia and texas, and certain local governments have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, including requirements regarding chemical disclosure, casing and cementing of wells, withdrawal of water for use in high-volume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells, baseline testing of nearby water wells, and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. for example, the city of denton, texas adopted a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in november 2014, though it was later lifted in 2015, and new york issued a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing in june 2015. in addition, pennsylvania's act 13 of 2012 became law on february 14, 2012 and amended the state's oil and gas act to, among other things, increase civil penalties and strengthen the pennsylvania department of environmental protection's (padep) authority over the issuance of drilling permits. although the pennsylvania supreme court struck down portions of act 13 that made statewide rules on oil and gas preempt local zoning rules, this could lead to additional local restrictions on oil and gas activity in the state. the pennsylvania supreme court heard additional challenges to act 13 and struck several more provisions in september 2016, including the provision requiring notification of spills and leaks only to public water suppliers.
we use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations. our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations. moreover, new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas. compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. for example, in april 2011, padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19, 2011
30
delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padep's total dissolved solids regulations. in june 2016, the epa published final pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works (potws). the regulations were developed under the epa's effluent guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act. in response to these actions, operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposal.
a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices. for example, the epa conducted a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. the epa released its final report in december 2016. it concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical integrity of wells. this study and other studies that may be undertaken by epa or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act, the toxic substances control act, or other statutory and/or regulatory mechanisms.
climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.
climate change, the costs that may be associated with its effects, and the regulation of greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions have the potential to affect our business in many ways, including increasing the costs to provide our products and services, reducing the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and the economic health of the regions in which we operate, all of which can create financial risks. in addition, legislative and regulatory responses related to ghg emissions and climate change may increase our operating costs. the united states congress has previously considered legislation related to ghg emissions. there have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in ghg emissions. the united states was actively involved in the negotiations at the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris, which led to the creation of the paris agreement. the paris agreement requires countries to review and "represent a progression" in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years. the united states signed the paris agreement in april 2016. increased public awareness and concern may result in more state, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate ghg emissions.
in september 2009, the epa finalized a mandatory ghg reporting rule that requires large sources of ghg emissions to monitor, maintain records on, and annually report their ghg emissions beginning january 1, 2010. the rule applies to large facilities emitting 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide-equivalent (co2e) emissions per year and to most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels, as well as manufacturers of vehicles and engines. subsequently, in november 2010, the epa issued ghg monitoring and reporting regulations that went into effect on december 30, 2010, specifically for oil and natural gas facilities, including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of co2e per year. the rule required reporting of ghg emissions by regulated facilities to the epa by march 2012 for emissions during 2011 and annually thereafter. we are required to report our ghg emissions to the epa each year in march under this rule and have submitted our annual reports in compliance with the deadline. the epa also issued a final rule that makes certain stationary sources and newer modification projects subject to permitting requirements for ghg emissions, beginning in 2011, under the caa. however, in june 2014, the u.s. supreme court, in uarg v. epa, limited the application of the ghg permitting requirements under the prevention of significant deterioration and title v permitting programs to sources that would otherwise need permits based on the emission of conventional pollutants. in october 2015, the epa finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the ghg monitoring and reporting requirements. these new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. the revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities. also, in november 2016, the epa published a final rule adding monitoring methods for detecting leaks from oil and gas equipment and emission factors for leaking equipment to be used to calculate and report ghg emissions resulting from equipment leaks.
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the caa and associated state laws and regulations. in addition, the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations in the future could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any ghg emissions program. if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy.
31
moreover, some experts believe climate change poses potential physical risks, including an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events. in addition, warmer winters as a result of global warming could also decrease demand for natural gas. to the extent that such unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise, our operations may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced, including increased delays and costs. however, the uncertain nature of changes in extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration, and severity) and the long period of time over which any changes would take place make any estimations of future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change unreliable.
terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business.
the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil, all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations. acts of terrorism, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, could be directed against companies operating in the united states. the u.s. government has issued public warnings that indicate energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and, depending on their ultimate magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
cyber-attacks targeting our systems or the oil and gas industry systems and infrastructure could adversely affect our business.
our business and the oil and gas industry in general have become increasingly dependent on digital data, computer networks and connected infrastructure. we depend on this technology to record and store financial data, estimate quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves, analyze and share operating data and communicate internally and externally. computers control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution systems in the united states, which are necessary to transport our products to market.
a cyber-attack may involve a hacker, a virus, malware, phishing or other actions for the purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. unauthorized access to our proprietary information could lead to data corruption or communication or operational disruptions. a cyber-attack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage those assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for transported products.
we can provide no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks in the future. as cyber-attackers become more sophisticated, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to protect our business or remediate the damage from cyber-attacks.
certain federal income tax law changes have been proposed that, if passed, would have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
substantive changes to existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that, if adopted, would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by u.s. oil and gas companies and would impose new taxes. the proposals include: repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies; and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers. should some or all of these proposals become law, our taxes will increase, potentially significantly, which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows. this could also reduce our drilling activities in the u.s. since none of these proposals have yet to become law, we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business.
provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment.
our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock. in addition, delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties. our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders. because of these provisions of our charter, bylaws and delaware law, persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. as a result, these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors.
32
the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter.
the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors' duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission. our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law. specifically, our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability:
•   for any breach of their duty of loyalty to the company or our stockholders;
•   for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;
•   under provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; and
•   for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.
this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors, and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited our stockholders.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material.
overview financial and operating overview financial and operating results for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 are as follows:
•   equivalent production increased 24.6 bcfe, or 4%, from 602.5 bcfe, or 1,650.8 mmcfe per day, in 2015 to 627.1 bcfe, or 1,713.4 mmcfe per day, in 2016.
•   natural gas production increased 34.4 bcf, or 6%, from 566.0 bcf in 2015 to 600.4 bcf in 2016, as a result of drilling and completion activities in pennsylvania, partially offset by the divestiture of certain oil and gas properties in east texas in early 2016.
•   crude oil/condensate/ngl production decreased 1.6 mmbbls, or 27%, from 6.1 mmbbls in 2015 to 4.5 mmbbls in 2016, as a result of a decrease in drilling activities in south texas.
•   average realized natural gas price for 2016 was $1.70 per mcf, 21% lower than the $2.15 per mcf price realized in 2015.
•   average realized crude oil price for 2016 was $37.30 per bbl, 18% lower than the $45.72 per bbl price realized in 2015.
•   drilled 40 gross wells (38.0 net) with a success rate of 100.0% in 2016 compared to 138 gross wells (130.5 net) with a success rate of 100.0% in 2015.
•   completed 76 gross wells (76.0 net) in 2016 compared to 107 gross wells (98.9 net) in 2015.
•   total capital expenditures were $372.5 million in 2016 compared to $773.5 million in 2015.
•   average rig count during 2016 was approximately 1.1 rigs in the marcellus shale and approximately 0.3 rigs in the eagle ford shale, compared to an average rig count in the marcellus shale of approximately 3.5 rigs and approximately 1.9 rigs in the eagle ford shale during 2015.
•   in february 2016, we completed a public offering of our common stock and received net proceeds of $995.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.
•   in february 2016, we received proceeds of $50.1 million primarily related to the divestiture of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas.
•   in may 2016, we repurchased $64.0 million principal amount of our 6.51% weighted-average senior notes for approximately $68.3 million.
•   in december 2016, we recognized an impairment loss of $435.6 million associated with our oil and gas properties and related pipeline assets in west virginia and virginia.
market conditions and commodity prices our financial results depend on many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control, including changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials, weather conditions and other factors. in addition, our realized prices are further impacted by our hedging activities. as a result, we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and, therefore, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our capital program, production volumes or revenues. location differentials have increased in certain regions, such as in the appalachian region, resulting in further declines in natural gas prices. we expect natural gas and crude oil prices to remain volatile. in addition to production volumes and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our long-term success. for information about the impact of realized commodity prices on our natural gas and crude
38
oil and condensate revenues, refer to "results of operations" below. see "risk factors-natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business" and "risk factors-our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable" in item 1a.
we account for our derivative instruments on a mark-to-market basis with changes in fair value recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations. as a result of these mark-to-market adjustments associated with our derivative instruments, we will experience volatility in our earnings due to commodity price volatility. refer to "impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues" below and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
commodity prices have remained volatile and have improved during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 but have yet to recover to levels experienced in 2014. in the event that commodity prices significantly decline, management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties and, if necessary, record an impairment charge.
we believe we are well-positioned to manage the challenges presented in the current commodity pricing environment, and we can endure the current cyclical downturn in the oil and gas industry and the continued volatility in current and future commodity prices by:
•   continuing to exercise discipline in our capital program by fully funding our capital expenditures with operating cash flows.
•   continuing to optimize our drilling, completion and operational efficiencies, resulting in lower operating costs per unit of production.
•   continuing to manage our balance sheet, which included the issuance of common stock in february 2016. our common stock issuance allowed us to pay down the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility and certain of our senior notes, leaving us with sufficient availability under our revolving credit facility and existing cash balances to meet our capital requirements and maintain compliance with our debt covenants.
•   continuing to manage price risk by strategically hedging our natural gas and crude oil production.
financial condition capital resources and liquidity our primary sources of cash in 2016 were from funds generated from the sale of common stock, the sale of natural gas and oil production and proceeds from the sale of assets. these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital expenditures (including contributions to our equity method investments), repayment of indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and to repurchase certain of our senior notes, interest payments on debt and payment of dividends. see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow.
in february 2016, we sold an aggregate of 50.6 million shares of common stock at a price of $19.675 per share and received $995.6 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. these net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including repaying indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, repurchasing certain of our senior notes.
the borrowing base under the terms of our revolving credit facility is redetermined annually in april. in addition, either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in connection with certain acquisitions or divestitures of oil and gas properties. effective april 19, 2016, our borrowing base was reduced from $3.4 billion to $3.2 billion. the maximum credit amount under the revolving credit facility remained unchanged at $1.8 billion; however, the available commitments were reduced to $1.6 billion at the time of redetermination.
in may 2016, we repurchased $64.0 million principal amount of our 6.51% weighted-average senior notes for approximately $68.3 million. a $4.7 million extinguishment loss was recognized in the second quarter of 2016 associated with the premium paid and the write-off of a portion of the related deferred financing costs due to early repayment. as a result of the repurchase of these senior notes, the available commitments under the revolving credit facility increased to $1.7 billion and remained at that level as of december 31, 2016.
39
a decline in commodity prices could result in the future reduction of our borrowing base and related commitments under the revolving credit facility. unless commodity prices decline significantly from current levels, we do not believe that any such reductions would have a significant impact on our ability to service our debt and fund our drilling program and related operations.
we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity. our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt. we believe that, with the existing cash on hand, internally generated cash flow and availability under our revolving credit facility, we have the capacity to finance our spending plans.
as of december 31, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding and unused commitments of $1.7 billion under our revolving credit facility. at december 31, 2015, we had $413.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
at december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants for both the revolving credit facility and senior notes. see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our debt.
cash flows our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities are as follows:
year ended december 31,
(in thousands)                                                     2016   2015                    2014
cash flows provided by operating activities               $392,377                $740,737                $1,236,435
cash flows used in investing activities                   (353,218    )           (993,334    )           (1,664,840    )
cash flows provided by financing activities                458,869                 232,157                   425,959
net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents      $498,028                $(20,440    )              $(2,446    )
operating activities. operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses. prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile, primarily as a result of supply and demand for natural gas and crude oil, pipeline infrastructure constraints and seasonal influences. in addition, fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital expenditures. see "results of operations" for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues.
our working capital is substantially influenced by the variables discussed above and fluctuates based on the timing and amount of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility, the timing of cash collections and payments on our trade accounts receivable and payable, respectively, sales of our securities and changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative activity. from time to time, our working capital will reflect a deficit, while at other times it will reflect a surplus. this fluctuation is not unusual. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, we had a working capital surplus of $458.1 million and a deficit of $90.8 million, respectively. we believe we have adequate liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facility available to meet our working capital requirements over the next twelve months.
net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 decreased by $348.4 million when compared to 2015. this decrease was primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities and lower operating revenues, partially offset by lower operating expenses (excluding non-cash expenses). the decrease in operating revenues was primarily due to a decrease in realized natural gas and crude oil prices, partially offset by an increase in equivalent production. average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 21% and 18%, respectively, for 2016 compared to 2015. equivalent production increased by 4% for 2016 over 2015 as a result of higher natural gas production in the marcellus shale, partially offset by lower oil production in the eagle ford shale.
net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 decreased by $495.7 million when compared to 2014. this decrease was primarily due to lower operating revenues and higher operating expenses (excluding non-cash expenses), partially offset by favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities. the decrease in operating revenues was primarily due to a decrease in realized natural gas and crude oil prices, partially offset by an increase in equivalent production. average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 34% and 48%, respectively, for 2015 compared to 2014. equivalent production volumes increased by 13% for 2015 over 2014 as a result of higher natural gas production in the marcellus shale and higher oil production in the eagle ford shale.
40
see "results of operations" for additional information relative to commodity price, production and operating expense fluctuations. we are unable to predict future commodity prices and, as a result, cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities.
investing activities. cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $640.1 million from 2015 to 2016 due to a decrease of $580.4 million in capital expenditures, $16.3 million lower acquisition costs and $42.8 million higher proceeds from the sale of assets.
cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $671.5 million from 2014 to 2015 due to a decrease of $524.0 million in capital expenditures, $198.4 million lower acquisition costs and a $9.0 million decrease in capital contributions associated with our equity method investments. these decreases were partially offset by a $31.8 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets and $28.1 million of changes in restricted cash balances.
financing activities. cash flows provided by financing activities increased by $226.7 million from 2015 to 2016 due to $995.3 million of net proceeds related to the issuance of common stock and lower capitalized debt issuance costs of $4.6 million related to the amendment of our revolving credit facility and senior notes in december 2015. these increases were partially offset by $770.0 million of higher net repayments of debt due to the repayment of the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility and certain of our senior notes with the proceeds from the issuance of common stock and $3.1 million of higher dividend payments.
cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by $193.8 million from 2014 to 2015 due to $332.0 million of lower net borrowings and an increase in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of $2.2 million related to the amendment of our credit facility in april 2015. these decreases were partially offset by lower treasury stock repurchases of $138.9 million as no shares were repurchased in 2015 and a decrease of $1.4 million in tax benefits associated with our stock-based compensation.

during 2016 and 2015, we paid dividends of $36.2 million ($0.08 per share) and $33.1 million ($0.08 per share) on our common stock, respectively.
capital and exploration expenditures on an annual basis, we generally fund most of our capital expenditures, excluding any significant property acquisitions, with cash generated from operations and, if required, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. we budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year.

(1) exploration expenditures include $10.1 million, $3.3 million and $7.8 million of exploratory dry hole expenditures in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
in 2016, we drilled 40 gross wells (38.0 net) and completed 76 gross wells (76.0 net), of which 62 gross wells (62.0 net) were drilled but uncompleted in prior years. in 2017, we plan to drill 95 gross wells (90.0 net) and complete 95 gross wells (90.0 net), of which 51 gross wells (45.0 net) were drilled but uncompleted in prior years. our 2017 drilling program includes approximately $650.0 million in total capital expenditures. we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital expenditures accordingly.
contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations. a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2016 are set forth in the following table:

amounts related to our asset retirement obligation are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures. the total amount of our asset retirement obligation at december 31, 2016 was $133.7 million. see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
we have no off-balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations.
potential impact of our critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, which is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the related disclosures of assets and liabilities. the following accounting policies are our most critical policies requiring more significant judgments and estimates. we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. actual results could differ from those estimates.
successful efforts method of accounting we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. judgment is required to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred. exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed. development costs, including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized.
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. the process relies on interpretations and judgment of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. the extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. the process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the sec, such as natural gas and crude oil prices. additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves and can change substantially over time. periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of reservoir performance, drilling activity, commodity prices, fluctuations in operating expenses, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data or other economic factors. accordingly, reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities ultimately recovered. we cannot predict the amounts or timing of such future revisions.
our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents, independent petroleum engineers, who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate. for more information regarding reserve estimation, including historical reserve revisions, refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8.
our rate of recording depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&a) expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves, which are utilized in our unit-of-production calculation. if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record dd&a expense would increase, reducing net income. such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields. a 5% positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of $0.04 per mcfe and an increase of $0.04 per mcfe, respectively, on our dd&a rate. revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dd&a rate. it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10% in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of $0.05 per mcfe and an increase of $0.06 per mcfe, respectively, on our total dd&a rate. these estimated impacts are based on current data, and actual events could require different adjustments to our dd&a rate.
in addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards. due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process, risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis, management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future.
carrying value of oil and gas properties we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a field-by-field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. if the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future natural
43
gas and crude oil prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process, historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. in the event that commodity prices significantly decline, management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties and, if necessary, record an impairment charge. fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil.
unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience, our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives. average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights. historically, the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years. the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling. we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage, especially in exploratory areas. if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year, the amortization would increase by approximately $8.9 million or decrease by approximately $7.5 million, respectively, per year.
as these properties are developed and reserves are proved, the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion. if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful, the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made. the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program.
asset retirement obligations the majority of our asset retirement obligations (aro) relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations, pipelines, processing plants and compressors. we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred, with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs, timing of settlements, inflation rates and discount rate. in periods subsequent to initial measurement, the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the units-of-production method, while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time (accretion expense) are reflected as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. at the end of each quarterly period, these instruments are marked-to-market. the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges and the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain (loss) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations. the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that are effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheet.
our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties. such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil, basis differentials, volatility factors and interest rates, such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term, as applicable. these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness. the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for non-performance risk. we measure the non-performance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions, while our non-performance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks.
our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices, both nymex and basis differentials.
44
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. these estimates and judgments include the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that we have taken. we account for the uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position. the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect management's estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties.
we believe all of our deferred tax assets, net of any valuation allowances, will ultimately be realized, taking into consideration our forecasted future taxable income, which includes consideration of future operating conditions specifically related to commodity prices. if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision could increase in the period it is determined that it is more likely than not it will not be realized.
our effective tax rate is subject to variability as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates and/or changes in tax laws which could affect us. our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the allocation of property, payroll and revenues among states in which we operate. a small change in our estimated future tax rate could have a material effect on current period earnings.
contingency reserves a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost is estimable. the establishment of a reserve is based on an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management. in certain cases, management's judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, the interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and courts of laws, our experience and the experiences of other companies dealing with similar matters, and our decision on how we intend to respond to a particular matter. actual losses can differ from estimates for various reasons, including those noted above. we monitor known and potential legal, environmental and other contingencies and make our best estimate based on the information we have. future changes in facts and circumstances not currently foreseeable could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued.
stock-based compensation we account for stock-based compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards. under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equity-classified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liability-classified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is generally the vesting period. to calculate fair value, we use either a monte carlo or black-scholes valuation model, as determined by the specific provisions of the award. the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life, volatility and other factors. stock-based compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, "summary of significant accounting policies," for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements.
recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, "summary of significant accounting policies," for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us.
other issues and contingencies regulations. our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal, state and local authorities. see "regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production," "natural gas marketing, gathering and transportation," "federal regulation of swap transactions," "federal regulation of petroleum," "pipeline safety regulation," and "environmental and safety regulations" in the "other business matters" section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations.
45
restrictive covenants. our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments. among other requirements, our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0, a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves before income taxes plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 1.25 to 1.0, which increases back to a ratio of 1.75 to 1.0 beginning on january 1, 2018, and a leverage ratio of debt to consolidated ebitdax of 4.75 to 1.0. through and including december 31, 2016. under the terms of the respective agreements, the leverage ratio will be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.0 through and including december 31, 2017 and 3.5 to 1.0 beginning on march 31, 2018 or until we maintain a leverage ratio below 3.0 to 1.0 for two consecutive fiscal quarters on or after december 31, 2017 or we receive an investment grade rating by standard & poor's ratings services (s&p) or moody's investor service, inc. (moody's), at which time we will no longer be subject to this covenant. our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. at december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement.
operating risks and insurance coverage. our business involves a variety of operating risks. see "risk factors-we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses" in item 1a. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience, the areas in which we operate and market conditions.
commodity pricing and risk management activities. our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil. further declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically. historically, natural gas and crude oil prices have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. in particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our oil and gas properties or a violation of certain financial debt covenants. because our reserves are predominantly natural gas (approximately 97% of equivalent proved reserves), changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices.
the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices. generally, if the related commodity index declines, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. furthermore, we have experienced widening basis differentials in certain regions, such as in the appalachian region, resulting in further declines in natural gas prices. therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is determined by certain factors that are beyond our control. however, management may mitigate this price risk on a portion of our anticipated production with the use of commodity derivatives. most recently, we have used commodity derivatives such as collar, swap and basis swap arrangements to reduce the impact of sustained lower pricing on our revenue. under both arrangements, there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions.
results of operations
2016 and 2015 compared we reported a net loss for 2016 of $417.1 million, or $0.91 per share, compared to net loss for 2015 of $113.9 million, or $0.28 per share. the increase in net loss was primarily due to lower operating revenues and higher operating expenses, partially offset by a higher income tax benefit.

natural gas revenues the decrease in natural gas revenues of $2.5 million was due to lower natural gas prices, partially offset by higher production. the increase in production was a result of our drilling and completion activities in pennsylvania, partially offset by the divestiture of certain oil and gas properties in east texas in early 2016.
crude oil and condensate revenues the decrease in crude oil and condensate revenues of $97.1 million was due to lower production and crude oil prices. the decrease in production was a result of a decrease in drilling and completion activities in south texas.

total costs and expenses from operations increased by $260.1 million from 2015 to 2016. the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:
•   direct operations decreased $40.1 million largely due to improved operational efficiencies, cost reductions from service providers and suppliers in 2016 compared to 2015 and divestiture of certain oil and gas properties in east texas in february 2016.
•   transportation and gathering increased $9.0 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher marcellus shale production and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements in the marcellus shale throughout 2015.
48
•   brokered natural gas decreased $1.8 million from 2015 to 2016. see the preceding table titled "brokered natural gas" for further analysis.
•   taxes other than income decreased $13.6 million due to $7.2 million lower production taxes resulting from lower crude oil prices and production in south texas and the receipt of a production tax refund of $1.9 million in february 2016. additionally, drilling impact fees decreased $1.5 million as a result of drilling fewer wells in pennsylvania during 2016 compared to 2015 and ad valorem taxes decreased $3.8 million as a result of lower property values primarily in south texas. the remaining changes were not individually significant.
•   exploration increased $0.2 million as a result of a $6.7 million increase in exploratory dry hole expense, partially offset by lower charges related to the release of certain drilling rig contracts in south texas and $2.7 million lower geophysical and geological costs and other exploration expenses. during 2016, we recorded rig termination charges of $1.7 million, compared to $5.1 million during 2015.
•   depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $32.1 million, of which $41.2 million was due to a lower dd&amp;a rate of $0.87 per mcfe for 2016 compared to $0.93 per mcfe for 2015, partially offset by a $23.0 million increase due to higher equivalent production volumes. the lower dd&amp;a rate was primarily due to lower cost reserve additions and the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 associated with higher dd&amp;a rate fields. in addition, amortization of unproved properties decreased $16.4 million in 2016 as a result of lower lease acquisition costs and lower amortization rates.
•   impairment of oil and gas properties and other assets was $435.6 million in 2016 due to the impairment of oil and gas properties and related pipeline assets in west virginia and virginia. in 2015, we recognized an impairment of oil and gas properties of $114.9 million related to certain non-core fields in south texas, east texas and louisiana. the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2015.
•   general and administrative increased $17.8 million due to higher stock-based compensation expense of $12.3 million primarily the result of an increase in the company's stock price during 2016 compared to 2015 and $2.7 million higher professional services. the remaining changes were not individually significant.
earnings (loss) on equity method investments the decrease in equity method earnings (loss) is the result of our proportionate share of net earnings from our equity method investments in 2016 compared to 2015.
gain (loss) on sale of assets during 2016, we recognized a net aggregate loss of $1.9 million primarily due to the sale of certain of our oil and gas properties in east and south texas. during 2015, we recognized a net aggregate gain of $3.9 million primarily due to the sale of certain unproved oil and gas properties in east texas.
loss on debt extinguishment a $4.7 million extinguishment loss was recognized in the second quarter of 2016 related to the premium paid for the repurchase of a portion of our 6.51% weighted-average senior notes in may 2016 and the write-off of a portion of the associated deferred financing costs due to early repayment.
interest expense interest expense decreased $8.6 million due to a $5.5 million decrease resulting from the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility in march 2016, which remained undrawn through december 31, 2016. interest expense also decreased $3.4 million resulting from the repurchase of a portion of our 6.51% weighted-average senior notes in may 2016 and the repayment of our 7.33% weighted-average senior notes at maturity. these decreases were offset by a $0.6 million increase in commitment fees as a result of an increase in the unused portion of the commitments under our revolving credit facility.
income tax benefit income tax benefit increased $169.1 million due to a higher pretax loss, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. the effective tax rates for 2016 and 2015 were 36.8% and 39.2%, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of non-recurring discrete items recorded during 2016 compared to 2015.
49
we expect our 2017 effective income tax rate to be approximately 37.0%; however, this rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in enacted federal and/or state tax rates that occur during the year, as well as changes in the composition and location of our asset base, our employees and our customers.
2015 and 2014 compared we reported a net loss for 2015 of $113.9 million, or $0.28 per share, compared to net income for 2014 of $104.5 million, or $0.25 per share. the decrease in net income was primarily due to lower operating revenues, higher operating and interest expenses and a decrease in gain on sale of assets. these decreases were partially offset by lower impairments on oil and gas properties.

natural gas revenues the decrease in natural gas revenues of $565.6 million was due to lower natural gas prices, partially offset by higher production associated with the positive results of our marcellus shale drilling program in pennsylvania.
crude oil and condensate revenues the decrease in crude oil and condensate revenues of $65.7 million was due to lower crude oil prices, partially offset by higher production. the increase in production was a result of our oil-focused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and production associated with the south texas assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014.

total costs and expenses from operations decreased by $629.2 million from 2014 to 2015. the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:
•   direct operations decreased $4.7 million largely due to cost reductions from suppliers, improved operational efficiencies and lower workover and plugging and abandonment expenses in 2015 compared to 2014. these decreases were partially offset by higher operating costs associated with the south texas assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014.
•   transportation and gathering increased $78.3 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher marcellus shale production, higher transportation rates and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements throughout 2014.
•   brokered natural gas decreased $17.4 million from 2014 to 2015. see the preceding table titled "brokered natural gas" for further analysis.
•   taxes other than income decreased $4.2 million due to $5.9 million lower production taxes resulting from lower crude oil and condensate revenues and $0.8 million lower drilling impact fees due to a decrease in our marcellus shale drilling activities. these decreases were partially offset by $2.0 million higher ad valorem taxes due to increased activity and the assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 in south texas and $0.6 million higher franchise taxes.
•   exploration decreased $1.3 million as a result of lower exploratory dry hole costs of $4.5 million and $2.4 million lower geophysical and geological and other exploration expenses due to reduced activity. these decreases were partially offset by a $5.1 million charge related to the release of certain drilling rig contracts in south texas in the first half of 2015.
•   depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $10.5 million, of which $117.3 million was due to a lower dd&amp;a rate of $0.93 per mcfe for 2015 compared to $1.13 per mcfe for 2014, partially offset by $79.9 million due to higher equivalent production volumes. the lower dd&amp;a rate was primarily due to lower cost reserve additions associated with our marcellus shale drilling program and the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 associated with higher dd&amp;a rate fields. in addition, amortization of unproved properties increased $24.0 million as a result of ongoing evaluation of our unproved properties and the acquisition of undeveloped leaseholds in south texas in late 2014. accretion expense increased $1.8 million due to the acquisition of proved properties in south texas in late 2014 and an increase in asset retirement obligations as a result of revisions of previous estimates recorded in fourth quarter 2014.
•   impairment of oil and gas properties and other assets was $114.9 million in 2015 due to the impairment of certain non-core fields in south texas, east texas and louisiana. the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2015. in 2014, we recognized an impairment of oil and gas properties and other assets of
52
$771.0 million related to certain non-core fields, primarily in east texas. the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2014 and management's decision not to pursue activity in these non-core areas in the then current price environments.
•   general and administrative decreased $13.1 million due to lower stock-based compensation expense of $7.8 million primarily due to a decline in the company's stock price during 2015 compared to 2014 and $1.8 million lower incentive compensation expense. the remaining increase and decreases in other expenses were not individually significant.
earnings (loss) on equity method investments the increase in equity method earnings (loss) is the result of our proportionate share of net earnings from our equity method investments in 2015 compared to 2014.
gain (loss) on sale of assets during 2015, we recognized a net aggregate gain of $3.9 million primarily due to the sale of certain unproved oil and gas properties in east texas. during 2014, we recognized a net aggregate gain of $17.1 million primarily due to the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas.
interest expense interest expense increased $23.1 million due to $24.1 million of higher interest expense associated with our private placement in september 2014 of $925 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.65% and higher commitment fees on the unused portion of our revolving credit facility of $1.0 million. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $1.7 million associated with our revolving credit facility due to a decrease in weighted-average borrowings based on daily balances of approximately $347.2 million compared to approximately $410.0 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively.
income tax benefit income tax benefit increased $1.3 million due to lower pretax income, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.  the effective tax rates for 2015 and 2014 were 39.2% and (222.4)%, respectively. the overall effective tax rate for 2014 was significantly lower due to a change in our effective state income tax rates based on updated state apportionment factors in states in which we operate. the 2014 decrease in our state apportionment factors was primarily driven by a shift in the sourcing of revenues based on the location of customers to whom we ultimately sell our natural gas in the northeast united states. the 2014 decrease in effective state income tax rates significantly affected our estimated net state deferred tax liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately $87.0 million that was reflected in our provision for income taxes in 2014.

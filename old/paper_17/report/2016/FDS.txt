item 1a. risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents factset files with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. in assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec, including the company's consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto. factset's operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors. as a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of future performance.
risk factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any of factset's forward-looking statements made by or on the company's behalf include, without limitation:
factset must ensure the protection and privacy of client data many of factset's products, as well as its internal systems and processes, involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including client portfolios. factset relies on a complex network of internal controls to protect the privacy of client data. if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if factset experiences difficulties in their implementation, misappropriation of client data by an employee or an external third party could occur, which could damage the company's reputation and ultimately its business. breaches of company security measures could expose factset, its clients or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and liability for the company, as well as the loss of existing or potential clients and damage to the company's brand and reputation.
factset must continue to introduce new products and enhancements to maintain its technological position the market for factset is characterized by rapid technological change, changes in client demands and evolving industry standards which can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable. as a result, the company's future success will continue to depend upon its ability to develop new products and enhancements that address the future needs of its target markets and to respond to their changing standards and practices. factset may not be successful in developing, introducing, marketing and licensing the company's new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis, and they may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. in addition, clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or enhancements.
factset must hire and retain key qualified personnel the company's business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. competition for talent, including engineering personnel, in the industry in which the company competes is strong. if the company is less successful in its recruiting efforts, or if it is unable to retain key employees, its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. factset needs technical resources such as product development engineers to develop new products and enhance existing products. the company relies upon sales personnel to sell its products and services and maintain healthy business relationships. factset's failure to attract and retain talented employees could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.
a decline in equity and/or fixed income returns may impact the buying power of investment management clients approximately 82.6% of the company's annual subscription value is derived from its investment management clients. the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management. an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests. moreover, extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation, resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers.
uncertainty, consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking industry may cause factset to lose clients and users factset's sell-side clients that perform m&a advisory work, capital markets services and equity research, account for approximately 17.4% of its revenues. a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by the largest banks. while improvements have been observed in the current fiscal year, the global investment banking industry continues to experience uncertainty and consolidation, which directly impacts the number of prospective clients and users within the sector. a lack of available credit would impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations. a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt. uncertainty, consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect the company's financial results and future growth.
12
a dramatic shift from active to passive investing could negatively impact user count growth the predominant investment strategy today is active investing, which attempts to outperform the market. the goal of active management is to beat a particular benchmark. the majority of mutual funds are actively managed. analyzing market trends, the economy and the company-specific factor, active managers are constantly searching out information and gathering insights to help them make their investment decisions. passive management, or indexing, is an investment management approach based on investing in exactly the same securities, and in the same proportions, as an index such dow jones industrial average or the s&p 500. it is called passive because portfolio managers don't make decisions about which securities to buy and sell; the managers merely follow the same methodology of constructing a portfolio as the index uses. the main advantage of active management is the possibility that the managers will be able to outperform the index due to their superior skills. they can make informed investment decisions based on their experiences, insights, knowledge and ability to identify opportunities that can translate into superior performance. the main advantage of passive investing is that it closely matches the performance of the index. passive investing requires little decision-making by the manager. the manager tries to duplicate the chosen index, tracking it as efficiently as possible. this results in lower operating costs that are passed on to the investor in the form of lower fees. approximately 82.6% of the company's annual subscription value is derived from its investment management clients. the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management. in the past decade, passively managed index funds have seen greater investor interest, and this trend has become more dramatic in recent years. a continued lessening of investor interest in actively managed equity funds could decrease demand for factset's products and services.
competition in factset's industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share factset continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products with competitors ranging in size from smaller, highly specialized, single-product businesses to multi-billion dollar companies. while the company believes the breadth and depth of its suite of products and applications offer benefits to its clients that are a competitive advantage, its competitors may offer price incentives to attract new business. future competitive pricing pressures may result in decreased sales volumes and price reductions, resulting in lower revenues. weak economic conditions may also result in clients seeking to utilize lower-cost information that is available from alternative sources. the impact of cost-cutting pressures across the industries factset serves could lower demand for its services. in recent years, factset has seen clients intensify their focus on containing or reducing costs as a result of the more challenging market conditions. clients within the financial services industry that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on financial market data and related services. if clients elect to reduce their spending with factset, the company's results of operations could be materially adversely affected. clients may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial market data services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors, by selecting vendors with lower-cost offerings or by self-sourcing their needs for financial market data. if clients elect to consolidate their spending on financial market data services with other vendors and not factset, the company's results of operations could be adversely affected.
failure to maintain reputation factset enjoys a positive reputation in the marketplace. factset's ability to attract and retain customers is affected by external perceptions of its brand and reputation. reputational damage from negative perceptions or publicity could affect factset's ability to attract and retain clients and employees and its ability to price its products at their full value. although the company monitors developments for areas of potential risk to its reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could have a material adverse effect on factset's business and financial results.
increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for factset each year, an increasing amount of free or relatively inexpensive information becomes available, particularly through the internet, and this trend may continue. the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for factset's products. while the company believes its service offering is distinguished by such factors as customization, timeliness, accuracy, ease-of-use, completeness and other added value factors, if users choose to obtain the information they need from public or other sources, factset's business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
13
factset's international operations involve special risks in 2016, approximately 33% of factset's revenue related to operations located outside of the u.s. in addition, a significant number of its employees, 71%, are located in offices outside of the u.s. the company expects to continue its international growth, with international revenue accounting for an increased portion of total revenue in the future. the company's international operations involve risks that differ from or are in addition to those faced by its u.s. operations. these risks include difficulties in developing products, services and technology tailored to the needs of clients around the world, including in emerging markets; different employment laws and rules and related social and cultural factors; different regulatory and compliance requirements, including in the areas of privacy and data protection, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, trade sanctions, marketing and sales and other barriers to conducting business; cultural and language differences; diverse or less stable political, operating and economic environments and market fluctuations; civil disturbances or other catastrophic events that reduce business activity; limited recognition of factset's brand; differing accounting principles and standards; restrictions on or adverse tax consequences from entity management efforts; and unexpected changes in u.s. or foreign tax laws. if the company is not able to efficiently adapt to or effectively manage the business in markets outside of the u.s., its business prospects and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. in particular, political tension has been increasing in manila, the philippines, due to comments and the behavior over the last few months of rodrigo duterte, president of the philippines. increasing civil unrest in manila may make it difficult or impossible for factset to continue its operations there. although factset has tested business continuity plans in place for its operations there, an extended period of civil unrest that halts or significantly impedes operations could have a material adverse effect on the company.
exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact financial results and cash flows the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as 71% of factset's employees and 48% of its leased office space were located outside the u.s at august 31, 2016. these exposures may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on the company's financial results and cash flows. the company's primary exposures relate to expenses denominated in british pound sterling, euro, indian rupee, japanese yen and philippine peso. this exposure has increased over the past 12 months primarily as the company's international employee base has risen 17% since august 31, 2015. factset's non-u.s. dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next 12 months are estimated to be $20.0 million, while its non-u.s. dollar denominated expenses are estimated to be $213.3 million, resulting in a net foreign currency exposure of $193.3 million. although factset believes that its foreign exchange hedging policies are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances, the company's attempt to hedge against these risks may not be successful, which could cause an adverse impact on its results of operations.
volatility in the financial markets may delay the spending pattern of clients and reduce future asv growth sales cycles for factset may fluctuate and be extended in times where the financial markets are volatile. the decision to purchase the factset service often requires management-level sponsorship, which often leads factset to engage in relatively lengthy sales efforts. purchases (and incremental asv) may therefore be delayed as uncertainties in the financial markets may cause clients to remain cautious about capital and data content expenditures, particularly in uncertain economic environments. the cycle associated with the purchase of the company's service offerings typically depends upon the size of the client.
failure to identify, integrate, or realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions factset may be unable to successfully identify acquisitions or may experience integration or other risks resulting from its acquisitions, leading to an adverse effect on its financial results. as the company continues to pursue selective acquisitions to support its business and growth strategy, it seeks to be a disciplined acquirer. there can be no assurance that it will be able to identify suitable candidates for successful acquisition at acceptable prices. in addition, the company's ability to achieve the expected returns and synergies from past and future acquisitions and alliances depends in part upon its ability to effectively integrate the offerings, technology, sales, administrative functions and personnel of these businesses into factset's core business. the company cannot assure its acquired businesses will perform at the levels anticipated. in addition, past and future acquisitions may subject the company to unanticipated risks or liabilities or disrupt operations.
a prolonged or recurring outage at factset's data centers could result in reduced service and the loss of clients factset's clients rely on the company for the delivery of time-sensitive, up-to-date data. factset's business is dependent on its ability to process substantial volumes of data and transactions rapidly and efficiently on its computer-based networks and systems. the company's computer operations and those of its suppliers and clients are vulnerable to interruption by fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, internet failures, computer viruses and other events beyond the company's reasonable control. factset maintains back-up facilities for each of its major data centers to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt operations. however, a loss of the company's services may induce its clients to seek alternative data suppliers. any such losses or damages incurred by factset could have a material adverse effect on its business. although the company seeks to minimize these risks through security measures, controls and back-up data centers, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or effective.
14
the negotiation of contract terms supporting new and existing data sets or products factset aggregates third party content from more than 220 data suppliers, 115 news sources and 85 exchanges. clients have access to the data and content found within the factset databases. these databases are important to the company's operations as they provide clients with key information. factset has entered into third party content agreements with varying lengths, which in some cases can be terminated on one year's notice at predefined dates, and in other cases on shorter notice. factset seeks to maintain favorable contractual relationships with its data suppliers. the company makes every effort, when reasonable, to locate alternative sources to ensure factset is not dependent on any one third party data supplier. factset believes it is not dependent on any one third party data supplier. the failure of factset to be able to maintain these relationships or the failure of its suppliers to deliver accurate data and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business.
third parties may claim factset infringes upon their intellectual property rights factset may receive notice from others claiming that the company has infringed upon their intellectual property rights. responding to these claims may require the company to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms, enter into settlements, stop selling or redesign affected products, pay damages or satisfy indemnification commitments with the company's clients or vendors under contractual provisions of various license arrangements. if factset is required to enter into such agreements or take such actions, its operating margins may decline as a result. factset has made and expects to continue incurring expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of its strategy to manage this risk.
changes in securities laws and regulations may increase expenses or may harm demand many of factset's clients operate within a highly regulated environment. in light of the recent conditions in the u.s. financial markets and economy, the u.s. congress and federal regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. the information provided by, or resident in, the service factset provides to its clients could be deemed relevant to a regulatory investigation or other governmental or private legal proceeding involving its clients, which could result in requests for information from factset that could be expensive and time consuming. in addition, clients subject to investigations or legal proceedings may be adversely impacted, possibly leading to their liquidation, bankruptcy, receivership, reductions in assets under management, or diminished operations that would adversely affect the company's revenues.
adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm factset's operating results factset is party to lawsuits in the normal course of business. litigation can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations. moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. unfavorable resolution of lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, operating results or financial condition. for additional information regarding legal matters, see item 3, legal proceedings, contained in part i of this report.

executive overview factset is a leading provider of integrated financial information and big data analytical applications to the global investment community. we deliver insight and information to investment professionals through our analytics, service, content, and technology. by integrating comprehensive datasets and analytics across asset classes with client data, we support the workflow of both buy-side and sell-side clients. these professionals include portfolio managers, wealth managers, research and performance analysts, risk managers, sell-side equity research professionals, investment bankers and fixed income professionals. from streaming real-time data to historical information, including quotes, estimates, news and commentary, factset offers unique and third-party content through desktop, wireless, and off-platform solutions. our wide application suite offers tools and resources including company and industry analyses, full screening tools, portfolio analysis, risk profiles, alpha-testing, portfolio optimization and research management solutions. recent additions to our offering include a complete services solution focused on verifying, cleaning and loading portfolio data across asset classes, and an execution management system through our acquisition of portware. our revenues are derived from subscriptions to products and services such as workstations, analytics, enterprise data and content, research management and trade execution. investment management (buy-side) clients account for 82.6% of our annual subscription value and the remainder is derived from investment banking firms (sell-side) that perform mergers and acquisitions ("m&a") advisory work, capital markets services and equity research.
2016 year in review fiscal 2016 results continued our positive topline growth. revenue was up 12.0% while annual subscription value ("asv") increased 8.8% organically. this fiscal year marked our 38th year of operation, our 36th consecutive year of revenue growth and our 20th consecutive year of earnings growth as a public company. the pressures our clients have experienced in the past 12 months have not abated and we have dedicated ourselves to helping them navigate an uncertain environment. as of august 31, 2016, asv totaled $1.15 billion, an increase of $92.0 million over the prior year. in addition, clients and users reached new highs of 3,092 and 65,655, respectively, in fiscal 2016. we returned $431.0 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 33.5% over the prior year. this included $120.0 million relating to an accelerated share repurchase agreement ("asr agreement") which we entered into in july 2016.
20
in 2016, we sought to strengthen and expand our core business model. our strategic acquisition of portware in october 2015 has provided a new stream of revenue and growth. portware revenues have grown in double-digits since the acquisition and portware is now break-even on an earnings per share basis. additionally, we sold our market metrics business in july 2016 and recognized an after-tax gain of $81.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. the sale allowed us to sharpen our focus on our long-term growth drivers and our mission to deliver world-class insight and information through our analytics, service, content and technology.
our investment in product, coupled with the acquisition of portware, now allows us to address an increasingly greater percentage of our clients' enterprise workflow. our robust portfolio analytics solutions have been the cornerstone of our growth in the middle office. with a growing interest in passive investment instruments, such as exchange-traded funds ("etfs"), our effort to build out our etf content and analytics product suite has made significant strides in fiscal 2016. we now have 29 etfs in the marketplace based upon factset content and over 40 benchmarks. the first factset branded etf, the spdr factset innovative technology etf, launched in january 2016.
as a testament to our broadening suite of premium products and the strength of our business and service model factset was awarded "best overall provider," "best research provider" and "best analytics provider" by inside market data in may 2016,. we were also named the "best data analytics provider" by waters technology in july 2016. other recognition included "best research and analytics tool" award for our wealth management tools at the annual systems in the city awards. portware also earned "best buy-side ems" for the third time and was included on global finance's first annual list of forex leaders, "the innovators 2015 - foreign exchange."
client service / consultants a client-centric approach has always been a key foundation of our success at factset. we support our powerful information and analytical applications with a team of financial data and modeling experts. client satisfaction is a key metric by which we measure the success of our service. according to our fiscal 2016 global client satisfaction survey, 96% of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with factset's support, consistent with the prior year. the depth of our knowledge, the data behind the models and the complex mathematics behind the answers each create an opportunity for us to forge close working relationships with our user community.
our reward for investing in a consulting group comprised of several hundred individuals is client loyalty, as evidenced by an annual client retention rate of greater than 95% of asv as of august 31, 2016. our consulting teams have been trained to listen to our clients' needs and transfer this knowledge directly to the product development teams, helping us transform suggestions into new or enhanced product offerings. in fiscal 2016, factset employees made over 45,000 client consulting visits, over 182,000 consulting calls and handled over 282,000 client questions. in addition, our new support desk in manila, the philippines handled over 5,000 client emails.
educating our clients is also an important component of our service. not only do we teach our users the nuances of our software and content offerings, but factset personnel are often thought-leaders in a particular area of financial modeling in our rapidly evolving industry. as a result, clients look to factset as a trusted partner to stay on the cutting edge of financial modeling and analysis. during fiscal 2016, over 1,600 clients attended live or online factset training sessions and we saw a 7% increase in online learning registration.
our industry-leading customer care is largely due to the talent of our employee population. as of august 31, 2016, employee headcount was 8,375, up 13.8% from a year ago. excluding the acquired portware workforce and employees of the divested market metrics business, headcount increased 13.4% from a year ago. the increases were primarily in positions that differentiate us in the market - software engineering, client service and content. in order to optimize costs, we have invested in expanding our footprint and talent pool in india and the philippines, where we now have a combined workforce of over 4,800. additionally, in fiscal 2016, we opened offices in melbourne, australia and los angeles, california.
21
of our total employees, 2,407 were located in the u.s., 849 in europe and 5,119 in asia pacific. approximately 55% of our employees were involved with content collection, 24% worked in product development, software and systems engineering, another 18% conducted sales and consulting services and the remaining 3% provided administrative support. we are proud to have received the following accolades during fiscal 2016:

key metrics the following is a review of our key metrics:
as of and for the year ended august 31,

(in millions, except client and user counts)   2016                      2015                  change revenues                                                $1,127.1                    $1,006.8         12.0%

(1)   we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, which includes the cash cost for taxes and changes in working capital, less capital expenditures. the presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. we use free cash flow, a non-gaap measure, both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluation and management of the business. management believes that this financial measure and the information we provide are useful to investors because they permit investors to view our performance using the same metric that we use to gauge progress in achieving our goals. free cash flow is also an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund further investments in future growth initiatives.

(2)   asv grew 8.8% organically year over year. organic asv excludes asv from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the last 12 months and the effects of foreign currency.

annual subscription value growth annual subscription value at any given point in time represents the forward-looking revenues for the next twelve months from all subscription services currently being supplied to clients. with proper notice to us, our clients are able to add to, delete portions of, or terminate service at any time, subject to certain contractual limitations. asv totaled $1.15 billion at august 31, 2016, up 8.8% organically over the prior year. organic asv excludes asv from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the past 12 months and the effects of foreign currency.
asv from our u.s. operations was $754.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, up 8.3% organically from a year ago. international asv totaled $395.5 million, up 10.7% organically from a year ago. asv from our international operations represented 34.4% of our company-wide total, its highest level in factset history. our european organic asv achieved a growth rate of 8.7% over the last 12 months while asia pacific organic asv grew by 17.0%. we have seen notable wins in both the sovereign wealth and investment management space and growth globally, with the addition of new clients in all three segments.
overall, asv growth for our buy-side business was 9.0%, down 40 basis points from the prior year period while our sell-side business experienced 7.6% growth, down 180 basis points from the prior year period. the decrease in the buy and sell-side growth rates can be attributed to an increase in market-related cancellations.
client and user additions as of august 31, 2016, there were 65,655 professionals using factset, an increase of 3,450 users in fiscal 2016. during fiscal 2016, we added 116 net new clients, increasing the number of clients by 3.9% over the prior year. our total client count was 3,092 as of august 31, 2016. this net number reflects a reduction of 41 clients due to the sale of the market metrics business. we continue to focus on expanding our current client base as it is essential to our long-term growth strategy and encourages incremental sales growth of workstations, applications and content at our existing clients.
annual client retention as of august 31, 2016, was greater than 95% of asv and 94% when expressed as a percentage of clients, consistent with the prior year, and despite market-related cancellations which impacted our asv growth rates. our retention success, demonstrating that a majority of our clients maintain their subscriptions to factset year over year, highlights the strength of our business model. august 31, 2016, our largest individual client accounted for 2% of total subscriptions, and annual subscriptions from our ten largest clients did not surpass 15% of total client subscriptions, consistent with august 31, 2015.
22
returning value to stockholders on may 6, 2016, our board of directors approved a 13.6% increase in the regular quarterly dividend beginning with the dividend payment in june 2016 which was $0.50 per share, or $2.00 per share per annum. in fiscal 2016, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $232.3 million under the existing share repurchase program compared to 1.7 million shares for $252.8 million under the existing share repurchase program during fiscal 2015.
additionally, in july 2016, we entered into an asr agreement to repurchase $120.0 million of our common stock. we received 595,607 shares of common stock on july 5, 2016 which was approximately 80% of the total number of shares of common stock expected to be repurchased under the asr agreement. the final settlement of the asr agreement occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, with factset receiving an additional 102,916 shares of its common stock. in conjunction with the asr agreement, in may 2016, our board of directors approved a $165.0 million expansion of the existing share repurchase program. including the expansion, $197.0 million remained available for future share repurchases as of august 31, 2016. combining our dividends and share repurchases, we returned $431.0 million to stockholders during fiscal 2016.
capital expenditures capital expenditures were $47.7 million during fiscal 2016, up from $25.7 million a year ago. approximately $27.7 million, or 58%, of our capital expenditures related to the build out of office space including $15.1 million at our new york location, $3.9 million at our chicago location and $1.4 million at our corporate headquarters in norwalk. the remainder of our capital expenditures was primarily for purchases of more servers for our existing data centers, additional laptop computers and peripherals for new employees, upgrades to existing computer systems and improvements to our telecommunication equipment.

revenues fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
revenues in fiscal 2016 were $1,127.1 million, up 12.0% compared to fiscal 2015. our revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2016 were robust demand for our portfolio analytics ("pa") suite of products, including an expansion of our multi-asset class value added products, accelerated growth in our content & technology solutions ("cts"), advancement in workstation solutions and significant progress in the portware business, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency.
robust demand for analytics we saw increased demand for total portfolio risk analytics resulting in increased traction for our fixed income and multi-asset class, performance and risk offerings. in fiscal 2016, we expanded our robust offering of analytics, models, stress testing and client reporting. our portfolio services offering supports our clients in integrating, cleansing and building strong analytics on top of their data. this managed service is an example of how we have broadened our sources of revenue, while responding to client needs. clients continue to find value in our ability to serve as a single solution for their analytics, risk and publishing needs, over a variety of asset classes, which enables them to analyze securities and portfolios based on a variety of asset classes.
23
accelerated growth in content & technology solutions our cts suite of products, which provides solutions for our clients outside our terminal business, was a significant growth driver during fiscal 2016. there is an increased awareness of our cts capabilities and data solutions to power workflows for the front and middle office. clients are developing internal solutions to provide more customization and to help them target their customers and users more directly. firms are coming to factset to integrate unique content and analytics into their client portals, customer relationship management, performance systems, quant and regulatory workflows. we license in feed form, including fundamentals, estimates, transcripts and ownership, among other offerings. the cts suite includes a growing number of standardized data feeds that complement and mirror the data in the factset workstation.
advancement in workstation solutions our workstation solutions, including research management solutions ("rms"), streetaccount, wealth management and sales & trading, continued to be positive revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2016. rms, which is comprised of our internal research notes ("irn") and code red products, provides a centralized database for collecting both internal and external research, as well as fast and efficient ways to store and retrieve notes and documents over a shared drive. growth in our rms suite was driven by the ongoing regulatory demand for transparency across an increasing number of workflows. code red, which we acquired in february 2015, has been a strong local solution supplement to our hosted irn solution. in adding code red's product offering to factset's existing rms, we have been able to offer an rms for all our clients' workflows.
significant progress in portware portware, acquired in october 2015, has maintained its strong track record of growth. we acquired portware to expand our presence strategically in large global asset managers by becoming part of their trading ecosystem. since the acquisition, portware client volume has increased as have new client and broker connections. the integration of the portware group into our organization has progressed smoothly. we continue to execute on the healthy pipeline of business from the close of the acquisition and have taken advantage of cross-selling the portware solution to factset's client base.
impact of foreign currency slightly offsetting the revenue drivers disclosed above, foreign currency movements decreased revenues by $0.1 million, or less than 10 basis points, during fiscal 2016 compared to the year ago quarter. excluding revenues from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the last twelve months and the effects of foreign currency, our organic revenue growth rate for the quarter was 8.8%.
fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
revenues in fiscal 2015 were $1,006.8 million, up 9.4% compared to fiscal 2014. our revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2015 were increases in asv, clients and users, accelerated demand for our fixed income portfolio products, portfolio analytics suite of products, sales of equity attribution and multi-asset class risk models, additional purchases of our portfolio services solutions, expansion of our proprietary content, and continued growth of our rms offering.

cost of services fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
cost of services increased 20.2% to $487.4 million as compared to the same period a year ago. expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of services was 43.2% in fiscal 2016, an increase of 290 basis points from a year ago. the increase was primarily driven by higher employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and computer-related expenses.
employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 230 basis points in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. this increase was primarily due to new employees hired in the past year. over the last 12 months, we have added 604 net new employees involved with content collection and 266 net new engineering and product development employees, as we continue to focus on servicing our existing client base, expanding our content and improving our applications. the increase in employee headcount includes 123 employees added from the portware acquisition in cost of sales related roles. amortization of acquired intangible assets, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, increased 50 basis points in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the addition of $75.5 million of intangible assets related to the acquisition of portware. computer-related expenses, which include depreciation, maintenance, software and other fees, increased 40 basis points when expressed as a percentage of revenues, as we require additional computer hardware and peripherals for new employees, upgrades to existing computer systems and the development of new internal systems to support our growing infrastructure.
25
fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
cost of services increased 14.6% to $405.3 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of services was 40.3% in fiscal 2015, an increase of 190 basis points from fiscal 2014. the increase was driven by higher employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, partially offset by lower computer depreciation.
employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, increased 210 basis points during fiscal 2015 due to new classes of consultants, engineers and product developers hired in fiscal 2015, new additions at our proprietary content collection locations, the addition of 32 employees from the code red acquisition, an increase in variable compensation and annual base salary increases. in fiscal 2015, we added 344 net new employees involved with content collection, 252 net new engineering and product development employees and 124 net new consultants. in addition, of the total incremental $6.2 million expense recorded in fiscal 2015 from the vesting of performance-based equity instruments and changes in the senior leadership responsible for the company's salesforce, $2.4 million was reported within cost of services. expenses associated with the operation of the code red business increased cost of services by $3.5 million during fiscal 2015 due to compensation paid to the acquired workforce, including stock-based compensation from equity based awards granted, amortization of acquired intangible assets and computer-related expenses.
partially offsetting the growth in cost of services during fiscal 2015 was a reduction in computer depreciation expense, which decreased 20 basis points in fiscal 2015 compared fiscal 2014. this decrease was primarily due to the continued use of fully depreciated equipment and our transition to more efficient and cost-effective servers in our data centers.
selling, general and administrative fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
sg&a expenses increased 7.6% to $290.0 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $269.5 million in fiscal 2015. expressed as a percentage of revenues, sg&a expenses decreased 110 basis points to 25.7% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower employee compensation and lower occupancy costs, which include depreciation of furniture and fixtures, partially offset by expenses related to non-recurring legal matters and higher marketing costs.
employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 150 basis points from a year ago due to a higher percentage of our employee base working in a cost of services capacity compared to an sg&a role. of our total employee headcount increase in the last 12 months, only 14% were in sg&a related roles, including 43 employees from the portware acquisition. additionally, approximately 142 employees in sg&a related roles left the company as part of the sale of the market metrics business in july 2016. as such, employee compensation classified as sg&a expense declined compared to the growth in cost of services. occupancy costs, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased 20 basis points, primarily due to furniture and leasehold improvements becoming fully depreciated. the company incurred approximately $3.3 million in non-recurring expenses in fiscal 2016 related primarily to legal matters. marketing expenses increased $1.2 million year over year driven by incremental branding and advertising costs.
fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014

employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased 130 basis points due to a higher percentage of our employee base working in a cost of services capacity versus sg&a. of our total employee headcount increase in fiscal 2015, 84% was within our software engineering, content collection and product development teams, which are all included within cost of services. as such, sg&a employee compensation declined compared to the growth in cost of services. occupancy costs, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased 60 basis points, primarily due to furniture and leasehold improvements becoming fully depreciated, lower rent expense from the strengthening of the u.s. dollar and the timing of acquiring new real estate space. however, certain occupancy costs, such as rent, are temporary and are being driven by the timing of acquiring new space to support our growing employee population.

operating income and operating margin fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
operating income increased 5.4% to $349.7 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior year. our operating margin for fiscal 2016 was 31.0%, down from 33.0% a year ago. the lower operating margin was primarily due to portware's operations, which reduced our operating margin by 120 basis points in fiscal 2016. additionally, higher employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, reduced our operating margin collectively by 90 basis points. in fiscal 2016, we also incurred non-recurring charges of approximately $4.6 million related primarily to legal matters. offsetting these drivers was organic revenue growth of 9.9% and lower occupancy costs.
fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
operating income increased 9.8% to $331.9 million in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. our operating margin for fiscal 2015 was 33.0%, up from 32.8% in fiscal 2014. operating margin in fiscal 2015 was negatively impacted by a $3.2 million pre-tax charge related to changes in the senior leadership of our sales teams and a $3.0 million pre-tax charge primarily related to the vesting of performance-based equity instruments. operating income in fiscal 2014 included $3.0 million of pre-tax charges related to vesting of performance-based equity instruments and the settlement of a legal claim. excluding these charges, our fiscal 2015 adjusted operating margin was 33.6% compared to the fiscal 2014 adjusted operating margin of 33.2%. revenue growth of 9.4% and net foreign currency benefits totaling of $11.2 million aided our current year operating margin expansion.

our operating segments are aligned with how we manage the business and the demographic markets in which we serve. our internal financial reporting structure is based on three reportable segments, the u.s., europe and asia pacific. this structure helps us better manage the business and view the markets we serve. sales, consulting, data collection, product development and software engineering are the primary functional groups within each segment. each segment records compensation expense, including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of furniture and fixtures, amortization of leasehold improvements, communication costs, professional fees, rent expense, travel, marketing, office and other direct expenses. expenditures associated with our data centers, third party data costs and corporate headquarters charges are recorded by the u.s. segment and are not allocated to the other segments. the content collection centers located in india and the philippines benefit all of our segments, so the expenses incurred at these locations are allocated to each segment based on a percentage of revenues.
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
u.s. operating income decreased 4.5% to $165.3 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $173.0 million a year ago. the decrease in u.s. operating income is attributed to employee compensation growth, non-recurring charges of $4.4 million and $8.3 million of incremental amortization expense from portware, partially offset by revenue growth of 11.3%. employee compensation increased primarily due to a 7.6% increase in the u.s. employee headcount year over year. the non-recurring charges were related primarily to legal matters.
european operating income increased 13.0% to $131.4 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $116.3 million a year ago. the increase in european operating income was due to revenue growth of 10.4% and benefits from a stronger u.s. dollar. the impact of foreign currency increased european operating income by $5.1 million year over year.
asia pacific operating income increased 24.4% to $53.0 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $42.6 million a year ago. the increase in asia pacific operating income was due to revenue growth of 22.8% and benefits from a stronger u.s. dollar, partially offset by increases in employee compensation. the impact of foreign currency increased asia pacific operating income by $6.5 million year over year. employee compensation increased due to a 19.3% increase in the asia pacific employee headcount year over year.

operating income from our u.s. business advanced 4.8% to $173.0 million during fiscal 2015 compared to $165.0 million in fiscal 2014. the increase in operating income was primarily attributable to $54.1 million of incremental revenues and a decrease in computer depreciation, partially offset by a rise in employee compensation expense. u.s. revenue growth was driven by increases in the number of users and clients of factset within the u.s., a rise in sales of our pa suite of products, continued demand for our proprietary content, $5.2 million of incremental revenue from the acquisition of code red and a strong performance by our u.s. investment management sales team. excluding the acquired code red workforce, u.s. employee headcount increased 7.0% over fiscal 2014, leading to higher employee compensation costs during fiscal 2015. computer-related expenses decreased due to the transition to more efficient and cost-effective servers in our data centers in addition to the continued use of fully depreciated servers.
european operating income increased 15.2% during fiscal 2015 to $116.3 million due to revenue growth of 10.6% and the effects of favorable foreign currency fluctuations on our expense base, partially offset by increases in employee compensation, third-party data costs and occupancy expenses. the higher employee compensation costs were due to a 17.5% increase in headcount over fiscal 2014. the increase in occupancy costs, which includes rent expense, was due to an increase in leased space in london. finally, the increased third-party data costs were due to the increased number of users year over year.

the fiscal 2016 provision for income taxes was $122.2 million, up 31.8% from the same period a year ago. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the company recognized tax expense of $30.8 million related to the gain on sale of the company's market metrics business. excluding tax expense from the gain, the provision for income taxes was $91.4 million in fiscal 2016, a decrease of 1.4% from fiscal 2015, primarily due to income tax benefits from the permanent reenactment of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit in december 2015, finalizing prior year tax returns and other discrete items. overall, we recognized income tax benefits of $10.5 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $6.5 million in the same period in fiscal 2015. offsetting the tax benefits and excluding the gain on sale was an increase in taxable income of $14.8 million.
fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
the fiscal 2015 provision for income taxes was $92.7 million, up from $91.9 million in fiscal 2014. the 0.9% increase was due to a 10.0% increase in pre-tax income offset by the reenactment of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit in december 2014. the reenactment of the credit was retroactive to january 1, 2014 and extended through the end of the 2014 calendar year. the reenactment resulted in a discrete income tax benefit of $5.1 million during fiscal 2015. additionally, we recognized tax benefits of $3.7 million related to finalizing prior year tax returns and other discrete tax items.
net income and diluted earnings per share fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
net income increased 40.6% to $338.8 million and diluted earnings per share increased 43.4% to $8.19 during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. a large component of the increase in net income and diluted earnings per share during fiscal 2016 was an after-tax gain of $81.7 million related to the sale of the market metrics business. the gain increased diluted earnings per share by $2.01. excluding the after-tax gain on sale, net income increased 6.7% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, while diluted eps was $6.18. the increase year over year was primarily due to organic asv growth of 8.8% and tax benefits of $10.5 million related to the permanent reenactment of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit and finalizing prior years' tax returns and other discrete items. these increases were partially offset by incremental employee compensation expense due to the hiring of 1,015 net new employees (including 166 employees from acquisitions completed in the last 12 months). additionally, portware's operations reduced our operating margin by 120 basis points in fiscal 2016. in fiscal 2016 we also incurred non-recurring charges of approximately $3.3 million, after-tax, related primarily to legal matters. during fiscal 2016, foreign currency movements increased operating income by $11.6 million compared to a benefit of $11.2 million in the same period of fiscal 2015.
28
fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
net income increased 13.9% to $241.1 million and diluted earnings per share increased 16.1% to $5.71 during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. drivers of the increase in net income and earnings per share during fiscal 2015 included revenue growth of 9.4%, income tax benefits of $8.8 million, foreign currency benefits of $4.0 million and a decrease in diluted shares outstanding of 1.7%. these net income drivers were partially offset by incremental employee compensation expense within cost of services due to the hiring of 721 net new employees in fiscal 2015 and after-tax charges of $2.2 million and $2.1 million related to changes in the senior leadership of our sales teams and the vesting of performance-based equity instruments, respectively.

fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
cash and cash equivalents aggregated to $228.4 million, or 22.4% of our total assets at august 31, 2016, compared with $158.9 million, or 21.6% of our total assets at august 31, 2015. our cash and cash equivalents increased $69.5 million during fiscal 2016 due to cash provided by operations of $331.1 million, $153.1 million in proceeds from the sale of the company's market metrics business, $56.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $265.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt and $18.2 million in tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. these cash inflows were partially offset by $262.9 million in cash paid to acquire portware, $356.8 million in share repurchases, dividend payments of $74.2 million, capital expenditures of $47.7 million and purchases of investments, net of proceeds, of $0.9 million.
free cash flow for fiscal 2016 was $283.4 million. free cash flow generated during fiscal 2016 was attributable to $338.8 million of net income, including an after-tax gain on sale of $81.7 million, $50.6 million of positive working capital changes and $58.3 million in non-cash expenses less $47.7 million in capital expenditures. free cash flow generated in the last twelve months was up $2.6 million from the comparable year ago period due to higher levels of net income and the timing of payables and accrued compensation, offset by incremental capital expenditures.
net cash used in investing activities was $158.4 million in fiscal 2016, representing a $93.5 million increase from fiscal 2015. this increase was primarily due to our acquisition of portware in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 which resulted in a net cash outflow of $262.9 million compared to a net cash outflow of $34.8 million for acquisitions occurring in fiscal 2015. additionally, cash used in investing activities increased year over year due to an increase in capital expenditures, primarily due to the fit-out of new space in new york, chicago and the expansion of our corporate headquarters in norwalk. these cash outflows were partially offset by net proceeds of $153.1 million from the sale of our market metrics business and an increase in proceeds from the sales of investments (net of purchases) of $3.5 million year over year.
29
during fiscal 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $91.0 million compared to $187.3 million in fiscal 2015. the year over year decrease in cash used was primarily due to proceeds from long-term debt of $265.0 million, offset by an increase in cash used in share repurchases of $100.6 million, lower proceeds and tax benefits from stock options exercised of $25.4 million, and an increase in payments of regular quarterly dividends of $7.7 million. the proceeds from long-term debt related to additional borrowings under the second amendment (defined in capital needs) to our credit agreement dated february 6, 2015 (the "credit agreement") used to fund our acquisition of portware on october 16, 2015. cash used in share repurchases increased year over year as we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $232.3 million under the existing share repurchase program and 0.6 million shares for $120.0 million related to the asr agreement entered into in july 2016. we repurchased 1.7 million shares for $252.8 million in fiscal 2015 under the existing share repurchase program. dividend payments increased as our board of directors approved a 13.6% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, or $2.00 per share per annum, beginning with the dividend payment in june 2016.
we expect that for at least the next 12 months, our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of our cash. as of august 31, 2016, our total cash and cash equivalents worldwide was $228.4 million, with $300.0 million in outstanding borrowings. approximately $28.8 million of our total available cash and cash equivalents is held in bank accounts located within the u.s., $161.9 million in europe (predominantly within the uk and france) and the remaining $37.7 million is held in the asia pacific region. as of august 31, 2016, we believe our liquidity (including cash on hand, cash from operating activities and other cash flows that we expect to generate) within each geographic segment will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term operating requirements, as they occur, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend payments, stock repurchases, growth objectives and other financing activities. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
cash and cash equivalents aggregated to $158.9 million or 21.6% of our total assets at august 31, 2015, compared with $116.4 million or 17.5% of our total assets august 31, 2014. our cash and cash equivalents increased $42.5 million during fiscal 2015 due to cash provided by operations of $306.4 million, $71.5 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $35.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt and $28.9 million in tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. these cash inflows were partially offset by $34.8 million in cash paid to acquire businesses, $252.8 million in share repurchases, dividend payments of $66.6 million, capital expenditures of $25.7 million and purchases of investments, net of proceeds, of $4.4 million.
free cash flow for fiscal 2015 was $280.8 million, exceeding net income by 16%. free cash flow generated during fiscal 2015 was attributable to $241.1 million of net income, $37.6 million of positive working capital changes and $27.8 million in non-cash expenses less $25.7 million in capital expenditures. working capital improvements were derived from lower income tax payments and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of payments partially offset by a rise in accounts receivable compared to the prior year. the rise in accounts receivable was due to our year over year revenue growth. our accounts receivable balance as of august 31, 2015, rose by only 5.2% compared with august 31, 2014, while revenue growth grew by 9.4% year over year. this lesser percentage increase was primarily due to a decrease in our days sales outstanding ("dso"), which declined to 33 days as of august 31, 2015, compared to 34 days as of august 31, 2014.
net cash used in investing activities was $64.9 million during fiscal 2015, a decrease of $5.8 million over fiscal 2014 due to a $12.1 million decrease in cash used in business acquisitions and a $1.7 million increase in proceeds from sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, partially offset by a $7.9 million increase in cash used for capital expenditures.
net cash used in financing activities was $187.3 million during fiscal 2015. of this total, $252.8 million related to the repurchase of 1.7 million shares under the existing share repurchase program and $66.6 million was for the payment of regular quarterly dividends. partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds received from employee stock plans totaling $71.5 million, related tax benefits of $28.9 million and long-term debt of $35.0 million. net cash used in financing activities was $89.4 million lower in the current year due to a $36.3 million increase in proceeds from employee stock option exercises and its related income tax benefits, proceeds from long-term debt of $35.0 million and a decrease in share repurchases of $23.6 million. these positive cash movements were partially offset by an incremental $5.5 million in dividend payments due to the 12.8% increase in our regular quarterly dividend, beginning in may 2015.
capital resources capital expenditures capital expenditures were $47.7 million during fiscal 2016, up from $25.7 million a year ago. approximately $27.7 million, or 58%, of our capital expenditures related to the build out of office space including $15.1 million at our new york location, $3.9 million at our chicago location and $1.4 million at our corporate headquarters in norwalk. the remainder of our capital expenditures was primarily for purchases of more servers for our existing data centers, additional laptop computers and peripherals for new employees, upgrades to existing computer systems and improvements to our telecommunication equipment.
30
capital expenditures were $25.7 million during fiscal 2015, up from $17.7 million in fiscal 2014. approximately $13.8 million, or 54%, of our capital expenditures during fiscal 2015 were for purchase of computer equipment, including more servers for our existing data centers, purchasing laptop computers and peripherals for employees, upgrading existing computer systems and improving telecommunication equipment. the remaining 46% of our capital expenditures were used to build out our offices primarily in new york, texas and the philippines during fiscal 2015.
capital needs long-term debt on february 6, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement between factset, as the borrower, and bank of america, n.a., as the lender (the "lender"). at that date, the credit agreement provided for a $35.0 million revolving credit facility (the "revolving credit facility"), under which we could request borrowings. the credit agreement also allowed us to arrange for additional borrowings for an aggregate amount of up to $265.0 million, provided that any such request for additional borrowings was in a minimum amount of $25.0 million.
for purposes of funding our acquisition of code red on february 6, 2015, we borrowed $35.0 million in the form of a eurodollar rate loan (the "loan") under the revolving credit facility. the proceeds of the loan made under the credit agreement could be used for permitted acquisitions and general corporate purposes. on september 21, 2015, we amended the credit agreement to borrow an additional $265.0 million (the "second amendment") in order to fund our acquisition of portware, which closed on october 16, 2015. the maturity date on all outstanding loan amounts (which totaled $300.0 million as of august 31, 2016) is september 21, 2018. the second amendment also allows us, subject to certain requirements, to arrange for additional borrowings with the lender for an aggregate amount of up to $400.0 million, provided that any such request for additional borrowings must be in a minimum amount of $25.0 million. on october 26, 2016, we borrowed an additional $65.0 million for general corporate purposes.
the $300.0 million borrowed under the credit agreement bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the eurodollar rate plus 0.75% and is reported as long-term debt within the consolidated balance sheet at august 31, 2016. the eurodollar rate is defined in the credit agreement as the rate per annum equal to one-month libor. interest on the loan is payable quarterly in arrears and on the maturity date. during fiscal 2016 and 2015, we paid approximately $3.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in interest on our outstanding loan amount. the principal balance is payable in full on the maturity date.
as of august 31, 2016, we owed no commitment fees since we borrowed the full amount of the credit agreement. other fees incurred, such as legal costs to draft and review the credit agreement, totaled less than $0.1 million and were capitalized as loan origination fees. these loan origination fees are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan (three years) using the effective interest method. the credit agreement contains covenants restricting certain factset activities, which are usual and customary for this type of loan.
in addition, the credit agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio, as measured by total funded debt/ebitda, below a specified level as of the end of each fiscal quarter. we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the credit agreement as of august 31, 2016.
as of august 31, 2016, the fair value of our long-term debt was $300.0 million, which we believe approximates the carrying amount as the terms and interest rates approximate market rates given its floating interest rate basis.
letters of credit from time to time, we are required to obtain letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. approximately $1.0 million of standby letters of credit have been issued in connection with various current leased office spaces as of august 31, 2016. these standby letters of credit contain covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios. as of august 31, 2016 and 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the standby letters of credit.

foreign currency foreign currency exposure certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the european and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the u.s. dollar. the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses. translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders' equity.
as of august 31, 2016, our non-u.s. dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next 12 months were estimated to be $20.0 million while our non-u.s. dollar denominated expenses were estimated to be $213.3 million, which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of $193.3 million. our foreign currency exchange exposure is related to our operating expense base in countries outside the u.s., where 71% of our employees were located as of august 31, 2016. during fiscal 2016, foreign currency movements decreased operating income by $11.6 million, compared to $11.2 million a year ago.
foreign currency hedges as of august 31, 2016, we maintained the following foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure:
●   british pound sterling - foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 50% of our british pound sterling exposure through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.

●   indian rupee - foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 75% of our indian rupee exposure through the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

as of august 31, 2016, the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase british pound sterling with u.s. dollars was £23.1 million. the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase indian rupees with u.s. dollars was rs. 4.2 billion.
there were no other outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of august 31, 2016. a loss on derivatives of $0.5 million was recorded into operating income during fiscal 2016, compared to a loss of $0.6 million in fiscal 2015.
off-balance sheet arrangements at august 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no off-balance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships (such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities) established for purposes of facilitating off-balance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually limited purposes.
share repurchase program in fiscal 2016, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $232.3 million under the existing share repurchase program compared to 1.7 million shares for $252.8 million under the existing share repurchase program during fiscal 2015. in july 2016, we entered into an asr agreement to repurchase $120.0 million of our common stock. we received 595,607 shares of common stock on july 5, 2016, which was approximately 80% of the total number of shares of common stock expected to be repurchased under the asr agreement. the final settlement of the asr agreement occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with factset receiving an additional 102,916 shares of its common stock. in conjunction with the asr agreement, in may 2016, our board of directors approved a $165.0 million expansion of the existing share repurchase program. including the expansion, $197.0 million remained available for future share repurchases as of august 31, 2016.

contractual obligations fluctuations in our operating results, the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts, the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here.
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of august 31, 2016 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:

(1)   operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year. for more information on our operating leases, see note 19, commitments and contingencies, in the notes to the company's consolidated financial statements included in item 8.

(2)   purchase commitments represent payments due in future periods in respect of obligations to our various data vendors as well as commitments to purchase goods and services such as telecommunication and computer maintenance services.

(3)   represents the amount due under the company's loan under its revolving credit facility.

(4)   non-current income taxes payable of $8.8 million and non-current deferred tax liabilities of $1.7 million have been excluded in the table above due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future payments.

purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future. for the purpose of this tabular disclosure, purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations. expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available. the amounts paid and the timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreed-upon amounts for any of our obligations.
as disclosed earlier in the capital resources section of this md&a, we borrowed $35.0 million in the form of a eurodollar rate loan to fund the acquisition of code red in february 2015, and $265.0 million in the form of a eurodollar rate loan to fund the acquisition of portware in october 2015. the maturity date on all outstanding loan amounts is september 21, 2018, and there are no prepayment penalties in the event that we elect to prepay the loan prior to its scheduled maturity date. the amount borrowed bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the eurodollar rate plus 0.75% and is reported as long-term debt within our consolidated balance sheet at august 31, 2016.
dividends on may 6, 2016, our board of directors approved a 13.6% increase in the regular quarterly dividend beginning with the dividend payment in june 2016 which was $0.50 per share, or $2.00 per share per annum. with our dividends and our share repurchases, in the aggregate, we have returned $431.0 million to shareholders over the past 12 months. future cash dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors we considered relevant and is subject to final determination by our board of directors.

critical accounting estimates we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. in addition, there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements.

business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. all of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date. the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. our estimates are based on historical experience, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate, includes assistance from independent third party appraisal firms. our significant assumptions and estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. in addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates.
performance-based equity awards we have an employee stock-based compensation plan, which allows for the issuance of performance-based equity awards to employees. accounting guidance requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all performance-based equity awards made to employees based on the estimated fair values of the awards that are expected to vest. at the end of each reporting period, management must make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving our performance targets because the number of stock options that vest will be predicated on us achieving these levels. however, there is no current guarantee that such options will vest in whole or in part.
july 2012 performance-based option grant review in july 2012, we granted 241,546 performance-based employee stock options, which are eligible to vest in 20% tranches depending upon future streetaccount user growth through august 31, 2017. through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, four of the growth targets as outlined within the terms of the grant were achieved. as such, 80%, or 193,256, of the options granted have vested. as of august 31, 2016, the fifth tranche is expected to vest on august 31, 2017, resulting in unamortized stock-based compensation expense of $0.3 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 1.0 year. a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by streetaccount in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:
vesting percentage (in thousands)          cumulative              remaining expense catch-up adjustment*          to be recognized

fifth 20% (current expectation)     $(1,290                   )   $310
* amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of august 31, 2016.
february 2015 performance-based option grant review in connection with the acquisition of code red during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we granted 137,522 performance-based stock options. these performance-based options are eligible to vest four years from date of grant if certain code red asv and operating margin targets are achieved over the measurement period. the option holders must also remain employed by factset for the options to be eligible to vest.
34
of the total grant, 68,761 performance-based options are eligible for vesting based on achieving the growth targets over a two year measurement period ending february 28, 2017. as of august 31, 2016, total unamortized stock-based compensation of $1.3 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 2.4 years. a change, up or down, in the actual financial performance levels achieved by code red in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:
vesting percentage (in thousands)          cumulative              remaining expense catch-up adjustment*          to be recognized

the remaining 68,761 options are eligible to cliff vest based on a four-year measurement period ending february 28, 2019. as of august 31, 2016, total unamortized stock-based compensation of $0.7 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 2.4 years. a change, up or down, in the actual financial performance levels achieved by code red in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:

october 2015 and august 2016 performance-based option grant review in connection with the acquisition of portware during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we granted 530,418 performance-based stock options. these performance-based options will vest 40% on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20% on each subsequent anniversary date if certain portware revenue and operating income targets are achieved by october 16, 2017. the option holders must also remain employed by factset for the options to be eligible to vest. as of august 31, 2016, we do not believe these growth targets are probable of being achieved, and as such, no stock-based compensation expense is expected to be recognized in connection with these performance-based options. a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by portware in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:
vesting percentage (in thousands)          cumulative          remaining expense catch-up adjustment*      to be recognized

we granted 20,911 additional performance-based stock options to portware employees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. similar to the october 2015 grant, these performance-based options will vest 40% on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20% on each subsequent anniversary date if certain portware revenue and operating income targets are achieved by october 16, 2017. the option holders must also remain employed by factset for the options to be eligible to vest. as of august 31, 2016, we do not believe these growth targets are probable of being achieved, and as such, no stock-based compensation expense is expected to be recognized in connection with these performance-based options. a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by portware in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:
vesting percentage (in thousands)          cumulative          remaining expense catch-up adjustment*      to be recognized

accrued compensation we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation. approximately 15% of our total employee compensation is variable and discretionary. we conduct a final review of company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation. we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management's expectations. management takes these and other factors, including historical performance, into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates on a quarterly basis and adjusts accrual rates as appropriate. as of august 31, 2016 and 2015 the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation was $38.2 million and $38.6 million, respectively.
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized as it is estimated to have an indefinite life. at least annually, we are required to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for potential impairment, and, if impaired, write down to fair value based on the present value of discounted cash flows. our reporting units evaluated for potential impairment were the u.s., europe and asia pacific, which reflect the level of internal reporting we use to manage our business and operations. the three reporting units are consistent with the operating segments reported as there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment. the impairment test requires management to make judgments in connection with these reporting units, including assigning assets, liabilities, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit.
our impairment analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate industry and economic factors including market conditions, legal and technological factors and the profitability of our business strategies. it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategies taking into consideration present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. we have not made any material changes in our impairment analysis methodology during the past three fiscal years. while we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions. future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired, which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income and a write-down of the related asset.
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, consistent with previous years, at which time it was determined that there were no indications of impairment, with the fair value of each of the company's reporting units significantly exceeding carrying value. the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31, 2016 and 2015, was $452.9 million and $308.3 million, respectively.
our identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired content databases, client relationships, software technology, non-compete agreements and trade names resulting from acquisitions, which have been fully integrated into our operations. depending on the nature of the intangible asset, it is amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis using estimated useful lives ranging from two to twenty years. these useful lives are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. if the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. there were no adjustments to the useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization during any of the periods presented. these intangible assets have no assigned residual values as of august 31, 2016 and 2015.
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. no impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented. our ongoing consideration of the recoverability could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations. the carrying value of intangible assets as of august 31, 2016 and 2015, was $93.2 million and $40.1 million, respectively.
long-lived assets long-lived assets, comprised of property, equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computer-related assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations. when evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment if impairment indicators are present, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset's carrying value exceeds the asset's estimated fair value. if we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. using the impairment evaluation methodology described here, there have been no long-lived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years. the carrying value of long-lived assets as of august 31, 2016 and 2015, was $84.6 million and $59.3 million, respectively.
36
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
estimated tax provision and tax contingencies we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours. the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes. our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes, foreign operations, r&d and other tax credits, tax audit settlements, incentive-stock options and domestic production activities deductions. our annual effective tax rate was 26.5%, 27.8% and 30.3% in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
we recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date. otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. we will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment of cash within one year. additionally, we accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. interest is classified as income tax expense in the financial statements.
as of august 31, 2016, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling $8.8 million, including $1.3 million of accrued interest, recorded as taxes payable (non-current) within the consolidated balance sheet. unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements. when applicable, we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is effectively settled. if recognized, the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the consolidated statements of income. audits by multiple tax authorities are currently ongoing. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. for this reason, we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them. significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement. further, as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

new accounting pronouncements see note 3, summary of significant accounting policies, in the notes to the company's consolidated financial statements included in item 8 for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption, which we include here by reference.
market trends in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to financial risks involving the volatility of equity markets as well as foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
approximately 82.6% of our asv is derived from our investment management clients. the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management. an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests. moreover, extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation, resulting in lower demand for services from investment management clients. our investment banking clients that perform m&a advisory work, provide capital markets services and equity research, account for approximately 17.4% of our asv. a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by the largest banks. credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations. clients could encounter similar problems. a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in m&a funded by debt. additional uncertainty, consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth. regardless, the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities. our revenues may decline if banks, including those involved in recent merger activity, significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate m&a, capital markets and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments.
due to the global nature of our operations, we conduct business outside the u.s. in several currencies including the british pound sterling, euro, indian rupee, japanese yen and philippine peso. to the extent that our international activities increase in the future, our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase. to manage this exposure, we utilize derivative instruments (foreign currency forward contracts). by their nature, all derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk. the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposure to the counterparties associated with these instruments. our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency.
on june 23, 2016, the united kingdom ("uk") held a referendum in which british citizens approved an exit from the european union ("eu"), commonly referred to as "brexit." as a result of the referendum, the global markets and currencies have been adversely impacted, including a sharp decline in the value of the british pound sterling as compared to the u.s. dollar. volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the uk negotiates its exit from the eu. we currently hedge approximately 50% of our british pound sterling exposure through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, thus reducing our currency risk. in the longer term, any impact from brexit on us will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations. although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be, it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results. while we evaluate our own risks and uncertainty related to brexit, we will continue to partner with our clients to help them navigate the fluctuating international markets. our products, including our datasets such as georev, allow our clients to understand geographic exposure and assess the risks of operating on a global scale so they may make informed business decisions.

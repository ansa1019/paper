item 1a.  risk factors as a financial services organization, we are subject to a number of risks inherent in our transactions and present in the business decisions we make. described below are the primary risks and uncertainties that if realized could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and our access to liquidity. the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face.
our erm program incorporates risk management throughout our organization to identify, understand, and manage the risks presented by our business activities. our erm program identifies key's major risk categories as: credit risk, compliance risk, operational risk, liquidity risk, market risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, and model risk. these risk factors, and other risks we may face, are discussed in more detail in other sections of this report.
i.  credit risk should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market deteriorate, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
the strong recovery in commercial real estate, in particular the multifamily property sector, has contributed to a surge in investment and development activity. as a result, property values are elevated and oversupply is a concern in certain markets. substantial deterioration in property market fundamentals could have an impact on our portfolio, with a large portion of our clients active in real estate and specifically multifamily real estate. a correction in the real estate markets could impact the ability of borrowers to make debt service payments on loans. a portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans. typically these properties are not fully leased at loan origination; the borrower may require additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments. if property market fundamentals deteriorate sharply, the execution of new leases could slow, compromising the borrower's ability to cover the debt service payments.
we are subject to the risk of defaults by our loan counterparties and clients.
many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of counterparties and clients, including financial statements, credit reports and other information. we may also rely on representations of those counterparties, clients, or other third parties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. the inaccuracy of that information or those representations affects our ability to accurately evaluate the default risk of a counterparty or client. given the dodd-frank legislative mandate to centrally clear eligible derivative contracts, we rely on central clearing counterparties to remain open and operationally viable at all times. the possibility of a large member failure or a cybersecurity breach could result in a disruption in this market.
18
various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase.
we maintain an alll (a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense) that represents our estimate of losses based on our evaluation of risks within our existing portfolio of loans. the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan and lease loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions; and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and current trends, all of which may undergo material changes. changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, the softening of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to, such as unemployment and real estate values, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may indicate the need for an increase in the alll. bank regulatory agencies periodically review our alll and, based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management, may necessitate an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs. in addition, if charge-offs outpace the estimate in our current methodology used to establish our alll (i.e., if the loan and lease allowance is inadequate), we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the alll, which would decrease our net income and capital.
declining asset prices could adversely affect us.
during the great recession, the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets experienced reached extreme levels. this severe market disruption led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions, which caused the credit markets to constrain and also caused a widespread liquidation of assets. these asset sales, along with asset sales by other leveraged investors, including some hedge funds, rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes. asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of many of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet, and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable. although the recovery has been in place for some time, a new recession would likely reverse recent positive trends in asset prices.
we have concentrated credit exposure in commercial, financial and agricultural loans, commercial real estate loans, and commercial leases.
as of december 31, 2016, approximately 72% of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial, financial and agricultural loans, commercial real estate loans, including commercial mortgage and construction loans, and commercial leases. these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans, and have a different risk profile that includes, among other risks, a borrower's failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. the deterioration of a larger loan or a group of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans, which could result in net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses, and an increase in loan charge-offs.
ii.  compliance risk we are subject to extensive and increasing government regulation and supervision.
as a financial services institution, we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which has increased in recent years due to the implementation of the dodd-frank act and other financial reform initiatives. banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors' funds, the dif, consumers, taxpayers, and the banking system as a whole, not our debtholders or shareholders. these regulations increase our costs and affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, ability to repurchase our common shares, and growth, among other things.
keybank has faced scrutiny from our bank supervisors in the examination process and aggressive enforcement of regulations at the federal and state levels, particularly due to keybank's and keycorp's status as covered institutions under the dodd-frank act's heightened prudential standards and regulations, including its provisions designed to protect consumers from financial abuse. although many parts of the dodd-frank act are now in effect, other parts continue to be implemented, as well as other significant regulations which have been enacted with upcoming effective dates. as a result, some uncertainty remains as to the aggregate impact upon key of the dodd-frank act and other significant regulations.
changes to existing statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. these changes may subject us to additional costs and increase our litigation risk should we fail to appropriately comply. such changes may also limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, affect the investments we make, and change the manner in which we operate.
19
as a financial institution, we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. as a result of the merger with first niagara, we acquired certain lines of business that offer additional consumer products, including auto finance and insurance products. in addition, the first niagara acquisition allowed us to expand our residential mortgage business. with our increased size and expanded lines of business, we are subject to additional heightened requirements and expectations. the amount of regulation and supervision to which we are subject and our cost of compliance have increased with the additional consumer products that we now offer. we, like other companies who provide similar consumer products, face the risk of class actions and other litigation and claims arising out of these products.
additionally, federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators. this enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and affiliated parties. these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations, for practices determined to be unsafe or unsound, or for practices or acts that are determined to be unfair, deceptive, or abusive.
for more information, see "supervision and regulation" in item 1 of this report.
changes in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.
the fasb and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of key's financial statements. additionally, those bodies that establish and/or interpret the financial accounting and reporting standards (such as the fasb, sec, and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how key records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, key could be required to retroactively apply a new or revised standard, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results.
iii.  operational risk we are subject to a variety of operational risks.
in addition to the other risks discussed in this section, we are subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes, internal controls, systems, and external events. operational risk includes the risk of fraud by employees, clerical and record-keeping errors, nonperformance by vendors, threats to cybersecurity, and computer/telecommunications malfunctions. operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business, such as certain loan processing functions. for example, breakdowns or failures of our vendors' systems or employees could be a source of operational risk to us. resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation, inability to secure insurance, litigation, regulatory intervention or sanctions or foregone business opportunities.
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.
we rely heavily on communications, information systems (both internal and provided by third parties) and the internet to conduct our business. our business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal, regulatory and internal standards and specifications. in addition, a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of personal and confidential information, such as the personal information of our customers and clients. these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase mobile payments and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.
in the event of a failure, interruption, or breach of our information systems, we may be unable to avoid impact to our customers. other u.s. financial service institutions and companies have reported breaches, some severe, in the security of their websites or other systems and several financial institutions, including key, experienced significant distributed denial-of-service attacks, some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems. other potential attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, phishing, cyberattacks, and other means. to date, none of these efforts has had a material adverse effect on our business or operations. such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources,
20
including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. our security systems may not be able to protect our information systems from similar attacks due to the rapid evolution and creation of sophisticated cyberattacks. we are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information. an interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability, remediation costs, regulatory action, and reputational harm.
we rely on third parties to perform significant operational services for us.
third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf. these third parties are subject to similar risks as key relating to cybersecurity, breakdowns or failures of their own systems or employees. one or more of these third parties may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and, if any such event does occur, it may not be adequately addressed, either operationally or financially, by such third party. certain of these third parties may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations. financial or operational difficulties of a third party could also impair our operations if those difficulties interfere with such third party's ability to serve us. additionally, some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and, therefore, are subject to risks unique to the regions in which they operate. if a critical third party is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such third party are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and cost-effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. additionally, regulatory guidance adopted by federal banking regulators related to how banks select, engage and manage their third parties affects the circumstances and conditions under which we work with third parties and the cost of managing such relationships.
we are subject to claims and litigation.
from time to time, customers, vendors or other parties may make claims and take legal action against us. we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment that a loss is probable, estimable, and consistent with applicable accounting guidance. at any given time we have a variety of legal actions asserted against us in various stages of litigation. resolution of a legal action can often take years. whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor, they may result in significant financial liability and adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services.
we are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business, including, among other things, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. the number and risk of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry due to legal changes to the consumer protection laws provided for by the dodd-frank act and the creation of the cfpb.
there have also been a number of highly publicized legal claims against financial institutions involving fraud or misconduct by employees, and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur. it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, and our methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective.
we regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. we also maintain an erm program designed to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze our risks. any system of controls and any system to reduce risk exposure, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. additionally, instruments, systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance, credit, liquidity, operational and business risks and enterprise-wide risk could be less effective than anticipated. as a result, we may not be able to effectively mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk.
21
climate change, severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business.
natural disasters, including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency due to climate change, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business or upon third parties who perform operational services for us or our customers. such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in lost revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses.
iv.  liquidity risk capital and liquidity requirements imposed by the dodd-frank act require banks and bhcs to maintain more and higher quality capital and high quality liquid assets than has historically been the case.
evolving capital standards resulting from the dodd-frank act and the regulatory capital rules adopted by our regulators will have a significant impact on banks and bhcs, including key. for a detailed explanation of the new capital and liquidity rules that became effective for us on a phased-in basis on january 1, 2015, see the section titled "regulatory capital requirements" under the heading "supervision and regulation" in item 1 of this report.
the federal reserve's capital standards will require key to maintain more and higher quality capital and could limit our business activities (including lending) and our ability to expand organically or through acquisitions. they could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders. capital securities usually are the most expensive form of funding, and increasing capital levels could adversely impact key's profitability.
in addition, the new liquidity standards required us to increase our holdings of higher-quality liquid assets, may require us to change our future mix of investment alternatives, and may impact future business relationships with certain customers. additionally, support of liquidity standards may be satisfied through the use of term wholesale borrowings, which tend to have a higher cost of funds than that of traditional core deposits.
further, the federal reserve requires bhcs to obtain approval before making a "capital distribution," such as paying or increasing dividends, implementing common stock repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. the federal reserve has detailed the processes that bhcs should maintain to ensure they hold adequate capital under severely adverse conditions and have ready access to funding before engaging in any capital activities. these rules could limit key's ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares. for more information, see the section titled "regulatory capital requirements" under the heading "supervision and regulation" in item 1 of this report.
federal agencies may take actions that disrupt the stability of the u.s. financial system.
since 2008, the federal government has taken unprecedented steps to provide stability to and confidence in the financial markets. for example, the federal reserve maintains a variety of stimulus policy measures designed to maintain a low interest rate environment. in light of recent moderate improvements in the u.s. economy, federal agencies may no longer support such initiatives. the discontinuation of such initiatives may have unanticipated or unintended impacts, perhaps severe, on the financial markets. these effects could include a sudden move to higher debt yields, which could have an unfavorable effect on the quantity and cost of borrowed funds. in addition, new initiatives or legislation may not be implemented, or, if implemented, may not be adequate to counter any negative effects of discontinuing programs or, in the event of an economic downturn, to support and stabilize the economy.
we rely on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds.
we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries. with the exception of cash that we may raise from debt and equity issuances, we receive substantially all of our funding from dividends by our subsidiaries. dividends by our subsidiaries are the principal source of funds for the dividends we pay on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal payments on our debt. federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank (keycorp's largest subsidiary) can pay. for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank, see "supervision and regulation" in item 1 of this report.
in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on our common or preferred stock. such a situation could result in key losing access to alternative wholesale funding sources. in
22
addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors.
we are subject to liquidity risk, which could negatively affect our funding levels.
market conditions or other events could negatively affect our access to or the cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences.
although we maintain a liquid asset portfolio and have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet commitments under various economic conditions (including a reduced level of wholesale funding sources), a substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us. if the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in these credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time, our funding needs may require us to access funding and manage liquidity by other means. these alternatives may include generating client deposits, securitizing or selling loans, extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings, borrowing under certain secured borrowing arrangements, using relationships developed with a variety of fixed income investors, and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities. these alternative means of funding may result in an increase to the overall cost of funds and may not be available under stressed conditions, which would cause us to liquidate a portion of our liquid asset portfolio to meet any funding needs.
our credit ratings affect our liquidity position.
the rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities of keycorp and keybank, and their ratings of our long-term debt and other securities are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength, ability to generate earnings, and other factors. some of these factors are not entirely within our control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies as a result of the dodd-frank act. we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings. following key's announced acquisition of first niagara in october 2015, s&p and fitch affirmed key's ratings but changed the outlook to negative. on july 13, 2016, moody's subsequently confirmed key's ratings and changed the outlook from negative to stable, concluding their review. a rating downgrade of the securities of keycorp or keybank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us, reducing our ability to generate income.
v.  market risk a reversal of the u.s. economic recovery and a return to volatile or recessionary conditions in the u.s. or abroad could negatively affect our business or our access to capital markets.
a worsening of economic and market conditions, downside shocks, or a return to recessionary economic conditions could result in adverse effects on key and others in the financial services industry. the prolonged low-interest rate environment, despite a generally improving economy, has presented a challenge for the industry, including key, and affects business and financial performance.
in particular, we could face some of the following risks, and other unforeseeable risks, in connection with a downturn in the economic and market environment or in the face of downside shocks or a recession, whether in the united states or internationally:
•   a loss of confidence in the financial services industry and the equity markets by investors, placing pressure on the price of key's common shares or decreasing the credit or liquidity available to key;
•   a decrease in consumer and business confidence levels generally, decreasing credit usage and investment or increasing delinquencies and defaults;
•   a decrease in household or corporate incomes, reducing demand for key's products and services;
•   a decrease in the value of collateral securing loans to key's borrowers or a decrease in the quality of key's loan portfolio, increasing loan charge-offs and reducing key's net income;
•   a decrease in our ability to liquidate positions at acceptable market prices;
23
•   the extended continuation of the current low-interest rate environment, continuing or increasing downward pressure to our net interest income;
•   an increase in competition or consolidation in the financial services industry;
•   increased concern over and scrutiny of the capital and liquidity levels of financial institutions generally, and those of our transaction counterparties specifically;
•   a decrease in confidence in the creditworthiness of the united states or other governments whose securities we hold; and
•   an increase in limitations on or the regulation of financial services companies like key.
we are subject to interest rate risk, which could adversely affect net interest income.
our earnings are largely dependent upon our net interest income. net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the federal reserve. changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rate controls being applied by the federal reserve, could influence the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities, the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments, net interest income, and therefore our earnings, would be adversely affected. conversely, earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings.
our methods for simulating and analyzing our interest rate exposure are discussed more fully under the heading "risk management - management of interest risk exposure" found in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation.
our profitability depends upon economic conditions in the geographic regions where we have significant operations and on certain market segments in which we conduct significant business.
we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic regions where our bank branches are located - washington; oregon/alaska; rocky mountains; indiana/northwest ohio/michigan; central/southwest ohio; east ohio/western pennsylvania; atlantic; western new york; eastern new york; and new england - and additional exposure to geographic regions outside of our branch footprint. the moderate u.s. economic recovery in the various regions where we operate has been uneven, and continued improvement in the overall u.s. economy may not result in similar improvement, or any improvement at all, in the economy of any particular geographic region. adverse conditions in a geographic region such as inflation, unemployment, recession, natural disasters, or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of borrowers in these regions to repay their loans, decrease the value of collateral securing loans made in these regions, or affect the ability of our customers in these regions to continue conducting business with us.
additionally, a significant portion of our business activities are concentrated within the real estate and healthcare market segments. the profitability of some of these market segments depends upon the health of the overall economy, seasonality, the impact of regulation, and other factors that are beyond our control and may be beyond the control of our customers in these market segments.
an economic downturn in one or more geographic regions where we conduct our business, or any significant or prolonged impact on the profitability of one or more of the market segments with which we conduct significant business activity, could adversely affect the demand for our products and services, the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans, and the stability of our deposit funding sources.
24
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties in the financial services industries, and we routinely execute transactions with such counterparties, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. defaults by one or more financial services institutions have led to, and may cause, market-wide liquidity problems and losses. many of our transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. in addition, our credit risk may be affected when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due us.
tax reform may impact our tax liabilities, the tax liabilities of our clients, and how we do business.
following the u.s. general election, a number of new tax reform ideas have been proposed. tax reform and other changes in tax laws may cause an increase or decrease in our overall income tax liabilities.   changes in tax laws generally will impact our clients in different ways and magnitudes and could also impact how we deliver products to our clients and satisfy our community reinvestment obligations.
current tax reform proposals include reducing the statutory federal income tax rate, which generally would reduce our tax expense as well as the tax expense of our clients.  however, such a reduction would, in general, negatively impact the economic value of tax-exempt investments, including corporate-owned life insurance and municipal securities, and also impact certain tax leasing transactions.  other potential changes such as the loss of certain tax deductions and credits could have an adverse impact on our overall income tax obligation and on our clients, which could change how we conduct our business operations in the future.
vi.  reputation risk damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses.
our ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and highly-skilled management and employees is affected by our reputation. public perception of the financial services industry has declined as a result of the great recession. we face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn. significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, actual or perceived unethical behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, compliance failures, disclosure of confidential information, significant or numerous failures, interruptions or breaches of our information systems, and the activities of our clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors. actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on our reputation. we could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest. management of potential conflicts of interests is complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among our clients. the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us, which could adversely affect our businesses.
vii.  strategic risk we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives.
our ability to compete depends on a number of factors, including among others our ability to develop and successfully execute our strategic plans and initiatives. our strategic priorities include growing profitably and maintaining financial strength; effectively managing risk and reward; engaging a high-performing, talented, and diverse workforce; embracing the changes required by our clients and the marketplace; and acquiring and expanding targeted client relationships. our inability to execute on or achieve the anticipated outcomes of our strategic priorities may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability.
25
we operate in a highly competitive industry.
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of competitors, some of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us. our competitors primarily include national and super-regional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various geographic regions in which we operate. we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment management firms, investment banking firms, broker-dealers and other local, regional, national, and global financial services firms. in addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. we expect the competitive landscape of the financial services industry to become even more intense as a result of legislative, regulatory, structural, and technological changes.
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including: our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives; our ability to develop, maintain, and build long-term customer relationships based on quality service and competitive prices; our ability to develop competitive products and technologies demanded by our customers, while maintaining our high ethical standards and keeping our assets safe and sound; our ability to attract, retain, and develop a highly competent employee workforce; and industry and general economic trends. increased competition in the financial services industry, or our failure to perform in any of these areas, could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.
maintaining or increasing our market share depends upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences, while maintaining competitive prices.
the continuous, widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services and mobile devices (including smartphones and tablets), requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive. our success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products and services, as well as our distribution of them, to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences. new technologies have altered consumer behavior by allowing consumers to complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. new products allow consumers to maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits. the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as "disintermediation," could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and related income generated from those deposits.
the increasing pressure from our competitors, both bank and nonbank, to keep pace and adopt new technologies and products and services requires us to incur substantial expense. we may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products and services, modifying our existing products and services, adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits, achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval, sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base or offering products and services at prices lower than the prices offered by our competitors. these risks may affect our ability to achieve growth in our market share and could reduce both our revenue streams from certain products and services and our revenues from our net interest income.
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.
our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, retain, motivate, and develop key people. competition for the best people in most of our business activities is ongoing and can be intense, and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need to serve our customers. to attract and retain qualified employees, we must compensate these employees at market levels. typically, those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense.
various restrictions on compensation of certain executive officers were imposed under the dodd-frank act and other legislation and regulations. in addition, our incentive compensation structure is subject to review by our regulators, who may identify deficiencies in the structure of or issue additional guidance on our compensation practices, causing us to make changes that may affect our ability to offer competitive compensation to these individuals or that place us at a disadvantage to non-financial service competitors. our ability to attract and retain talented employees may be affected by these developments, or any new executive compensation limits and regulations.
acquisitions or strategic partnerships may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value.
acquiring other banks, bank branches, or other businesses involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions or partnerships, including exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired company; diversion of our management's time and attention; significant integration risk with respect to employees, accounting systems, and technology platforms;
26
increased regulatory scrutiny; and, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired company. we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions. as a result, mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities, such as the first niagara merger that we consummated on august 1, 2016, may occur at any time. acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values. therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction.
we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger with first niagara.
keycorp consummated its merger with first niagara on august 1, 2016. the success of the merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend on, among other things, our ability to combine the businesses of keycorp and first niagara in a manner that permits growth opportunities, including, among other things, enhanced revenues and revenue synergies, an expanded market reach and operating efficiencies, and that does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of keycorp or first niagara nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the surviving corporation's business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. in addition, it is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of our ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger.
we will continue to incur transaction and integration costs in connection with the first niagara merger.
we incurred and expect to continue to incur significant, nonrecurring costs in connection with consummating the first niagara merger. in addition, we will continue to incur integration costs as we integrate our business and first niagara's business, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. there can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset these transaction and integration costs over time. we may also incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees.
viii.  model risk we rely on quantitative models to manage certain accounting, risk management and capital planning functions.
we use quantitative models to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating incurred loan losses, measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, managing risk, and for capital planning purposes (including during the ccar capital planning process). our modeling methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses and correlations. these assumptions may be incorrect, particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant. additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution. even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, bad data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model's design.
as a result, our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face, may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not, or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate. if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions. furthermore, strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable, and as a result, we may realize losses or other lapses.
banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses. the failure or inadequacy of a model may result in increased regulatory scrutiny on us or may result in an enforcement action or proceeding against us by one of our regulators.

throughout the notes to consolidated financial statements and management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (the "md&a"), we use certain acronyms and abbreviations. these terms are defined in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies"), which begins on page 106.
31
introduction this section reviews the financial condition and results of operations of keycorp and its subsidiaries for each of the past three years. some tables include additional periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends in greater depth. when you read this discussion, you should also refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this report. the page locations of specific sections that we refer to are presented in the table of contents.
terminology throughout this discussion, references to "key," "we," "our," "us," and similar terms refer to the consolidated entity consisting of keycorp and its subsidiaries. "keycorp" refers solely to the parent holding company, and "keybank" refers solely to keycorp's subsidiary bank, keybank national association. keybank (consolidated) refers to the consolidated entity consisting of keybank and its subsidiaries.
we want to explain some industry-specific terms at the outset so you can better understand the discussion that follows.
•   we use the phrase continuing operations in this document to mean all of our businesses other than the education lending business, victory, and austin. the education lending business and austin have been accounted for as discontinued operations since 2009. victory was classified as a discontinued operation in our first quarter 2013 financial reporting as a result of the sale of this business as announced on february 21, 2013, and closed on july 31, 2013.
•   our exit loan portfolios are separate from our discontinued operations. these portfolios, which are in a run-off mode, stem from product lines we decided to cease because they no longer fit with our corporate strategy. these exit loan portfolios are included in other segments.
•   we engage in capital markets activities primarily through business conducted by our key corporate bank segment. these activities encompass a variety of products and services. among other things, we trade securities as a dealer, enter into derivative contracts (both to accommodate clients' financing needs and to mitigate certain risks), and conduct transactions in foreign currencies (both to accommodate clients' needs and to benefit from fluctuations in exchange rates).
•   for regulatory purposes, capital is divided into two classes. federal regulations currently prescribe that at least one-half of a bank or bhc's total risk-based capital must qualify as tier 1 capital. both total and tier 1 capital serve as bases for several measures of capital adequacy, which is an important indicator of financial stability and condition. as described under the heading "regulatory capital requirements - capital planning and stress testing" in the section entitled "supervision and regulation" in item 1 of this report, the regulators are required to conduct a supervisory capital assessment of all bhcs with assets of at least $50 billion, including keycorp. as part of this capital adequacy review, banking regulators evaluated a component of tier 1 capital, known as tier 1 common equity, using the definitions of tier 1 capital and total risk-weighted assets that were in effect in 2014, as well as a transition plan for full implementation of the regulatory capital rules. the section entitled "capital - capital adequacy" in this md&amp;a provides more information on total capital, tier 1 capital, tier 1 common equity, and the regulatory capital rules, including common equity tier 1, and describes how the three measures are calculated.
additionally, a comprehensive list of the acronyms and abbreviations used throughout this discussion is included in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies").

economic overview the u.s. economy continued its modest recovery in 2016, with preliminary overall real gdp growth of 1.6%. this was slower than the growth in 2015 of 2.6%, due to a weaker start to the year, with tepid growth of .8% in the first quarter and 1.4% in the second quarter before accelerating in the third and fourth quarters. slower growth in emerging markets, weak investment spending, and sluggish demand for american exports caused by a strong u.s. dollar, all factored in to muted economic expansion this year.
globally, the economic recovery also slowed. the european central bank extended their quantitative easing program for another year in an effort to combat deflation, while emerging markets struggled in the face of low commodity prices and a cooling chinese economy.
oil prices saw a material increase of 46.0% over the year as supply levels normalized (after plummeting to multiyear lows in 2014 and 2015). while this led to slightly higher fuel prices, it also gave much-needed support to america's struggling energy industry. the stock market also performed admirably in 2016, with the s&p 500 equity index up 9.5%, compared to a .7% decrease in 2015. much of the rally occurred late in the year, following the election, and based on expectations for growth-friendly economic policies from the u.s. presidential administration.
for 2016, 2.2 million new jobs were added in the u.s. the unemployment rate fell from 5.0% on december 31, 2015, to 4.7% on december 31, 2016. while weak labor force participation was a factor, solid job gains also drove the decline. slack appears to be leaving the labor market as reflected in rising wage growth, up 2.9% in december 2016, over last year. consumers preferred to spend rather than save in 2016 as personal consumption was up 3.8%, while the savings rate fell from 6.1% to 5.4% over this same time frame. headline inflation moved upward by 2.1% in 2016, surpassing the fed's target of 2.0%, after falling short in 2015 at .7%. core inflation was also healthy throughout the year, ending 2016 at 2.2%, compared to 2.1% at the end of 2015.
as a result of the solid economy and strengthening labor market, the housing market generally benefited in 2016. new home sales growth outpaced existing home sales, with sales of new single-family houses totaling 562,000 in 2016, up 12.2% compared to 2015. price appreciation slowed somewhat but remained positive, with the median price for existing homes up 3.8% year-over-year in december 2016, compared to 7.5% in december 2015. housing starts also posted respectable gains, up 5.7% from december 2015, supported by multi-family construction of 9.1% while single-family construction lagged slightly at 3.9%. however, a declining home ownership rate continues to weigh on sales growth. existing home sales finished 2016 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million, roughly unchanged from december 2015.
after hinting at multiple rate hikes going into 2016, the federal open market committee ("fomc") approved its first and only rate hike of the year at its december 14, 2016, meeting, raising interest rates by 25 basis points to the range of .50% - .75%. the fomc cited an improving labor market and inflation levels, which have reached the fed's 2.0% target, as the rationale behind their first rate hike since last december. the 10-year u.s. treasury yield began the year at 2.2%, and dipped to as low as 1.4% over the summer, driven by temporarily disappointing labor market data. it then recovered to 2.5% in the final weeks of 2016 as capital rotated from treasuries into equities following the election and expectations for additional fed rate hikes.
long-term financial targets our long-term financial targets are as follows:
•   generate positive operating leverage and a cash efficiency ratio of less than 60%;
•   maintain a moderate risk profile by targeting a net loan charge-offs to average loans ratio in the range of .40% to .60%; and
•   a return on tangible common equity ratio in the range of 13% to 15%.

corporate strategy we remain committed to enhancing long-term shareholder value by continuing to execute our relationship business model, growing our franchise, and being disciplined in our management of capital. our 2016-2017 strategic focus is to grow by building enduring relationships through client-focused solutions and service. we intend to pursue this strategy by growing profitably; acquiring and expanding targeted client relationships; effectively managing risk and rewards; maintaining financial strength; and engaging, retaining, and inspiring our diverse and high-performing workforce. these strategic priorities for enhancing long-term shareholder value are described in more detail below.
•   grow profitably - we will continue to focus on generating positive operating leverage by growing revenue and creating a more efficient operating environment. we expect our relationship business model to keep generating organic growth as it helps us expand engagement with existing clients and attract new customers. we will leverage our continuous improvement culture to create a more efficient cost structure that is aligned, sustainable, and consistent with the current operating environment and supports our relationship business model.
•   acquire and expand targeted client relationships - we have taken purposeful steps to enhance our ability to acquire and expand targeted relationships. our local delivery of a broad product set and industry expertise allows us to match client needs and market conditions to deliver the best solutions.
•   effectively manage risk and rewards - our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify, measure, and manage risks across the entire company to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability.
•   maintain financial strength - with the foundation of a strong balance sheet, we will remain focused on sustaining strong reserves, liquidity and capital. we will work closely with our board and regulators to manage capital to support our clients' needs and drive long-term shareholder value. our capital remains a competitive advantage for us.
•   engage a high-performing, talented, and diverse workforce - every day our employees provide our clients with great ideas, extraordinary service, and smart solutions. we will continue to engage our high-performing, talented, and diverse workforce to create an environment where they can make a difference, own their careers, be respected, and feel a sense of pride.
strategic developments we initiated the following actions during 2016 to support our corporate strategy:
•   we continue to focus on growing our businesses and remain committed to improving productivity and efficiency. excluding merger-related charges, we generated positive operating leverage, with pre-provision net revenue up 22.5% from 2015. see figure 4 entitled "gaap to non-gaap reconciliations," which presents the computations of certain financial measures excluding merger-related charges. net interest income increased $577 million from 2015, driven by the acquisition of first niagara and growth in our core earning asset balances and yields. noninterest income was driven by continued momentum in a number of our core fee-based businesses, reflecting investments we have made over the past few years, as well as the acquisition. investment banking and debt placement fees reached a record level in 2016 driven by growth in financial advisory, equity capital markets, and mortgage banking fees. although
35
noninterest expense increased from prior year, this increase primarily reflects the acquisition of first niagara as well as higher incentive and stock-based compensation.
•   our strong risk management practices and a more favorable credit environment resulted in another year of solid credit quality trends. for 2016, net loan charge-offs were .29% of average loans.
•   we completed our first niagara acquisition on august 1, 2016, the largest in our company's history. the total consideration for the transaction was approximately $4.0 billion. during the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed systems and client conversion, moving data and account information for one million new clients, converting over 300 branches, and consolidating over 100 first niagara and key branches.
•   on september 9, 2016, keycorp sold to northwest bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of northwest bancshares, inc., 18 branches in the buffalo, new york market. the branches were divested in connection with the merger between first niagara and keycorp, and pursuant to an agreement with the united states department of justice and commitments to the board of governors of the federal reserve system following a customary antitrust review in connection with the merger. the divestiture included $439 million of loans and $1.6 billion of deposits associated with the 18 branches.
•   capital management remained a priority in 2016. on june 29, 2016, the federal reserve announced that it did not object to our 2016 capital plan submitted as part of the annual ccar process. the 2016 capital plan included a common share repurchase program of up to $350 million, which is effective through the second quarter of 2017. during the third and fourth quarters of 2016, we completed $133 million of common share repurchases under the authorization.
•   the board declared a quarterly dividend of $.075 per common share for the first quarter of 2016. our 2015 capital plan proposed an increase in our quarterly common share dividend to $.085 per share, which was approved by our board in may 2016. consistent with our 2016 capital plan, we made a dividend payment of $.085 per common share for each of the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2016, which brought our annual dividend to $.33 per common share for 2016. the board will consider an additional potential increase in our quarterly common share dividend, up to $.095 per share, in the second quarter of 2017, consistent with the 2016 capital plan.
highlights of our 2016 performance financial performance for 2016, we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of $753 million, or $.80 per common share. these results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of $892 million, or $1.05 per common share, for 2015.

our 2017 expectations, as discussed below, do not include the effect of merger-related charges.
our 2016 full-year results reflect success in executing our strategy by generating positive operating leverage and maintaining strong risk management and disciplined capital management.
our taxable-equivalent net interest income for 2016 was $2.953 billion, and the net interest margin was 2.92%. these results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $2.376 billion and a net interest margin of 2.88% for the prior year reflecting the benefit from the first niagara acquisition and growth in our core earning asset balances and yields. in 2017, we expect net interest income to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion, with our outlook assuming one additional rate increase in the middle of 2017.
our noninterest income was $2.1 billion, up $191 million, or 10.2%, from 2015. growth was driven by continued momentum in a number of our core fee-based businesses, reflecting investments we have made over the past few years, including the acquisition of first niagara in the third quarter of 2016. investment banking and debt placement fees benefited from our business model and reached a record level, increasing $37 million from 2015. cards and payments income, along with corporate services income also had a record year, increasing 27.3% and 8.6%, respectively, from 2015. in 2017, we expect noninterest income to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion.
our noninterest expense was $3.8 billion, an increase of $916 million, or 32.3%, from 2015. we recognized $483 million of merger- and pension-related charges in 2016 compared to $61 million of merger-, efficiency-, and pension-related charges in 2015. excluding these charges, noninterest expense increased $494 million, or 17.8%, from 2015. personnel expense increased $421 million, driven primarily by the acquisition of first niagara. in addition, there was higher incentive and stock-based compensation, due to higher funding of both cash based plans and performance based stock awards. nonpersonnel expense increased $495 million, primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara. in 2017, we expect noninterest expense to be in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.75 billion.
average loans totaled $71.1 billion for 2016, compared to $58.6 billion in 2015. this increase reflected the impact of the first niagara acquisition and growth in commercial, financial and agricultural loans. for 2017, we anticipate average loan growth in the mid-single-digit (4% to 6%) range with 2016 adjusted to account for a full year impact of first niagara.
average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $86.4 billion for 2016, an increase of $16.2 billion compared to 2015, primarily reflecting the acquisition of first niagara and higher interest-bearing deposits resulting from core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise and growth in escrow deposits from the commercial mortgage servicing business. our consolidated loan to deposit ratio was 85.2% at december 31, 2016, compared to 87.8% at december 31, 2015. for 2017, we anticipate average deposit growth in the mid-single-digit (4% to 6%) range with 2016 adjusted to account for a full year impact of first niagara.
we maintained credit discipline in 2016, and our asset quality ratios remained strong. the provision for credit losses was $266 million for 2016 compared to $166 million for 2015. over the past 12 months, net loan charge-offs increased $63 million. this increase is attributable to the growth in our loan portfolio and higher charge-offs in our commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio over the same period. net loan charge-offs were $205 million, or .29%, of average loan balances for 2016, compared to $142 million, or .24%, for 2015. our nonperforming loans increased to $625 million, or .73%, of period-end loans at december 31, 2016, compared to $387 million, or .65%, at december 31, 2015. our alll was $858 million, or 1.00% of period-end loans, compared to $796 million, or 1.33%, at december 31, 2015, and represented 137% and 206% coverage of nonperforming loans at december 31, 2016, and december 31, 2015, respectively. in 2017, we expect net loan charge-offs to average loans to remain below our long-term targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points and for the provision to slightly exceed net loan charge-offs to provide for loan growth.
our capital ratios remain strong. our tangible common equity and tier 1 risk-based capital ratios were 8.09% and 10.89%, respectively, at december 31, 2016, compared to 9.98% and 11.35%, respectively, at december 31, 2015. in addition, our common equity tier 1 was 9.54% and 10.94%, respectively, at december 31, 2016, and december 31, 2015. we have identified four primary uses of capital:
1.   investing in our businesses, supporting our clients, and loan growth;
2.   maintaining or increasing our common share dividend;
3.   returning capital in the form of common share repurchases to our shareholders; and
37
4.   remaining disciplined and opportunistic about how we invest in our franchise to include selective acquisitions over time.
capital management remains a clear priority for us. during 2016, our full-year dividend per common share increased 14% from the prior year, and we repurchased $133 million of common shares.
figure 4 presents certain non-gaap financial measures related to "tangible common equity," "return on tangible common equity," "common equity tier 1," "tier 1 common equity," "pre-provision net revenue," "cash efficiency ratio," certain financial measures excluding merger-related charges, and "common equity tier 1 under the regulatory capital rules (estimates)."
the tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes these ratios may assist investors in analyzing key's capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bhc capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. the federal reserve focuses its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier 1 capital known as common equity tier 1. because the federal reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders' equity (essentially tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in tier 1 risk-based capital, this focus on common equity tier 1 is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories. the regulatory capital rules, described in more detail under the section "supervision and regulation" in item 1 of this report, also make common equity tier 1 a priority. the regulatory capital rules change the regulatory capital standards that apply to bhcs by, among other changes, phasing out the treatment of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities as tier 1 eligible capital. starting in 2016, our trust preferred securities are only included in tier 2 capital. since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and common equity tier 1, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. figure 4 also reconciles the gaap performance measures to the corresponding non-gaap measures.
figure 4 also shows the computation for and reconciliation of pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by gaap. we believe that eliminating the effects of the provision for credit losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.
as disclosed in note 2 ("business combination") and note 14 ("acquisition, divestiture, and discontinued operations"), keycorp completed its purchase of first niagara on august 1, 2016. the definitive agreement and plan of merger to acquire first niagara was originally announced on october 30, 2015. as a result of this transaction, we have recognized merger-related charges. figure 4 shows the computation of pre-provision net revenue excluding merger-related charges, noninterest expense excluding merger-related charges, eps excluding merger-related charges, and return on average assets from continuing operations excluding merger-related charges. we believe that eliminating the effects of the merger-related charges makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis with our prior results.
the cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-gaap performance measures. accordingly, there is no directly comparable gaap performance measure. the cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation. we also disclose the cash efficiency ratio excluding merger-related charges. we believe these ratios provide greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks. additionally, these ratios are used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis.
non-gaap financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. although these non-gaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap.

(f)   includes the deferred tax assets subject to future taxable income for realization, primarily tax credit carryforwards, as well as intangible assets (other than goodwill and mortgage servicing assets) subject to the transition provisions of the final regulatory capital rules.
(g)   the anticipated amount of regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets is based upon the federal banking agencies' regulatory capital rules (as fully phased-in on january 1, 2019); we are subject to the regulatory capital rules under the "standardized approach."
(h)   item is included in the 10%/15% exceptions bucket calculation and is risk-weighted at 250%.
(i)   includes the phase-in of deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences at 250% risk-weight. additionally, under the fully implemented regulatory capital rules, certain deferred tax assets and intangible assets subject to the transition provision are no longer required to be risk-weighted because they are deducted directly from capital.
results of operations net interest income one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. there are several factors that affect net interest income, including:
•   the volume, pricing, mix, and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;
•   the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;
•   the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;
•   interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and
•   asset quality.
to make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a "taxable-equivalent basis" (i.e., as if it were all taxable and at the same rate). for example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that - if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% - would yield $100.
figure 5 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five years. this figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable-equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years. the net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding, is calculated by dividing taxable-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.
net interest income and the net interest margin for 2016 reflect contributions from the acquisition of first niagara on august 1, 2016, $111 million of related purchase accounting accretion, and $6 million of one-time merger-related charges.
taxable-equivalent net interest income for 2016 was $2.953 billion, and the net interest margin was 2.92%, compared to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $2.376 billion and a net interest margin of 2.88% for the prior year, reflecting the benefit from the first niagara acquisition and growth in our core earning asset balances and yields.
41
taxable-equivalent net interest income for 2015 increased $59 million compared to 2014, and the net interest margin declined 9 basis points. the increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances, partially offset by lower earning asset yields, which also drove the decline in the net interest margin.
average earning assets totaled $101.3 billion for 2016, compared to $82.5 billion in 2015, reflecting the impact of the first niagara acquisition, growth in commercial, financial and agricultural loans, and higher levels of liquidity driven by deposit growth and long-term debt issuances.
the acquisition of first niagara contributed approximately $23 billion of period-end loans and $9 billion in investment securities. as part of the acquisition, we divested $439 million of loans and exited approximately $330 million of acquired non-relationship commercial loans. in addition, we completed the planned sales and repositioning of first niagara's investment portfolio to more closely align with our portfolio and investment philosophy.
the acquisition resulted in an estimated adjustment to the fair value of the acquired loan portfolio of $548 million. we anticipate finalizing the valuation of the acquired loans during the first quarter of 2017. depending on when the valuation is finalized within the first quarter, we may not be able to adjust the value of the acquired loans, if deemed necessary, until the second quarter of 2017.
average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $86.4 billion for 2016, an increase of $16.2 billion compared to 2015, primarily reflecting the acquisition of first niagara and higher interest-bearing deposits resulting from core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise and growth in escrow deposits from the commercial mortgage servicing business.
the acquisition of first niagara contributed approximately $27.3 billion of period-end deposits at september 30, 2016. this amount excludes $1.6 billion of deposits that were divested in the third quarter of 2016. the acquired deposits are spread across deposit products and consist primarily of consumer deposits.

noninterest income as shown in figure 7, noninterest income for 2016 was $2.1 billion, up $191 million, or 10.2%, from 2015. growth was driven by continued momentum in a number of our core fee-based businesses, reflecting investments we have made over the past few years, as well as the first niagara acquisition. investment banking and debt placement fees benefited from our business model and reached a record level, increasing $37 million from 2015. cards and payments income and corporate services income also had a record year, increasing 27.3% and 8.6%, respectively, from 2015.
in 2015, noninterest income increased $83 million, or 4.6%, compared to 2014. investment banking and debt placement fees increased $48 million from 2014. trust and investment services income increased $30 million, primarily due to the full year 2015 impact of the september 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities. noninterest income for 2015 also included increases of $20 million in corporate services income due to higher non-yield loan fees and dealer trading and derivatives income and $17 million in cards and payments income due to higher merchant services, purchase card, and atm debit card fees driven by increased volume. other income also increased $10 million. these increases were partially offset by declines of $27 million in net gains from principal investing and $23 million in operating lease income and other leasing gains.

the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change.
trust and investment services income trust and investment services income is one of our largest sources of noninterest income and consists of brokerage commissions, trust and asset management commissions, and insurance income. for 2016, trust and investment services income increased $31 million, or 7.2%, from the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara and higher insurance and brokerage commissions. for 2015, trust and investment services income increased $30 million, or 7.4%, from the prior year primarily due to the full year 2015 impact of the september 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities.
a significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. the assets under management that primarily generate these revenues are shown below in figure 8. at december 31, 2016, our bank, trust, and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $36.6 billion, compared to $34 billion at december 31, 2015, and $39.2 billion at december 31, 2014. as shown in figure 8, the increase from 2015 to 2016 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of first niagara. the decrease from 2014 to 2015 was primarily attributable to client attrition in the securities lending portfolio and market declines across all the portfolios.

the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change.
personnel as shown in figure 12, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, increased by $421 million, or 25.5%, in 2016 compared to 2015. the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of first niagara. in addition, there was higher incentive and stock-based compensation due to higher funding of both cash based incentive plans and performance based stock awards.
48
personnel expense increased by $61 million, or 3.8%, from 2014 to 2015. increases in incentive and stock-based compensation of $30 million, employee benefits of $26 million, and salaries of $21 million all contributed to the increase in personnel expense. these increases were partially offset by declines in technology contract labor of $10 million and severance of $6 million.

net occupancy net occupancy expense increased $50 million, or 19.6%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara. net occupancy expense decreased $6 million, or 2.3%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to lower charges related to vacating leased property and a decrease in rental expenses.
other expense other expense comprises various miscellaneous expense items such as travel and entertainment, costs associated with technology service providers, and franchise and business taxes. other expense increased $161 million, or 46.8%, in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting the impact of the first niagara acquisition, certain real estate investments, and other miscellaneous expenses. other expense increased $10 million, or 3.0%, in 2015 compared to 2014, due to fluctuations in several of other expense line items.
income taxes we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of $179 million for 2016, compared to $303 million for 2015, and $326 million for 2014. the effective tax rate, which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes, was 18.5% for 2016, compared to 24.8% for 2015, and 25.6% for 2014.
our federal tax (benefit) expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, tax credits associated with investments in low-income housing projects and energy related projects, and periodic adjustments to our tax reserves. in 2016, our effective tax rate was reduced due to lower pretax income resulting from merger-related charges, increased energy tax credits associated with leasing activities and a reduction of valuation allowances related to capital loss carryforwards. in 2015, our effective tax rate was reduced by additional federal tax credit refunds and, in 2014 due to the early termination of certain leveraged leases that resulted in nontaxable gains.
line of business results this section summarizes the financial performance of our two major business segments (operating segments): key community bank and key corporate bank. note 24 ("line of business results") describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments, provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments and certain lines of business, and explains "other segments" and "reconciling items."

key community bank summary of operations as shown in figure 14, key community bank recorded net income attributable to key of $373 million for 2016, compared to $264 million for 2015, and $249 million for 2014. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara as well as growth in key's core businesses.
taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $460 million, or 30.9%, from 2015. average loans and leases grew $6.8 billion while average deposits increased $12.7 billion compared to 2015. the positive contribution to net interest income is from loan and deposit growth related to the acquisition of first niagara and the increased value of deposits.
noninterest income increased $137 million, or 17.4% from 2015. service charges on deposit accounts income increased $38 million, or 17.8%, cards and payments income increased $35 million, or 20.8%, due to higher credit card, purchase card and atm debit card income. trust and investment services income increased $24 million, or 8.1% driven by higher insurance and brokerage commissions. corporate services income increased $10 million, or 21%. consumer mortgage income was up $5 million, or 41.7%. investment banking and debt placement fees are up $3 million, or 35.4%. other noninterest income and operating lease income increases contributed the remaining growth of $22 million.
the provision for credit losses increased $77 million, or 110%, from 2015, primarily related to the addition of the acquired credit card and consumer direct portfolios, which were acquired at a premium, increase in the alll for loans that were individually evaluated for impairment, and loan growth.
noninterest expense increased $346 million, or 19.4%, from 2015. personnel expense increased $119 million, primarily due to increases in salaries, incentive compensation, and employee benefits related to the addition of first niagara employees. nonpersonnel expense increased $227 million due to higher intangible amortization expense and fdic assessment expense.
in 2015, key community bank's net income attributable to key increased $15 million from the prior year. taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $40 million from 2014. the positive contribution to net interest income from loan and deposit growth and the increased value of deposits was partially offset by tightening credit spreads compared to one year ago. noninterest income increased $19 million from 2014. cards and payments income increased $16 million due to higher merchant services, purchase card and atm debit card income. trust and investment services income increased $5 million driven by higher insurance and brokerage commissions. investment banking and debt placement fees increased $4 million driven by higher syndication fees, and consumer mortgage was up $2 million. these increases in noninterest income were
50
partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts which were down $5 million from 2014, primarily due to reduced maintenance and overdraft fees and a $3 million decrease in other miscellaneous income. the provision for loan and lease losses increased $11 million. noninterest expense increased $24 million from 2014. personnel expense increased $16 million, primarily due to increases in salaries, incentive compensation, and stock-based compensation. nonpersonnel expense increased $8 million, primarily due to increased marketing spend and other support costs.

key corporate bank summary of operations as shown in figure 15, key corporate bank recorded net income attributable to key of $634 million for 2016, compared to $536 million for 2015 and $544 million for 2014. the 2016 increase was driven by an increase in revenue, partially offset by increases in the provision for credit losses and noninterest expense.
taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $161 million, or 18.2%, in 2016 compared to 2015. this increase is primarily due to growth in balances, with average loan and lease balances increasing $6.1 billion, or 23.5%, and average deposit balances increasing $1.7 billion, or 9.1%. the balance increases are due to the first niagara acquisition and growth in core businesses.
noninterest income increased $88 million, or 9.5%, from 2015. investment banking and debt placement fees increased $32 million driven by growth in financial advisory, equity capital markets, and mortgage banking fees. other noninterest income increased $26 million mostly driven by gains related to certain investments held by the real estate capital line of business and higher trading income. cards and payments income increased $15 million due to higher purchase and pre-paid card revenue.
the provision for credit losses increased $17 million, or 16.5%, from 2015, primarily due to higher net loan charge-offs.
noninterest expense increased $144 million, or 14.6%, from 2015. personnel expense increased $56 million due to higher salaries, incentive compensation, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense largely related to the acquisition of first niagara as well as higher performance-based compensation. nonpersonnel expense increased $88 million due to higher operating lease expense, cards and payments processing, fdic assessment, and other various expenses related to the acquisition of first niagara.
in 2015, key corporate bank's net income attributable to key decreased $8 million from the prior year. taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $45 million in 2015 compared to 2014, due to increases in both earning asset spread and deposit and borrowing spread related to higher balance levels. noninterest income increased $119 million due to increases in investment banking and debt placement fees, other noninterest income, corporate services income, and trust and investment services income. the provision for credit losses increased $89 million mostly due to increased net loan charge-offs and higher provision for unfunded commitments. noninterest expense increased $109 million mostly due to personnel expense related to the performance of the key corporate bank and the full year impact of the pacific crest securities acquisition, as well as increases in various other expense categories.

other segments other segments consist of corporate treasury, our principal investing unit, and various exit portfolios. other segments generated net income attributable to key of $83 million for 2016, compared to $125 million for 2015, and $156 million for 2014. taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased $36 million, and noninterest income declined $30 million compared to 2015, due to lower gains from principal investments.
in 2015, other segments' net income attributable to key decreased $31 million from the prior year. taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased $31 million and noninterest income decreased $48 million. these decreases in revenue were partially offset by a decline in noninterest expense of $23 million in 2015, primarily due to lower personnel expense.

commercial, financial and agricultural. our commercial, financial and agricultural loans, also referred to as "commercial and industrial," represented 46% of our total loan portfolio at december 31, 2016, and 52% at december 31, 2015, and is the largest component of our total loans. these loans are originated by both key corporate bank and key community bank and consist of fixed and variable rate loans to our large, middle market, and small business clients.

we have experienced growth in new high credit quality loan commitments and utilization with clients in our middle market segment and keybanc capital markets. our two largest industry classifications - commercial real estate and healthcare - increased by 21.8% and 12.9%, respectively, when compared to one year ago. the commercial real estate and healthcare industries represented approximately 12.0% and 8.8%, respectively, of the total commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio at december 31, 2016, and approximately 12.5% and 9.9%, respectively, at december 31, 2015. in addition, utilities and financial, which represented approximately 8.7% and 9.7%, respectively, of the commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio at december 31, 2016, increased 38.6% and 15.4%, respectively, from one year ago. the increases in our utilities and financial portfolios were due to the acquisition of first niagara.
our oil and gas loan portfolio represented $1.1 billion of outstanding commercial, financial and agricultural loans, or 1% of total loans outstanding at december 31, 2016. we have nearly 16 years of experience in energy lending with over 20 specialists dedicated to this sector, focusing on middle market companies, which is aligned with our relationship strategy.
the upstream segment, comprising oil and gas exploration and production, represents approximately 57% of our exposure, is primarily secured by oil and gas reserves, subject to a borrowing base, and is regularly stress-tested. the midstream segment, comprising mostly distribution companies, has lower exposure to commodity risk. oil field services exposure is minimal and concentrated in very few borrowers. this mix was essentially unchanged from the prior year. our total commitments in the oil and gas sector were approximately $3.2 billion at december 31, 2016.
commercial real estate loans. our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 15-state banking franchise, and keybank real estate capital, a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of commercial real estate located both within and beyond the branch system. this line of business deals primarily with nonowner-occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 69% of our average year-to-date commercial real estate loans, compared to 68% one year ago. keybank real estate capital generally focuses on larger owners and operators of commercial real estate.
commercial real estate loans totaled $17.5 billion at december 31, 2016, and $9 billion at december 31, 2015, and represented 20% and 15% of our total loan portfolio at december 31, 2016, and december 31, 2015, respectively. the increase from december 31, 2015, was due to the acquisition of first niagara. these loans, which include both owner- and nonowner-occupied properties, represented 28% and 20% of our commercial loan portfolio at december 31, 2016, and december 31, 2015, respectively. we continue to de-risk the portfolio by changing our focus from developers to owners of completed and stabilized commercial real estate.
figure 18 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both key community bank and key corporate bank. as shown in figure 18, this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral. our growth in the northeast region was primarily attributable to the acquisition of first niagara.
as presented in figure 18, at december 31, 2016, our commercial real estate portfolio included mortgage loans of $15.1 billion and construction loans of $2.3 billion, representing 18% and 3%, respectively, of our total loans. at december 31, 2016, nonowner-occupied loans represented 16% of our total loans and owner-occupied loans represented 4% of our total loans. the average size of mortgage loans originated during the fourth quarter of 2016 was $5.6 million, and our largest mortgage loan at december 31, 2016, had a balance of $74.1 million. at december 31, 2016, our average construction loan commitment was $9.4 million, our largest construction loan commitment was $65 million, and our largest construction loan amount outstanding was $32.3 million.
also shown in figure 18, 78% of our commercial real estate loans at december 31, 2016, were for nonowner-occupied properties compared to 72% at december 31, 2015. approximately 17% of these loans were construction loans at december 31, 2016, and 15% were construction loans at december 31, 2015. typically, these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. the borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. a significant decline in economic growth, and in turn rental rates and occupancy, would adversely affect our portfolio of construction loans.

commercial lease financing. we conduct commercial lease financing arrangements through our kef line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business. commercial lease financing receivables represented 8% of commercial loans at december 31, 2016, and 9% of commercial loans at december 31, 2015.
commercial loan modification and restructuring we modify and extend certain commercial loans in the normal course of business for our clients. loan modifications vary and are handled on a case-by-case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower. in many cases, borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital, collateral, guarantees, or other income sources.
modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients' financing needs. modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as tdrs. in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, a loan is classified as a tdr only when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted.
our concession types are primarily interest rate reductions, forgiveness of principal, and other modifications. loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types. because economic conditions have improved modestly and we have restructured loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower, certain of our tdr loans have returned to accrual status and consistently performed under the restructured loan terms over the past year.
57
if loan terms are extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements, our asset recovery group is consulted to help determine if any concession granted would result in designation as a tdr. transfer to our asset recovery group is considered for any commercial loan determined to be a tdr. during 2016, we had $37 million of new tdr commercial loans compared to $43 million of new tdr commercial loans in 2015.
for more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing tdrs, see note 6 ("asset quality").

we often use an a-b note structure for our tdrs, breaking the existing loan into two tranches. first, we create an a note. since the objective of this tdr note structure is to achieve a fully performing and well-rated a note, we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards. this note structure typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest, and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years. these metrics are adjusted from time to time based upon changes in long-term markets and "take-out underwriting standards" of our various lines of business. appropriately sized a notes are more likely to return to accrual status, allowing us to resume recognizing interest income. as the borrower's payment performance improves, these restructured notes typically also allow for an upgraded internal quality risk rating classification.
the b note typically is a structurally subordinate note that may or may not require any debt service until the primary payment source stabilizes and generates excess cash flow. this excess cash flow customarily is captured for application to either the a note or b note dependent upon the terms of the restructure. we evaluate the b note when we consider returning the a note to accrual status. in many cases, the b note is charged off at the same time the a note is returned to accrual status in accordance with our interpretation of accounting and regulatory guidance applicable to tdrs. alternatively, both a and b notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive.
restructured nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status based on a current, well-documented evaluation of the credit, which would include analysis of the borrower's financial condition, prospects for repayment under the modified terms, and alternate sources of repayment such as the value of loan collateral. we consider the borrower's ability to perform under the modified terms for a reasonable period (generally a minimum of six months) before returning the loan to accrual status. sustained historical repayment performance prior to the restructuring also may be taken into account. the primary consideration for returning a tdr loan to accrual status is the reasonable assurance that the full contractual principal balance of the loan and the ongoing contractually required interest payments will be fully repaid. although our policy is a guideline, considerable judgment is required to review each borrower's circumstances.
all loans processed as tdrs, including a notes and any non-charged-off b notes, are reported as tdrs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place. at december 31, 2016, we had $67 million of a note commercial tdrs. we did not have any b note commercial tdrs at december 31, 2016.
additional information regarding tdrs is provided in note 6 ("asset quality").
extensions. project loans typically are refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity, but they are often modified and extended. extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship, the status of the project, and near-term prospects for the client, the repayment source, and the collateral. in all cases, pricing and loan structure are reviewed and, where necessary, modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms that are appropriate for the risk. typical enhancements include one or more of the following: principal pay down, increased amortization, additional collateral, increased guarantees, and a cash flow sweep. some maturing loans have automatic extension options built in; in those cases, pricing and loan terms cannot be altered.
58
loan pricing is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity, the strength of the guarantor, if any, and the structure and residual risk of the transaction. therefore, pricing for an extended loan may remain the same because the loan is already priced at or above current market.
we do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business (under existing loan terms or at market rates) as tdrs, particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made. in the case of loan extensions where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made, we would analyze such credit under the applicable accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a tdr. extensions that qualify as tdrs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance.
guarantors. we conduct a detailed guarantor analysis (1) for all new extensions of credit, (2) at the time of any material modification/extension, and (3) typically annually, as part of our on-going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures. this analysis requires the guarantor entity to submit all appropriate financial statements, including balance sheets, income statements, tax returns, and real estate schedules.
while the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may vary, the high-level objectives include determining the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities, including size, quality, and nature of asset base; net worth (adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value); leverage; standing liquidity; recurring cash flow; contingent and direct debt obligations; and near-term debt maturities.
borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90-120 days of the calendar/fiscal year end. income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly. we may require certain information, such as liquidity, certifications, status of asset sales or debt resolutions, and real estate schedules, to be provided more frequently.
we routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt if the guarantor is solvent. we may not seek to enforce the guaranty if we are precluded by bankruptcy or we determine the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor's verified financial condition. we often are successful in obtaining either monetary payment or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss, cost, and the expense of collections.
mortgage and construction loans with a loan-to-value ratio greater than 1.0 are accounted for as performing loans. these loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors: (i) underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization; (ii) a satisfactory borrower payment history; and (iii) acceptable guarantor support. as of december 31, 2016, we had one mortgage loan that had a loan-to-value ratio greater than 1.0.
consumer loan portfolio consumer loans outstanding increased by $8.5 billion, or 54.6%, from one year ago, largely due to the acquisition of first niagara, partially offset by paydowns in our home equity loan portfolio.
the home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio. approximately 99% of this portfolio at december 31, 2016, was originated from our key community bank within our 15-state footprint. the remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the consumer finance line of business and is now included in other segments. home equity loans in key community bank increased by $2.4 billion, or 23%, over the past twelve months, primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara.
as shown in figure 14, we held the first lien position for approximately 57% of the key community bank home equity portfolio at december 31, 2016, and 61% at december 31, 2015. for consumer loans with real estate collateral, we track borrower performance monthly. regardless of the lien position, credit metrics are refreshed quarterly, including recent fair isaac corporation scores as well as original and updated loan-to-value ratios. this information is used in establishing the alll. our methodology is described in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") under the heading "allowance for loan and lease losses."
at december 31, 2016, 43% of our home equity portfolio was secured by second lien mortgages. on at least a quarterly basis, we continue to monitor the risk characteristics of these loans when determining whether our loss estimation methods are appropriate.
figure 20 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio by source at the end of each of the last five years, as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole.

(c)   december 31, 2012, includes $72 million of performing secured loans that were discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally re-affirmed as addressed in regulatory guidance that was updated in the third quarter of 2012. such loans have been designated as nonperforming and tdrs.
loans held for sale as shown in note 5 ("loans and loans held for sale"), our loans held for sale were $1.1 billion at december 31, 2016, compared to $639 million at december 31, 2015.
at december 31, 2016, loans held for sale included $1 billion of commercial mortgages, which increased by $490 million from december 31, 2015, $19 million of commercial, financial and agricultural loans, which decreased by $57 million from december 31, 2015, and $62 million of residential mortgage loans, which increased by $45 million from december 31, 2015. we did not have any commercial lease financing loans held for sale at december 31, 2016, a decrease of $14 million from december 31, 2015. valuations are conducted using internal models that rely on market data from sales or nonbinding bids on similar assets, including credit spreads, treasury rates, interest rate curves and risk profiles, as well as our own assumptions about the exit market for the loans and details about individual loans within the respective portfolios. we review our assumptions quarterly. for additional information related to the valuation of loans held for sale, see note 7 ("fair value measurements").
loan sales as shown in figure 21, which summarizes our loan sales for 2016 and 2015, during 2016, we sold $6.8 billion of commercial real estate loans, $354 million of commercial lease financing loans, $692 million of residential real estate loans, and $317 million of commercial loans. most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio; however, $140 million of these loan sales related to the held-to-maturity portfolio.
among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are:
•   our business strategy for particular lending areas;
•   whether particular lending businesses meet established performance standards or fit with our relationship banking strategy;
•   our a/lm needs;
•   the cost of alternative funding sources;
•   the level of credit risk;
•   capital requirements; and
•   market conditions and pricing.

in the event of default by a borrower, we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately $2.5 billion of the $224.8 billion of loans administered or serviced at december 31, 2016. additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in note 21 ("commitments, contingent liabilities, and guarantees") under the heading "recourse agreement with fnma."
we derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. we earn noninterest income (recorded as "other income") from fees for servicing or administering loans. this fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. in addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans. additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in note 10 ("mortgage servicing assets").
maturities and sensitivity of certain loans to changes in interest rates figure 23 shows the remaining maturities of certain commercial and real estate loans, and the sensitivity of those loans to changes in interest rates. at december 31, 2016, approximately 26.7% of these outstanding loans were scheduled to mature within one year.

securities our securities portfolio totaled $30.4 billion at december 31, 2016, compared to $19.1 billion at december 31, 2015. available-for-sale securities were $20.2 billion at december 31, 2016, compared to $14.2 billion at december 31, 2015. held-to-maturity securities were $10.2 billion at december 31, 2016, compared to $4.9 billion at december 31, 2015.
as shown in figure 24, all of our mortgage-backed securities, which include both securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or gnma, and are traded in liquid secondary markets. these securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the available-for-sale portfolio and at cost for the held-to-maturity portfolio. for more information about these securities, see note 7 ("fair value measurements") under the heading "qualitative disclosures of valuation techniques," and note 8 ("securities").

securities available for sale the majority of our securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of federal agency cmos and mortgage-backed securities. cmos are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. these mortgage securities generate interest income, serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements, and provide liquidity value under regulatory requirements. at december 31, 2016, we had $20.0 billion invested in cmos and other mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to $14.2 billion at december 31, 2015.
we periodically evaluate our securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established a/lm objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, the regulatory environment, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. these evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning.
in addition, the size and composition of our securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.
our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times served to provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements. these funding requirements included ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities. at other times, we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position and/or interest rate risk management strategies may require. lastly, our focus on investing in high quality liquid assets, including gnma-related securities, is related to liquidity management strategies to satisfy regulatory requirements.

other investments principal investments - investments in equity and debt instruments made by our principal investing unit - represented 25% and 46% of other investments at december 31, 2016, and december 31, 2015, respectively. they include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value. the fair value of the direct investments was $27 million at december 31, 2016, and $69 million at december 31, 2015, while the fair value of the indirect investments was $158 million at december 31, 2016, and $235 million at december 31, 2015. under the requirements of the volcker rule, we will be required to dispose of some or all of our indirect investments. the federal reserve extended the conformance period to july 21, 2017, for all banking entities with respect to covered funds. on january 13, 2017, key filed for an additional extension for illiquid funds, to retain certain indirect investments until the earlier of the date on which the investment is conformed or is expected to mature or july 21, 2022. the application for an extension was approved on february 14, 2017. as of december 31, 2016, we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments. therefore, these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology. for more information about the volcker rule, see the discussion in item 1 under the heading "other regulatory developments under the dodd-frank act - 'volcker rule'" in the section entitled "supervision and regulation."
in addition to principal investments, "other investments" include real-estate-related investments that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost. the real-estate-related investments were valued at $6 million at december 31, 2016, and $8 million at december 31, 2015. additional information pertaining to these investments are included in the "changes in level 3 fair value measurements" section of note 7 ("fair value measurements").
most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. we determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. this review may encompass such factors as the issuer's past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuer's payment history, our knowledge of the industry, third-party data, and other relevant factors. as of december 31, 2016, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $20 million, which includes $58 million of net unrealized losses. these net gains are
64
recorded as "net gains (losses) from principal investing" on the income statement. additional information regarding these investments is provided in note 7.
deposits and other sources of funds domestic deposits are our primary source of funding. the composition of our average deposits is shown in figure 5 in the section entitled "net interest income." during 2016, average domestic deposits were $86.4 billion and represented 85% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $70.1 billion and 85% during 2015. the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of first niagara, higher interest-bearing deposits resulting from core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise, and growth in escrow deposits from the commercial mortgage servicing business.
wholesale funds, consisting of deposits in our foreign office and short-term borrowings, averaged $1.3 billion during 2016, compared to $1.7 billion during 2015. the decrease from 2015 was caused by declines of $145 million in federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements and $489 million in foreign office deposits, partially offset by an increase of $280 million in bank notes and other short-term borrowings.
at december 31, 2016, we had $5.5 billion in time deposits of $100,000 or more. figure 27 shows the maturity distribution of these deposits.

capital at december 31, 2016, our shareholders' equity was $15.2 billion, up $4.5 billion from december 31, 2015. the following sections discuss certain factors that contributed to this change. for other factors that contributed to the change, see the consolidated statements of changes in equity and note 23 ("shareholders' equity").
ccar and capital actions as part of its ongoing supervisory process, the federal reserve requires bhcs like keycorp to submit an annual comprehensive capital plan and to update that plan to reflect material changes in the bhc's risk profile, business strategies, or corporate structure, including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions. in april 2016, we submitted to the federal reserve and provided to the occ our 2016 capital plan under the annual ccar process. on june 29, 2016, the federal reserve announced that it did not object to our 2016 capital plan. share repurchases of up to $350 million were included in the 2016 capital plan, which is effective through the second quarter of 2017. as previously reported, we resumed our share repurchase program under the 2016 capital plan following the close of the first niagara acquisition. we completed $133 million of common share repurchases during 2016, including repurchases to offset issuances of common shares under our employee compensation plans.
dividends as previously reported, our 2015 capital plan proposed an increase in our quarterly common share dividend from $.075 to $.085 per share, which was approved by our board in may 2016. an additional potential increase in our quarterly common share dividend, up to $.095 per share, will be considered by the board for the second quarter of the 2017, consistent with the 2016 capital plan. other changes to future dividends may be evaluated by the board based upon our earnings, financial condition, and other factors, including regulatory review. further information regarding the capital planning process and ccar is included in the "supervision and regulation" section of item 1 of this report under the heading "regulatory capital and liquidity."

consistent with the 2016 capital plan, we made a dividend payment of $.085 per share during each of the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2016, totaling $235 million, and a dividend payment of $.075 per share, or $63 million, during the first quarter of 2016.
we also made quarterly dividend payments of $1.9375 per share on our series a preferred stock during each quarter of 2016 for a total of $22 million. in the fourth quarter of 2016 we made a quarterly dividend payment of $.539063 per share on our series c preferred stock for a total of $8 million. we also made a quarterly dividend payment of $13.33 per depositary share on the depositary shares related to our series d preferred stock for a total of $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.
common shares outstanding our common shares are traded on the nyse under the symbol key with 43,291 holders of record at december 31, 2016. our book value per common share was $12.58 based on 1.08 billion shares outstanding at december 31, 2016, compared to $12.51 based on 835.8 million shares outstanding at december 31, 2015. at december 31, 2016, our tangible book value per common share was $9.99, compared to $11.22 at december 31, 2015.

at december 31, 2016, we had 177.4 million treasury shares, compared to 181.2 million treasury shares at december 31, 2015. during 2016, common shares outstanding increased by 244 million shares due to common shares issued to acquire first niagara and shares reissued under employee benefit plans, partially offset by common share repurchases under our 2016 capital plan. going forward, we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.
as discussed in further detail in the "supervision and regulation" section in item 1 of this report under the heading "capital planning and stress testing," we are required to annually submit a capital plan to the federal reserve setting forth planned capital actions, including any share repurchases our board of directors and management intend to make during the year (subject to the federal reserve's notice of non-objection). pursuant to that requirement, we will submit our 2017 capital plan to the federal reserve for review in april 2017.
capital adequacy capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. all of our capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at december 31, 2016. our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients' needs, as well as to meet the regulatory capital rules described in the "supervision and regulation" section of item 1 of this report. our shareholders' equity to assets ratio was 11.17% at december 31, 2016, compared to 11.30% at december 31, 2015. our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.09% at december 31, 2016, compared to 9.98% at december 31, 2015.
the capital modifications mandated by the regulatory capital rules, which became effective on january 1, 2015, for keycorp, require higher and better-quality capital and introduced a new capital measure, "common equity tier 1." the regulatory capital rules phased out the treatment of certain capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as eligible tier 1 capital. the phase-out period, which began january 1, 2015, for standardized approach banking organizations such as keycorp, resulted in our trust preferred securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts being treated only as tier 2 capital starting in 2016. the new minimum capital and leverage ratios under the regulatory capital rules together with the estimated ratios of keycorp at december 31, 2016, calculated on a fully phased-in basis, are set forth under the heading "basel iii" in the "supervision and regulation" section in item 1 of this report.
as of january 1, 2016, keycorp (and its banking subsidiaries) were each required to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. at december 31, 2016, our tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, and tier 1 leverage ratio were 10.89%, 12.85%, and 9.90%, respectively, compared to 11.35%, 12.97%, and 10.72%, respectively, at december 31, 2015. information regarding the regulatory capital ratios of keycorp's banking subsidiaries is presented in note 23 ("shareholders' equity").
common equity tier 1 is not formally defined by gaap and is considered to be a non-gaap financial measure. figure 4 in the "highlights of our performance" section reconciles key shareholders' equity, the gaap performance measure, to common equity tier 1, the corresponding non-gaap measure. beginning with the implementation of the regulatory capital rules, deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are deductible from common equity tier 1 on a phase-in basis. as of december 31, 2016, this balance was $4 million. as of january 1, 2016, keycorp (and its banking subsidiaries) were each required to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%. our common equity tier 1 ratio was 9.54% at december 31, 2016.

off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off-balance sheet arrangements we are party to various types of off-balance sheet arrangements, which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet.

variable interest entities a vie is a partnership, limited liability company, trust, or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria:
•   the entity does not have sufficient equity to conduct its activities without additional subordinated financial support from another party.
•   the entity's investors lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance.
•   the entity's equity at risk holders do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual returns.
•   the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their economic interests in the entity, and substantially all of the entity's activities involve, or are conducted on behalf of, investors with disproportionately few voting rights.
in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations, we consolidate a vie if we have: (i) a variable interest in the entity; (ii) the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance; and (iii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie (i.e., we are considered to be the primary beneficiary). additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") under the heading "basis of presentation," and in note 12 ("variable interest entities").
we use the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies if we have significant influence over the entity's operating and financing decisions (usually defined as a voting or economic interest of 20% to 50%, but not controlling). unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than 20% generally are carried at cost. investments held by our registered broker-dealer and investment company subsidiaries (primarily principal investments) are carried at fair value.
commitments to extend credit or funding loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria. these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments. since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized, the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay. further information about our loan commitments at december 31, 2016, is presented in note 21 ("commitments, contingent liabilities, and guarantees") under the heading "commitments to extend credit or funding." figure 31 shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding. for loan commitments and commercial letters of credit, this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss on the unused commitment if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and subsequently default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan.
other off-balance sheet arrangements other off-balance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, and other relationships, such as liquidity support provided to asset-backed commercial paper conduits, indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees. information about such arrangements is provided in note 21 under the heading "other off-balance sheet risk."
contractual obligations figure 31 summarizes our significant contractual obligations, and lending-related and other off-balance sheet commitments at december 31, 2016, by the specific time periods in which related payments are due or commitments expire.

guarantees we are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties. as guarantor, we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate, foreign exchange rate or other variable (including the occurrence or nonoccurence of a specified event). these variables, known as underlyings, may be related to an asset or liability, or another entity's failure to perform under a contract. additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in note 21 under the heading "guarantees."
risk management overview like all financial services companies, we engage in business activities and assume the related risks. the most significant risks we face are credit, compliance, operational, liquidity, market, reputation, strategic, and model risks. our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify, measure, and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section.
the board serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that key's risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders. the board understands key's risk philosophy, approves the risk appetite, inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares the actual risks to the risk appetite, and is apprised of significant risks, both actual and emerging, and determines whether management is responding appropriately. the board challenges management and ensures accountability.

the board's audit committee assists the board in oversight of financial statement integrity, regulatory and legal requirements, independent auditors' qualifications and independence, and the performance of the internal audit function and independent auditors. the audit committee meets with management and approves significant policies relating to the risk areas overseen by the audit committee. the audit committee has responsibility over all risk review functions, including internal audit, as well as financial reporting, legal matters, and fraud risk. the audit committee also receives reports on enterprise risk. in addition to regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the audit committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases.
the board's risk committee assists the board in oversight of strategies, policies, procedures, and practices relating to the assessment and management of enterprise-wide risk, including credit, market, liquidity, model, operational, compliance, reputation, and strategic risks. the risk committee also assists the board in overseeing risks related to capital adequacy, capital planning, and capital actions. the risk committee reviews and provides oversight of management's activities related to the enterprise-wide risk management framework, which includes review of the erm policy, including the risk appetite statement, and management and erm reports. the risk committee also approves any material changes to the charter of the erm committee and significant policies relating to risk management.
the audit and risk committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committee's responsibilities. committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. all members of the board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.
our erm committee, chaired by the chief executive officer and comprising other senior level executives, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. the erm program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework, and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. the erm committee reports to the board's risk committee. annually, the board reviews and approves the erm policy, as well as the risk appetite, including corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. we use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage risks. this framework is approved and managed by the erm committee.
tier 2 risk governance committees support the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends, escalating emerging risks, and discussing forward-looking assessments. risk governance committees include attendees from each of the three lines of defense. the first line of defense is the line of business primarily responsible to accept, own, proactively identify, monitor, and manage risk. the second line of defense comprises risk management representatives who provide independent, centralized oversight over all risk categories by aggregating, analyzing, and reporting risk information. risk review, our internal audit function, provides the third line of defense in their role to provide independent assessment and testing of the effectiveness, appropriateness, and adherence to keycorp's risk management policies, practices, and controls.
the chief risk officer ensures that relevant risk information is properly integrated into strategic and business decisions, ensures appropriate ownership of risks, provides input into performance and compensation decisions, assesses aggregate enterprise risk, monitors capabilities to manage critical risks, and executes appropriate board and stakeholder reporting.
federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and conform to regulatory expectations.
market risk management market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, and volatilities will reduce key's income and the value of its portfolios. these factors influence prospective yields, values, or prices associated with the instrument. for example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline when market interest rates increase, while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase. the holder of a financial instrument is exposed to market risk when either the cash flows or the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors.
we are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities, which include asset and liability management activities. our trading positions are carried at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement. these positions are subject to various market-based risk factors that impact the fair value of the financial instruments in the trading category. our traditional banking loan and deposit products as well as long-term debt and certain short-term borrowings are nontrading positions. these positions are generally carried at the principal amount outstanding for assets and the amount owed for
71
liabilities. the nontrading positions are subject to changes in economic value due to varying market conditions, primarily changes in interest rates.
trading market risk key incurs market risk as a result of trading, investing, and client facilitation activities, principally within key corporate bank. key has exposures to a wide range of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and commodity prices, as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads. our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading activities in the derivative and fixed income markets and maintaining positions in these instruments. we maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow, make markets in securities, and hedge certain risks. the majority of our positions are traded in active markets.
management of trading market risks. market risk management is an integral part of key's risk culture. the risk committee of our board provides oversight of trading market risks. the erm committee and the market risk committee regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our mrm that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities. market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the market risk committee, a tier 2 risk governance committee, and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment.
the mrm is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify, measure, and monitor market risks throughout our company. the mrm is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management. the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. market risk is monitored through various measures, such as var, and through routine stress testing, sensitivity, and scenario analyses. the mrm conducts stress tests for each covered position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios. var, stressed var, and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management.
covered positions.  we monitor the market risk of our covered positions, which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions, regardless of whether the position is in a trading account. all positions in the trading account are recorded at fair value, and changes in fair value are reflected in our consolidated statements of income. information regarding our fair value policies, procedures, and methodologies is provided in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") under the heading "fair value measurements" and note 7 ("fair value measurements") in this report. instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities, such as bank-issued debt and loan portfolios, equity positions that are not actively traded, and securities financing activities, do not meet the definition of a covered position. the mrm is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or non-covered. the covered position working group develops the final list of covered positions, and a summary is provided to the market risk committee.
our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below. we analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions, and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type. the descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios.
•   fixed income includes those instruments associated with our capital markets business and the trading of securities as a dealer. these instruments may include positions in municipal bonds, bonds backed by the u.s. government, agency and corporate bonds, certain mortgage-backed securities, securities issued by the u.s. treasury, money markets, and certain cmos. the activities and instruments within the fixed income portfolio create exposures to interest rate and credit spread risks.
•   interest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps, caps, and floors, which are transacted primarily to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients. in addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to offset or mitigate the interest rate risk related to the client positions. the activities within this portfolio create exposures to interest rate risk.
•   credit derivatives generally include credit default swap indexes, which are used to manage the credit risk exposure associated with anticipated sales of certain commercial real estate loans. the transactions within the credit derivatives portfolio result in exposure to counterparty credit risk and market risk.
var and stressed var.  var is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level. stressed var is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios. the mrm calculates var and stressed var on a daily basis, and the results are distributed to appropriate management. var and stressed var results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations.
72
we use a historical var model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions. historical scenarios are customized for specific covered positions, and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation. additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features, such as options and cancelable provisions. var is calculated using daily observations over a one-year time horizon, and approximates a 95% confidence level. statistically, this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter. we also calculate var and stressed var at a 99% confidence level.
the var model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our covered positions. however, there are limitations inherent in the var model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance. historical results may not be indicative of future results, and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the var model. we regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques, inputs and assumptions used. our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our var model by key's risk management group on an annual basis. the model risk management committee oversees the model validation program, and results of validations are discussed with the erm committee.
actual losses for the total covered positions did not exceed aggregate daily var on any day during the quarters ended december 31, 2016, and december 31, 2015. the mrm backtests our var model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power. the test compares var model results at the 99% confidence level to daily held profit and loss. results of backtesting are provided to the market risk committee. backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed var.
we do not engage in correlation trading, or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk. our net var approach incorporates diversification, but our var calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives.
the aggregate var at the 99% confidence level for all covered positions was $1.9 million at december 31, 2016, and $1.2 million at december 31, 2015. the increase in aggregate var was primarily due to the composition of our fixed income portfolio. figure 32 summarizes our var at the 99% confidence level for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31, 2016, and december 31, 2015. during this period, none of our significant portfolios daily trading var numbers exceeded their var limits or stress var limits.

internal capital adequacy assessment.  market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment. our risk-weighted assets include a market risk-equivalent asset position, which consists of a var component, stressed var component, a de minimis exposure amount, and a specific risk add-on, which are added together to arrive at total market risk equivalent
73
assets. specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments, which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach. specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the mrm, and approved by the chief market risk officer.
nontrading market risk most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products, as well as investments, hedging relationships, long-term debt, and certain short-term borrowings. interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve. such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and within board-approved policy limits.
interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, changes in market interest rates that affect client activity, and our hedging, investing, funding, and capital positions. the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk, basis risk, yield curve risk, and option risk.
the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury. the risk committee of our board provides oversight of nontrading market risk. the erm committee and the alco review reports on the components of interest rate risk described above as well as sensitivity analyses of these exposures. these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk, including recommending, approving, and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges. the a/lm policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco. internal and external emerging issues are monitored on a daily basis. the mrm, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight.
•   "reprice risk" is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest-bearing liabilities and the volume of interest-earning assets they fund (e.g., deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.
•   "basis risk" is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indexes.
•   "yield curve risk" is the exposure to non-parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) and occurs when interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve.
•   "option risk" is the exposure to a customer or counterparty's ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets, liabilities, or off-balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty. option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation.
net interest income simulation analysis.  the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. for purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments, and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view. while simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures are managed within the risk appetite and board approved policy limits, the results also reflect management's desired interest rate risk positioning. achieving the current modeled position typically requires purchases of investment securities to replace security cash flows and the execution of new interest rate swaps. the simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if interest rates were to gradually increase or decrease over the next 12 months. our standard rate scenarios encompass a gradual, parallel increase or decrease of 200 basis points, but due to the low interest rate environment, we have modified the standard decrease scenario to a gradual, parallel decrease of 75 basis points over five months with no change over the following seven months. after calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes, we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment.
74
figure 34 presents the results of the simulation analysis at december 31, 2016, and december 31, 2015. at december 31, 2016, our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was modestly asset sensitive. tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual, parallel 200 basis point increase or 75 basis point decrease in interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 5.5%. in december 2016, the federal reserve increased the range for the federal funds target rate, which led to an increase in the magnitude of the declining rate scenario to 75 basis points. as a result of the change, our modeled exposure to declining rates increased. the modeled exposure depends on the relationships of interest rates on our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. as shown in figure 34, we are operating within these levels as of december 31, 2016.

simulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the model. we tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. however, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, changes in management's desired interest rate risk positioning, investment, funding and hedging activities, and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events.
we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve, including steepening or flattening of the yield curve, changes in credit spreads, immediate changes in market interest rates, and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions: loan and deposit balances, the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, investment, funding and hedging activities, and liquidity and capital management strategies.
the results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure 34. net interest income is highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency, and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships, lending spreads, and the balance behavior of transaction accounts. the modeling is sensitive to the volume of fixed rate assets and liabilities incorporated. the modeling currently assumes approximately $28 billion of investment security purchases and swap executions over the next three years. for every immediate reduction in fixed rate assets of $1 billion, the modeled benefit to rising rates would increase by approximately 30 basis points. the low level of interest rates increases the uncertainty of assumptions for deposit balance behavior and deposit repricing relationships to market interest rates. our historical deposit repricing betas in the last rising rate cycle ranged between 50% and 60% for interest-bearing deposits, and we continue to make similar assumptions in our modeling, with the modeled betas varying by customer segment and product type. recent deposit repricing has been lower than our modeled assumptions. in the modeling, if the deposit beta for the first 25 basis point move in the fed funds target rate was zero, then returned to the standard modeled betas for the next 175 basis points of rate increases, our modeled asset sensitive benefit would increase by approximately 200 basis points. the sensitivity testing of assumptions supports our confidence that actual results are likely to be within 100 basis points of modeled results.
our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity, and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows. treasury discretionary activities related to funding, investing, and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows, or changes in management's desired interest rate risk positioning. as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile.
75
we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12-month horizon. to capture longer-term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes of the eve as discussed in the following section.
economic value of equity modeling. eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12-, 24-, and 36-month horizons. eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, measuring the resulting change in the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment. because the calculation of eve under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points, we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate 100 basis point decrease. this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. we are operating within these guidelines as of december 31, 2016.
management of interest rate exposure. we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate a/lm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives - predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.
figure 35 shows all swap positions that we hold for a/lm purposes. these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. for example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a "receive fixed/pay variable" interest rate swap. the volume, maturity, and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader a/lm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile, see note 9 ("derivatives and hedging activities").

liquidity risk management liquidity risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences. liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.
governance structure we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity's capacity to manage through adverse conditions. the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding.

the management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within corporate treasury. oversight and governance is provided by the board, the erm committee, the alco, and the chief risk officer. the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the alco. the mrm, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight. our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the federal reserve board's enhanced prudential standards.
these committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests, and goal tracking reports. the reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends, and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions. when liquidity pressure is elevated, positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive. to ensure that emerging issues are identified, we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis.
factors affecting liquidity our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general, may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.
our credit ratings at december 31, 2016, are shown in figure 36. we believe these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable keycorp or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors.

we regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. in the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank. in a "heightened monitoring mode," we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment. our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies. erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.
we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period. as part of the plan, we maintain on-balance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio, which consists of high quality liquid assets. during a problem period, that reserve could be used as a source of
77
funding to provide time to develop and execute a longer-term strategy. the liquid asset portfolio at december 31, 2016, totaled $24.2 billion, consisting of $21.7 billion of unpledged securities, $416 million of securities available for secured funding at the fhlb, and $2.1 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account. the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity, heightened risk, or prefunding of expected outflows, such as debt maturities. additionally, as of december 31, 2016, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $27.4 billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and $6.4 billion at the fhlb of cincinnati. in 2016, key's outstanding fhlb of cincinnati advances were reduced by $40 million due to repayments.
final u.s. liquidity coverage ratio under the liquidity coverage rules, we will be required to calculate the modified lcr for key. at december 31, 2016, our estimated modified lcr was above 100%. in the future, we may change the composition of our investment portfolio, increase the size of the overall investment portfolio, and modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position.
additional information about the liquidity coverage rules and modified lcr is included in the "supervision and regulation" section under the heading "regulatory capital requirements - liquidity requirements" in item 1 of this report.
long-term liquidity strategy our long-term liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits. however, we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands, and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives. key's client-based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base that, in conjunction with intermediate and long-term wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base, supports our liquidity risk management strategy. we use the loan-to-deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies. our target loan-to-deposit ratio is 90-100% (at december 31, 2016, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 85%), which we calculate as total loans, loans held for sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits.
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits, wholesale funding, and liquid assets. if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or on-balance sheet liquid reserves. conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing, and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets.
liquidity programs we have several liquidity programs, which are described in note 19 ("long-term debt"), that are designed to enable keycorp and keybank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets. the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. these liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the board and are renewed and replaced as necessary. there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs.
on march 8, 2016, keybank issued $1 billion of 2.35% senior bank notes due march 8, 2019, under its global bank note program.
on may 20, 2016, keybank issued $600 million of 3.40% subordinated bank notes due may 20, 2026, under its global bank note program.
on august 22, 2016, keybank issued $500 million of 1.60% senior bank notes due august 22, 2019, under its global bank note program.
on september 9, 2016, keycorp issued $525 million of depositary shares, each representing a 1/25th ownership interest in a share of our fixed-to-floating rate perpetual noncumulative series d preferred stock. our series d preferred stock has a $1 par value with a $25,000 liquidation preference.
on november 22, 2016, keybank issued $500 million of 2.50% senior bank notes and $250 million of floating rate senior bank notes indexed to 3-month libor, both due november 22, 2021, under its global bank note program.
78
on december 12, 2016, keycorp issued $500 million of depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of our fixed-to-floating rate perpetual noncumulative series e preferred stock. our series e preferred stock has a $1 par value with a $1,000 liquidation preference.
liquidity for keycorp the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends, primarily from keybank. keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions); support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries' obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders.
we use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity. the parent cash coverage months metric measures the months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current amount of liquidity. we generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from keybank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels. the parent company generally maintains cash and short-term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months. at december 31, 2016, keycorp held $3.4 billion in short-term investments, which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations, including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance.
typically, keycorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank, supplemented with term debt. federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. a national bank's dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. during 2016, keybank paid $625 million in dividends to keycorp, while other non-bank subsidiaries paid $50 million in dividends to keycorp. at january 1, 2017, keybank had regulatory capacity to pay $224 million in dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval.
our liquidity position and recent activity over the past 12 months, our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios, has increased as a result of an increase in unpledged securities offset by net customer loan and deposit flows. the liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longer-term solution.
from time to time, keycorp or keybank may seek to retire, repurchase, or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities, preferred shares, or common shares through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. additional information on repurchases of common shares by keycorp is included in part ii, item 5. market for the registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this report. such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements, and other factors. the amounts involved may be material, individually or collectively.
we generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities. we have approximately $169 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in international tax jurisdictions as of december 31, 2016. as we consider alternative long-term strategic and liquidity plans, opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately $3 million in taxes to be paid. we have included the appropriate amount as a deferred tax liability at december 31, 2016.
the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended december 31, 2016, and december 31, 2015.
credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor's inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities, and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk.
79
credit policy, approval, and evaluation we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. the credit risk committee approves both retail and commercial credit policies. these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit.
our credit risk management team is responsible for credit approval, is independent of our lines of business, and consists of senior officers who have extensive experience in structuring and approving loans. only credit risk management members are authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies. it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate, but most major lending units have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations.
loan grades are assigned at the time of origination, verified by the credit risk management team and periodically reevaluated thereafter. most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring. this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling. commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings. the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation; the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility. default probability is determined based on, among other factors, the financial strength of the borrower, an assessment of the borrower's management, the borrower's competitive position within its industry sector, and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook. types of exposure, transaction structure and collateral, including credit risk mitigants, affect the expected recovery assessment.
our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans. these models, known as scorecards, forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant. the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system, which allows for real-time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products. we periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes.
we maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios. for individual obligors, we employ a sliding scale of exposure, known as hold limits, which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower. our legal lending limit is approximately $2.1 billion for any individual borrower. however, internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20% of that amount. as of december 31, 2016, we had seven client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than $200 million. the average amount outstanding on these seven individual net obligor commitments was $55 million at december 31, 2016. in general, our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures.
we actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate portfolio credit risk. we utilize credit default swaps on a limited basis to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party. at december 31, 2016, we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of $210 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations. we may also sell credit derivatives - primarily single name credit default swaps - to offset our purchased credit default swap position prior to maturity. at december 31, 2016, we did not have any sold credit default swaps outstanding.
credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection, are included in the "corporate services income" and "other income" components of noninterest income.
allowance for loan and lease losses at december 31, 2016, the alll was $858 million, or 1.00% of period-end loans, compared to $796 million, or 1.33%, at december 31, 2015. the allowance includes $37 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $501 million at december 31, 2016, compared to $35 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $308 million at december 31, 2015. for more information about impaired loans, see note 6 ("asset quality"). at december 31, 2016, the alll was 137.3% of nonperforming loans, compared to 205.7% at december 31, 2015.
selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five years are presented in figure 37. the factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section.

we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis. the methodology used is described in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") under the heading "allowance for loan and lease losses." briefly, our allowance applies incurred loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics. we exercise judgment to assess any adjustment to the incurred loss rates for the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, lending policies including underwriting standards, and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets.
for all commercial and consumer loan tdrs, regardless of size, as well as impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance of $2.5 million or greater, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. we estimate the extent of the individual impairment for commercial loans and tdrs by comparing the recorded investment of the loan with the estimated present value of its future cash flows, the fair value of its underlying collateral, or the loan's observable market price. secured consumer loan tdrs that are discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally re-affirmed are adjusted to reflect the fair value of the underlying collateral, less costs to sell. other consumer loan tdrs are combined in homogenous pools and assigned a specific allocation based on the estimated present value of future cash flows using the effective interest rate. a specific allowance also may be assigned - even when sources of repayment appear sufficient - if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. on at least a quarterly basis, we evaluate the appropriateness of our loss estimation methods to reduce differences between estimated incurred losses and actual losses. the alll at december 31, 2016, represents our best estimate of the incurred credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date.
as shown in figure 38, our alll from continuing operations remained relatively stable, increasing by $62 million, or 7.8%, since 2015. our allowance applies expected loss rates to our existing loans with similar risk characteristics as well as any adjustments to reflect our current assessment of qualitative factors, such as changes in economic conditions, underwriting standards, and concentrations of credit. our commercial alll increased by $60 million, or 9.1%, since 2015 primarily because of loan growth in commercial, financial and agricultural portfolio and an increase in incurred loss estimates during 2015 and into 2016 primarily due to the continued depressed oil and gas prices since 2014. our consumer alll increased by $2 million, or 1.4%, since 2015. our consumer alll increase was primarily due to the addition of the acquired credit card and consumer direct portfolios, which were acquired at a premium. this increase was partially offset by continued improvement in credit metrics, which have decreased expected loss rates since 2014. the continued improvement in the consumer portfolio credit quality metrics since 2015 was primarily due to benefits of relatively stable economic conditions and improved delinquency rates, average credit bureau scores, and residential ltvs.

(a)   excludes allocations of the alll related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business in the amount of $24 million at december 31, 2016, $28 million at december 31, 2015, $29 million at december 31, 2014, $39 million at december 31, 2013, and $55 million at december 31, 2012.
our provision for credit losses was $266 million for 2016, compared to $166 million for 2015. the increase in our provision is primarily related to the addition of the acquired credit card and consumer direct portfolios, which were acquired at a premium, increased charge-offs, primarily in the oil and gas portfolio in 2016 compared to 2015, and loan growth. we continue to reduce our exposure in our higher-risk businesses, including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio, marine/rv financing, and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans, payments from borrowers, or net loan charge-offs.
asset quality in our oil and gas loan portfolio, which represents approximately 1% of total loans at december 31, 2016, performed in-line with our expectations in 2016. our reserve for credit losses allocated to our oil and gas loan exposure was 6% of the total oil and gas loan portfolio at december 31, 2016, and reflected the estimated impact of current oil prices at that date.
net loan charge-offs net loan charge-offs for 2016 totaled $205 million, or .29% of average loans, compared to net loan charge-offs of $142 million, or .24%, for the same period last year. figure 39 shows the trend in our net loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in figure 40.
over the past 12 months, net loan charge-offs increased $63 million. this increase is attributable to the growth in our loan portfolio and higher charge-offs in our commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio over the same period.

(d)   restructured loans (i.e., tdrs) are those for which key, for reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. these concessions are made to improve the collectability of the loan and generally take the form of a reduction of the interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance.
as shown in figure 41, nonperforming assets increased during 2016. most of the increase came from nonperforming loans in our commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio, primarily due to credit migration in the oil and gas portfolio.

operational and compliance risk management like all businesses, we are subject to operational risk, which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. these events include, among other things, threats to our cybersecurity, as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities.
operational risk also encompasses compliance risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices, and ethical standards. under the dodd-frank act, large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation. this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk. we have created work teams to respond to and analyze the regulatory requirements that have been or will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the dodd-frank act. resulting operational risk losses and/or additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation, or foregone opportunities.
we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, and a system of internal controls and reporting. we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and regulations. for example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses. this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes. this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board.
the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles, and responsibilities, as well as the content, to manage operational risk for key. the compliance risk committee serves the same function in managing compliance risk for key. primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee are senior
86
management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities. these committees and the operational risk management and compliance functions are an integral part of our erm program. our risk review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management and compliance programs and our system of internal controls. risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the risk and audit committees and independently supports the risk committee's oversight of these controls.
cybersecurity we maintain comprehensive cyber incident response plans, and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems, or cause other damage. we and many other u.s. financial institutions have experienced distributed denial-of-service attacks from technologically sophisticated third parties. these attacks are intended to disrupt or disable consumer online banking services and prevent banking transactions. we also periodically experience other attempts to breach the security of our systems and data. these cyberattacks have not, to date, resulted in any material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers, and have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
cyberattack risks may also occur with our third-party technology service providers, and may interfere with their ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, with attendant potential for financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. recent high-profile cyberattacks have targeted retailers and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information (including personal, financial, and credit card information) of customers, some of whom are customers of ours. we may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks. risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking, and other technology-based products and services by us and our clients.
fourth quarter results figure 44 shows our financial performance for each of the past eight quarters. highlights of our results for the fourth quarter of 2016 are summarized below.
earnings our fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders was $213 million, or $.20 per common share, compared to $224 million, or $.27 per common share, for the fourth quarter of 2015.
on an annualized basis, our return on average total assets from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2016 was .69%, compared to .97% for the fourth quarter of 2015. the annualized return on average common equity from continuing operations was 7.88% for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to 9.50% for the year-ago quarter.
net interest income fourth quarter 2016 net interest income included $92 million of purchase accounting accretion related to the acquisition of first niagara, including $34 million related to refinement of third quarter 2016 purchase accounting estimates.
our taxable-equivalent net interest income was $948 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, and the net interest margin was 3.12%. these results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $610 million and a net interest margin of 2.87% for the fourth quarter of 2015. the $338 million increase in net interest income and 25 basis point increase in net interest margin reflects the benefit from the acquisition of first niagara and ongoing business activity.
noninterest income our noninterest income was $618 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $485 million for the year-ago quarter. the increase was driven by the acquisition of first niagara, as well as continued positive momentum in our core businesses. investment banking and debt placement fees, cards and payments income, service charges on deposit accounts, and other income all contributed to the growth.

noninterest expense our noninterest expense was $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016. during the quarter, we incurred merger-related costs of $207 million and a pension settlement charge of $18 million. the merger-related charges were primarily made up of $80 million in personnel expense related to systems conversions, as well as fully-dedicated personnel for merger and integration efforts. the remaining $127 million of merger-related charges were nonpersonnel expense, largely recognized in net occupancy, computer processing, business services and professional fees, and marketing expense.
excluding merger-related charges, noninterest expense was $283 million higher than the fourth quarter of last year. the increase from the prior year, reflected in both personnel and nonpersonnel expense, was largely driven by the acquisition of first niagara, as well as higher incentive and stock-based compensation. additionally, we incurred $14 million in an increased pension settlement charge, and intangible asset amortization increased $18 million.
provision for credit losses our provision for credit losses was $66 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $45 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. our alll was $858 million, or 1.00% of total period-end loans, at december 31, 2016, compared to $796 million, or 1.33%, at december 31, 2015.
net loan charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2016 totaled $72 million, or .34% of average loans, compared to $37 million, or .25%, for the same period last year.
income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of $38 million, compared to a tax provision of $73 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 14.1%, compared to 23.9% for the same quarter one year ago, due to lower pretax income resulting from merger-related charges, increased energy tax credits associated with leasing activities and a reduction of valuation allowances related to capital loss carryforwards.

critical accounting policies and estimates our business is dynamic and complex. consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. these choices are critical; not only are they necessary to comply with gaap, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. all accounting policies are important, and all policies described in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance.
in our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them.
as described below, we rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions. we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee.
allowance for loan and lease losses the loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our balance sheet. we consider a variety of data to determine probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio and to establish an allowance that is sufficient to absorb those losses. for example, we apply expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, underwriting standards, and concentrations of credit. other considerations include expected cash flows and estimated collateral values.
for all commercial and consumer tdrs, regardless of size, as well as all other impaired commercial loans with outstanding balances of $2.5 million or greater, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. for example, a specific allowance may be assigned - even when sources of repayment appear sufficient - if we remain uncertain that an impaired loan will be repaid in full.
we continually assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio and adjust the alll when appropriate. the economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly, and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower. however, since our total loan portfolio is well diversified in many respects, and the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio may be improving while the risk profile of others is deteriorating, we may decide to change the level of the allowance for one segment of the portfolio without changing it for any other segment.
in addition to adjusting the alll to reflect market conditions, we also may adjust the allowance because of unique events that are likely to cause actual losses to vary abruptly and significantly from expected losses. for example, class action lawsuits brought against an industry segment (e.g., one that used asbestos in its product) can cause a precipitous deterioration in the risk profile of borrowers doing business in that segment. conversely, the dismissal of such lawsuits can improve the risk profile. in either case, historical loss rates for that industry segment would not have provided a precise basis for determining the appropriate level of allowance.
even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect management's determination of the appropriate allowance because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio. to illustrate, an increase in estimated losses equal to one-tenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of december 31, 2016, would indicate the need for a $24 million increase in the allowance. the same increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a $62 million increase in the allowance. such adjustments to the alll can materially affect financial results. following the above examples, a $24 million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an after-tax basis by approximately $15 million, or $.02 per common share; a $62 million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an after-tax basis by approximately $39 million, or $.04 per common share.
92
as we make decisions regarding the allowance, we benefit from a lengthy organizational history and experience with credit evaluations and related outcomes. nonetheless, if our underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate, the alll would likely need to be adjusted, possibly having an adverse effect on our results of operations.
our accounting policy related to the allowance is disclosed in note 1 under the heading "allowance for loan and lease losses."
valuation methodologies we follow the applicable accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. in the absence of quoted market prices, we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities using internally developed models, which are based on third-party data as well as our judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant market available inputs. we describe our application of this accounting guidance, the process used to determine fair values, and the fair value hierarchy in note 1 under the heading "fair value measurements," and in note 7 ("fair value measurements").
valuation methodologies often involve significant judgment, particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued. to determine the values of assets and liabilities, as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired, we make assumptions and estimates related to discount rates, asset returns, prepayment rates and other factors. the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results. the outcomes of valuations that we perform have a direct bearing on the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities, including loans held for sale, principal investments, goodwill, and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.
at december 31, 2016, $22.1 billion, or 16%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. substantially all of these assets were classified as level 1 or level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. at december 31, 2016, $1.5 billion, or 1%, of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. substantially all of these liabilities were classified as level 1 or level 2.
at december 31, 2016, $22 million, or less than 1%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. all of these assets were classified as level 3. at december 31, 2016, there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
during 2016, we elected the fair value option for our real estate - residential mortgage loans held for sale. a discussion of the valuation methodology applied to our loans held for sale is included in note 1 under the heading "loans held for sale."
our principal investments include direct and indirect investments, predominantly in privately-held companies. the fair values of these investments are determined by considering a number of factors, including the target company's financial condition and results of operations, values of public companies in comparable businesses, market liquidity, and the nature and duration of resale restrictions. the fair value of principal investments was $185 million at december 31, 2016. a 10% positive or negative variance in that fair value would have increased or decreased our 2016 earnings by approximately $19 million ($12 million after tax, or $.01 per common share).
the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note 1 under the heading "goodwill and other intangible assets." accounting guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is required. we chose to utilize this qualitative assessment in our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2016 and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were less than their respective carrying values. our reporting units for purposes of the analysis are our two major business segments: key community bank and key corporate bank.
if we chose the quantitative assessment, we would perform the two step goodwill impairment test. the first step in goodwill impairment testing is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. this amount is estimated using comparable external market data (market approach) and discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium and earnings forecast information (income approach). the amount of capital being allocated to our reporting units as a proxy for the carrying value is based on risk-based regulatory capital requirements. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill impairment may be indicated. in such a case, we would perform the second step of goodwill impairment testing, and we would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit (representing the unit's fair value). then we would compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the unit's net assets (excluding goodwill). any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit's net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill. if the
93
carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the impairment loss represented by this difference is charged to earnings.
the acquisition of pacific crest securities during the third quarter of 2014 resulted in a $78 million increase in the goodwill recorded in the key corporate bank unit. approximately $72 million of the goodwill was allocated to kbcm in the second quarter of 2015, when pacific crest securities was fully merged into kbcm. during the third quarter of 2015, goodwill increased $3 million to account for a tax item associated with the pacific crest business combination. the acquisition of first niagara during the third quarter of 2016 resulted in a $1.4 billion increase in goodwill. as a result of the acquisition, $1.1 billion of goodwill was allocated to key community bank and $277 million of goodwill was allocated to key corporate bank. additional information is provided in note 11 ("goodwill and other intangible assets").
the primary assumptions used in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses, including sensitivity analysis of these assumptions, are presented in note 17 ("employee benefits").
when potential asset impairment is identified, we must exercise judgment to determine the nature of the potential impairment (i.e., temporary or other-than-temporary) to apply the appropriate accounting treatment. for example, unrealized losses on securities available for sale that are deemed temporary are recorded in shareholders' equity; those deemed "other-than-temporary" are recorded in either earnings or shareholders' equity based on certain factors. additional information regarding temporary and other-than-temporary impairment on securities available for sale at december 31, 2016, is provided in note 8 ("securities").
derivatives and hedging we primarily use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes. these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified on-balance sheet assets and liabilities. our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance, which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value, after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements. accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship.
the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance, as well as to assess hedge effectiveness, identify similar hedged item groupings, and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items. we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices. draft accounting guidance has been exposed that could result in material changes to our accounting for derivative financial instruments and related hedging activities. although such changes may not have a material effect on our financial condition, a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it occurs. additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note 1 under the heading "derivatives," and note 9 ("derivatives and hedging activities").
contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes note 21 ("commitments, contingent liabilities, and guarantees") summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor, and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations. we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee, but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount. see note 21 for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december 31, 2016.
it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake. in the normal course of business, we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities. we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate. however, if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate, the tax reserves may need to be adjusted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital.
additionally, we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, and therefore recorded. the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods, projected future taxable income, potential tax-planning strategies, and projected future reversals of deferred tax items. these assessments are subjective and may change. based on these criteria, and in particular our projections for future taxable income, we currently believe it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize our net deferred tax asset in future
94
periods. however, if our assessments prove incorrect, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur. for further information on our accounting for income taxes, see note 13 ("income taxes").
during 2016, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates.

(b)   represents contracts to hedge our balance sheet asset and liability needs, and to accommodate our clients' trading and/or hedging needs. our derivative mark-to-market exposures are calculated and reported on a daily basis. these exposures are largely covered by cash or highly marketable securities collateral with daily collateral calls.

item 1a.    risk factors in addition to the matters set forth under "safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995" included immediately prior to item 1, business, above, we are subject to a variety of significant risks. our susceptibility to certain risks, including those discussed in detail below, could exacerbate other risks. these risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our risk profile.
cyber attacks could severely impair operations, negatively impact our business, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and adversely affect our reputation.
a successful cyber attack on the information technology systems that control our transmission and distribution systems, generation facilities or other assets could impair or prevent us from managing these systems and facilities, operating our systems effectively, or properly managing our data, networks and programs. the breach of certain information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. a major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and to repair system damage or security breaches and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to our reputation.
we have instituted safeguards to protect our information technology systems and assets. we devote substantial resources to network and application security, encryption and other measures to protect our computer systems and infrastructure from unauthorized access or misuse and interface with numerous external entities to improve our cybersecurity situational awareness. the ferc, through the north american electric reliability corporation, requires certain safeguards to be implemented to deter cyber attacks. these safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks.
any such cyber breaches could result in loss of service to customers and a significant decrease in revenues, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
acts of war or terrorism, both threatened and actual, or physical attacks could adversely affect our ability to operate our systems and could adversely affect our financial results and liquidity.
acts of war or terrorism, both threatened and actual, or actual physical attacks that damage our transmission and distribution systems, generation facilities or other assets could negatively impact our ability to transmit, distribute or generate energy, or operate our systems efficiently or at all. because our transmission systems and generation facilities are part of an interconnected regional grid, we face the risk of blackout due to grid disturbances or disruptions on a neighboring interconnected system. if our assets were physically damaged and were not recovered in a timely manner, it could result in a loss of service to customers and a significant decrease in revenues.
any such acts of war or terrorism, physical attacks or grid disturbances could result in a significant decrease in revenues, significant expense to repair system damage, costs associated with governmental actions in response to such attacks, and liability claims, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
strategic development opportunities may not be successful and projects may not commence operation as scheduled or be completed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects.
we are pursuing broader strategic development investment opportunities that will benefit the new england region related to the construction of electric and natural gas transmission facilities, off-shore wind electric generation facilities, interconnections to generating resources and other investment opportunities. the development, construction and expansion of electric transmission and generation facilities and natural gas transmission facilities involve numerous risks. various factors could result in increased costs or result in delays or cancellation of these projects. risks include regulatory approval processes, new legislation, economic events or factors, environmental and community concerns, design and siting issues, difficulties in obtaining required rights of way, competition from incumbent utilities and other entities, and actions of strategic partners. should any of these factors result in such delays or cancellations, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected or our future growth opportunities may not be realized as anticipated.
as a result of legislative and regulatory changes during 2015, the states in which we provide service have implemented new procedures to select for construction new major electric transmission and natural gas pipeline facilities. these procedures require the review of competing projects and permit the selection of only those projects that are expected to provide the greatest benefit to customers. if the projects in which we have invested are not selected for construction, it could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
the actions of regulators and legislators can significantly affect our earnings, liquidity and business activities.
the rates that our electric and natural gas companies charge their customers are determined by their state regulatory commissions and by the ferc. these commissions also regulate the companies' accounting, operations, the issuance of certain securities and certain other matters. the ferc also regulates the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at wholesale, accounting, issuance of certain securities and certain other matters.
under state and federal law, our electric and natural gas companies are entitled to charge rates that are sufficient to allow them an opportunity to recover their reasonable operating and capital costs, to attract needed capital and maintain their financial integrity, while also protecting relevant public interests. each of these companies prepares and submits periodic rate filings with their respective regulatory commissions for review and approval.
17
the ferc has jurisdiction over our transmission costs recovery and the allowed roe. the roe has been contested by outside parties as unjust and unreasonable. certain outside parties have filed four complaints against all electric companies under the jurisdiction of iso-ne alleging that the roe is unjust and unreasonable. the first complaint, which was concluded in 2015, resulted in a decrease of the allowed roe. the second and third complaints are currently under review with the ferc. the fourth complaint period currently has not concluded. the ferc has initiated a review of the regional and local transmission rates due to a lack of adequate transparency. the ferc also found that the formula rates generally lacked sufficient details to determine how costs are derived and recovered in rates.
a federal appeals court decision has upheld the ferc's authority to order major changes to transmission planning and cost allocation in ferc order no. 1000 and order no. 1000-a, including transmission planning for public policy needs, and the requirement that utilities remove from their transmission tariffs their rights of first refusal to build transmission. additionally, the ferc affirmed that it can eliminate our right of first refusal to build transmission in new england even though the ferc previously approved and granted special protections to these rights. implementation of ferc's goals in new england, including within our service territories, may expose us to competition for construction of transmission projects, additional regulatory considerations, and potential delay with respect to future transmission projects, which may adversely affect our results of operation.
there is no assurance that the commissions will approve the recovery of all costs incurred by our electric and natural gas companies, including costs for construction, operation and maintenance, as well as a reasonable return on their respective regulated assets. the amount of costs incurred by the companies, coupled with increases in fuel and energy prices, could lead to consumer or regulatory resistance to the timely recovery of such costs, thereby adversely affecting our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
we outsource certain business functions to third-party suppliers and service providers, and substandard performance by those third parties could harm our business, reputation and results of operations.
we outsource certain services to third parties in areas including information technology, transaction processing, human resources, payroll and payroll processing and other areas. outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to substandard quality of service delivery or substandard deliverables, which may result in missed deadlines or other timeliness issues, non-compliance (including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards) or reputational harm, which could negatively impact our results of operations. we also continue to pursue enhancements to standardize our systems and processes. if any difficulties in the operation of these systems were to occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations, or adversely affect our ability to work with regulators, unions, customers or employees.
new technology, energy conservation measures and distributed generation could adversely affect our operations and financial results.
advances in technology that reduce the costs of alternative methods of producing electric energy to a level that is competitive with that of current electric production methods, could result in loss of market share and customers, and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive. these changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize energy, which could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses. economic downturns or periods of high energy supply costs typically can lead to the development of legislative and regulatory policy designed to promote reductions in energy consumption and increased energy efficiency and self-generation by customers. customers' increased use of energy efficiency measures, distributed generation and energy storage technology could result in lower demand. reduced demand due to energy efficiency measures and the use of distributed generation, to the extent not substantially offset through ratemaking or decoupling mechanisms, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our transmission, distribution and generation systems may not operate as expected, and could require unplanned expenditures, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
our ability to properly operate our transmission, distribution and generation systems is critical to the financial performance of our business. our transmission, distribution and generation businesses face several operational risks, including the breakdown, failure of, or damage to operating equipment, information technology systems, or processes, especially due to age; labor disputes; disruptions in the delivery of electricity and natural gas, including impacts on us or our customers; increased capital expenditure requirements, including those due to environmental regulation; catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, or other similar occurrences; extreme weather conditions beyond equipment and plant design capacity; other unanticipated operations and maintenance expenses and liabilities; and potential claims for property damage or personal injuries beyond the scope of our insurance coverage. many of our transmission projects are expected to alleviate identified reliability issues and reduce customers' costs. however, if the in-service date for one or more of these projects is delayed due to economic events or factors, or regulatory or other delays, the risk of failures in the electricity transmission system may increase. any failure of our transmission, distribution and generation systems to operate as planned may result in increased capital costs, reduced earnings or unplanned increases in operation and maintenance costs. outages at generating stations may be deemed imprudent by the nhpuc resulting in disallowance of replacement power and repair costs. such costs that are not recoverable from our customers would have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
severe storms could cause significant damage to any of our facilities requiring extensive expenditures, the recovery for which is subject to approval by regulators.
severe weather, such as ice and snow storms, hurricanes and other natural disasters, may cause outages and property damage, which may require us to incur additional costs that may not be recoverable from customers. the cost of repairing damage to our operating subsidiaries' facilities and the potential disruption of their operations due to storms, natural disasters or other catastrophic events could be substantial, particularly as regulators and customers demand better and quicker response times to outages. if, upon review, any of our state regulatory authorities finds that our actions were imprudent, some of those restoration costs may not be recoverable from customers. the inability to recover a significant amount of such costs could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
18
our goodwill is valued and recorded at an amount that, if impaired and written down, could adversely affect our future operating results and total capitalization.
we have a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet, which, as of december 31, 2016, totaled $3.5 billion. the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. we test our goodwill balances for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would indicate a potential for impairment. a determination that goodwill is deemed to be impaired would result in a non-cash charge that could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and total capitalization. the annual goodwill impairment test in 2016 resulted in a conclusion that our goodwill was not impaired.
eversource energy and its utility subsidiaries are exposed to significant reputational risks, which make them vulnerable to increased regulatory oversight or other sanctions.
because utility companies, including our electric and natural gas utility subsidiaries, have large customer bases, they are subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of their distribution services and the speed with which they are able to respond to electric outages, natural gas leaks and similar interruptions caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events. adverse publicity of this nature could harm the reputations of eversource energy and its subsidiaries; may make state legislatures, utility commissions and other regulatory authorities less likely to view them in a favorable light; and may cause them to be subject to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight. unfavorable regulatory outcomes can include more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations, such as reliability and customer service quality standards or vegetation management requirements, as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements. the imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows of eversource energy and each of its utility subsidiaries.
limits on our access to and increases in the cost of capital may adversely impact our ability to execute our business plan.
we use short-term debt and the long-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity and funding for capital requirements not obtained from our operating cash flow. if access to these sources of liquidity becomes constrained, our ability to implement our business strategy could be adversely affected. in addition, higher interest rates would increase our cost of borrowing, which could adversely impact our results of operations. a downgrade of our credit ratings or events beyond our control, such as a disruption in global capital and credit markets, could increase our cost of borrowing and cost of capital or restrict our ability to access the capital markets and negatively affect our ability to maintain and to expand our businesses.
our counterparties may not meet their obligations to us or may elect to exercise their termination rights, which could adversely affect our earnings.
we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to various arrangements who owe us money, have contracted to supply us with energy, coal, or other commodities or services, or who work with us as strategic partners, including on significant capital projects, will not be able to perform their obligations, will terminate such arrangements or, with respect to our credit facilities, fail to honor their commitments. should any of these counterparties fail to perform their obligations or terminate such arrangements, we might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at higher market prices and/or have to delay the completion of, or cancel a capital project. should any lenders under our credit facilities fail to perform, the level of borrowing capacity under those arrangements could decrease. in any such events, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected.
the unauthorized access to and the misappropriation of confidential and proprietary customer, employee, financial or system operating information could adversely affect our business operations and adversely impact our reputation.
in the regular course of business we maintain sensitive customer, employee, financial and system operating information and are required by various federal and state laws to safeguard this information. cyber intrusions, security breaches, theft or loss of this information by cyber crime or otherwise could lead to the release of critical operating information or confidential customer or employee information, which could adversely affect our business operations or adversely impact our reputation, and could result in significant costs, fines and litigation. we maintain limited privacy protection liability insurance to cover limited damages and defense costs arising from unauthorized disclosure of, or failure to protect, private information, as well as costs for notification to, or for credit card monitoring of, customers, employees and other persons in the event of a breach of private information. this insurance covers amounts paid to avert, prevent or stop a network attack or the disclosure of personal information, and costs of a qualified forensics firm to determine the cause, source and extent of a network attack or to investigate, examine and analyze our network to find the cause, source and extent of a data breach. while we have implemented measures designed to prevent cyber attacks and mitigate their effects should they occur, these measures may not be effective due to the continually evolving nature of efforts to access confidential information.

costs of compliance with regulations, including environmental regulations and climate change legislation, may increase and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
our subsidiaries' operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations that govern, among other things, air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste. compliance with these requirements requires us to incur significant costs relating to environmental monitoring, maintenance and upgrading of facilities, remediation and permitting. the costs of compliance with existing legal requirements or legal requirements not yet adopted may increase in the future. an increase in such costs, unless promptly recovered, could have an adverse impact on our business and our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in addition, global climate change issues have received an increased focus from federal and state government agencies. although we would expect that any costs of these rules and regulations would be recovered from customers, their impact on energy use by customers and the ultimate impact on our business would be dependent upon the specific rules and regulations adopted and cannot be determined at this time. the impact of these additional costs to customers could lead to a further reduction in energy consumption resulting in a decline in electricity and gas sales in our service territories, which would have an adverse impact on our business and financial position, results of operations or cash flows. any failure by us to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if due to factors beyond our control, or reinterpretations of existing requirements, could also increase costs. existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to us. revised or additional laws could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on our facilities or increased compliance costs, which may not be fully recoverable in distribution company rates. the cost impact of any such laws, rules or regulations would be dependent upon the specific requirements adopted and cannot be determined at this time. for further information, see item 1, business - other regulatory and environmental matters, included in this annual report on form 10-k.
market performance or changes in assumptions require us to make significant contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
we provide a defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefits for a substantial number of employees, former employees and retirees. our future pension obligations, costs and liabilities are highly dependent on a variety of factors beyond our control. these factors include estimated investment returns, interest rates, discount rates, health care cost trends, benefit changes, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs could increase significantly.  in addition, various factors, including underperformance of plan investments and changes in law or regulation, could increase the amount of contributions required to fund our pension plan in the future. additional large funding requirements, when combined with the financing requirements of our construction program, could impact the timing and amount of future financings and negatively affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. for further information, see note 9a, "employee benefits - pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions," to the financial statements.
the loss of key personnel or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
our operations depend on the continued efforts of our employees. retaining key employees and maintaining the ability to attract new employees are important to both our operational and financial performance. we cannot guarantee that any member of our management or any key employee at the eversource parent or subsidiary level will continue to serve in any capacity for any particular period of time. in addition, a significant portion of our workforce, including many workers with specialized skills maintaining and servicing the electrical infrastructure, will be eligible to retire over the next five to ten years. such highly skilled individuals cannot be quickly replaced due to the technically complex work they perform. we have developed strategic workforce plans to identify key functions and proactively implement plans to assure a ready and qualified workforce, but cannot predict the impact of these plans on our ability to hire and retain key employees.
as a holding company with no revenue-generating operations, eversource parent's liquidity is dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries, its commercial paper program, and its ability to access the long-term debt and equity capital markets.
eversource parent is a holding company and as such, has no revenue-generating operations of its own. its ability to meet its debt service obligations and to pay dividends on its common shares is largely dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay borrowings from eversource parent, and/or eversource parent's ability to access its commercial paper program or the long-term debt and equity capital markets. prior to funding eversource parent, the subsidiary companies have financial obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, their operating expenses, debt service, preferred dividends of certain subsidiaries, and obligations to trade creditors. additionally, the subsidiary companies could retain their free cash flow to fund their capital expenditures in lieu of receiving equity contributions from eversource parent. should the subsidiary companies not be able to pay dividends or repay funds due to eversource parent, or if eversource parent cannot access its commercial paper programs or the long-term debt and equity capital markets, eversource parent's ability to pay interest, dividends and its own debt obligations would be restricted.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations eversource energy and subsidiaries the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related combined notes included in this combined annual report on form 10-k. references in this annual report on form 10-k to "eversource," the "company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to eversource energy and its consolidated subsidiaries. all per-share amounts are reported on a diluted basis. the consolidated financial statements of eversource, nstar electric and psnh and the financial statements of cl&p and wmeco are herein collectively referred to as the "financial statements."
refer to the glossary of terms included in this combined annual report on form 10-k for abbreviations and acronyms used throughout this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of eversource. the earnings and eps of each business discussed below do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities of such business but rather represent a direct interest in our assets and liabilities, as a whole. eps by business is a financial measure not recognized under gaap that is calculated by dividing the net income attributable to common shareholders of each business by the weighted average diluted eversource common shares outstanding for the period. the discussion below also includes non-gaap financial measures referencing our 2015 and 2014 earnings and eps excluding certain integration costs incurred by eversource parent and our regulated companies. we use these non-gaap financial measures to evaluate and to provide details of earnings by business and to more fully compare and explain our 2016, 2015 and 2014 results without including the impact of these items. due to the nature and significance of these items on net income attributable to common shareholders, we believe that the non-gaap presentation is more representative of our financial performance and provides additional and useful information to readers of this report in analyzing historical and future performance by business. these non-gaap financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to reported net income attributable to common shareholders or eps determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance.
reconciliations of the non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures of consolidated diluted eps and net income attributable to common shareholders are included under "financial condition and business analysis - overview - consolidated" and "financial condition and business analysis - overview - regulated companies" in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, herein.
financial condition and business analysis executive summary results and future outlook:

•   our electric distribution segment, which includes generation results, earned $462.8 million, or $1.46 per share, in 2016, compared with $507.1 million, or $1.59 per share, in 2015. our electric transmission segment earned $370.8 million, or $1.16 per share, in 2016, compared with $304.5 million, or $0.96 per share, in 2015. our natural gas distribution segment earned $77.7 million, or $0.24 per share, in 2016, compared with $72.4 million, or $0.23 per share, in 2015.
•   eversource parent and other companies earned $31.0 million, or $0.10 per share, in 2016, compared with a net loss of $5.5 million, or $0.02 per share, in 2015.
•   we currently project 2017 earnings of between $3.05 per diluted share and $3.20 per diluted share.
liquidity:
•   cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $2.2 billion in 2016, compared with $1.4 billion in 2015. investments in property, plant and equipment totaled $2.0 billion in 2016 and $1.7 billion in 2015. cash and cash equivalents totaled $30.3 million as of december 31, 2016, compared with $23.9 million as of december 31, 2015.
•   in 2016, we issued $800 million of new long-term debt consisting of $500 million by eversource parent, $250 million by nstar electric, and $50 million by wmeco. in 2016, nstar electric repaid at maturity, $200 million of existing long-term debt.
•   in 2016, we paid cash dividends on common shares of $564.5 million, compared with $529.8 million in 2015. on february 2, 2017, our board of trustees approved a common share dividend of $0.475 per share, payable on march 31, 2017 to shareholders of record as of march 2, 2017. the 2017 dividend represents an increase of 6.7 percent over the dividend paid in december 2016, and is the equivalent to dividends on common shares of $602.1 million on an annual basis.
30
•   we project to make capital expenditures of approximately $9.6 billion from 2017 through 2020, of which we expect approximately $5.3 billion to be in our electric and natural gas distribution segments and approximately $3.9 billion to be in our electric transmission segment. we also project to invest approximately $0.4 billion in information technology and facilities upgrades and enhancements. these projections do not include any expected investments related to either access northeast or bay state wind.
strategic, legislative, regulatory, policy and other items:
•   on october 14, 2016, the nhpuc granted npt public utility status, conditional on final project permitting. on january 31, 2017, the new hampshire supreme court upheld a lower court's ruling that npt has the right to install underground transmission lines under existing public highway easements in new hampshire with approval of the new hampshire department of transportation.
•   bay state wind is a proposed off-shore wind project being jointly developed by eversource and denmark-based dong energy. bay state wind will be located in a 300-square-mile area approximately 15 to 25 miles south of martha's vineyard that has the ultimate potential to generate at least 2,000 mw of wind power energy.
•   on august 8, 2016, massachusetts legislation was enacted that requires edcs to jointly solicit rfps and enter into long-term contracts for offshore wind and clean energy, such as hydropower, land-based wind or solar, provided that reasonable proposals have been received. the rfp for clean energy, such as hydropower, is due to be released by april 1, 2017. the initial rfp for no less than 400 mw of off-shore wind is due to be released by june 30, 2017. northern pass and bay state wind, respectively, will be bid into these rfps.
•   eversource, spectra and national grid are currently evaluating a series of options surrounding the access northeast project as a result of recent state regulatory and judicial decisions in new england regarding edcs entering into long-term natural gas capacity contracts. these options include state infrastructure legislation changes and ldc contracts in order to help bring needed additional natural gas pipeline and storage capacity to new england. as a result, the final design, cost, and in-service date of access northeast will continue to be refined.

our electric distribution segment earnings decreased $44.3 million in 2016, as compared to 2015. the decrease was due primarily to the absence in 2016 of the resolution of nstar electric's basic service bad debt adder mechanism recorded in 2015 ($14.5 million), the absence in 2016 of the favorable impact associated with the nstar electric comprehensive settlement agreement recorded in 2015 ($13.0 million), and higher depreciation expense. in addition, earnings decreased due to higher operations and maintenance expense (primarily related to the absence of a $6.3 million regulatory benefit related to certain uncollectible hardship accounts receivable that was recorded in 2015 at nstar electric, as well as higher storm restoration costs, higher vegetation management costs and the write-off of software design costs), higher property tax expense, and lower non-decoupled retail electric sales volumes due primarily to increased customer energy conservation efforts. these unfavorable earnings impacts were partially offset by increased cl&p distribution revenues primarily as a result of higher rate base and the absence of a required roe reduction, as stipulated in the pura 2014 rate case decision, and higher generation earnings.
our electric transmission segment earnings increased $66.3 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to a higher transmission rate base as a result of increased investments in our transmission infrastructure, the ferc-allowed recovery of certain merger-related costs in 2016 ($16.5 million), and the absence in 2016 of reserve charges in 2015 associated with the ferc roe complaint proceedings ($12.4 million).
our natural gas distribution segment earnings increased $5.3 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to the impact of the nstar gas base distribution rate increase effective january 1, 2016, the higher return earned on the nstar gas system enhancement program ("gsep") capital tracker mechanism effective in 2016, and lower operations and maintenance expense. these favorable earnings impacts were partially offset by lower non-decoupled firm natural gas sales volumes driven by the warmer than normal weather in the first quarter of 2016, as compared to the much colder than normal weather in the first quarter of 2015, higher property tax expense, and higher interest expense.
eversource parent and other companies: eversource parent and other companies had earnings of $31.0 million in 2016, compared with a net loss of $5.5 million in 2015. the earnings increase was due primarily to lower income tax expense as a result of recognizing tax benefits from executive deferred compensation payments, which resulted from the adoption of a new accounting standard, and the absence in 2016 of integration costs, partially offset by higher interest expense.
electric and natural gas sales volumes: weather, fluctuations in energy supply costs, conservation measures (including utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs), and economic conditions affect customer energy usage. industrial sales volumes are less sensitive to temperature variations than residential and commercial sales volumes. in our service territories, weather impacts electric sales volumes during the summer and both electric and natural gas sales volumes during the winter; however, natural gas sales volumes are more sensitive to temperature variations than electric sales volumes. customer heating or cooling usage may not directly correlate with historical levels or with the level of degree-days that occur.
fluctuations in retail electric sales volumes at nstar electric and psnh impact earnings ("traditional" in the table below). for cl&p and wmeco, fluctuations in retail electric sales volumes do not impact earnings due to their respective regulatory commission approved distribution revenue decoupling mechanisms ("decoupled" in the table below). these distribution revenues are decoupled from their customer sales volumes, which breaks the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized. cl&p and wmeco reconcile their annual base distribution rate recovery amounts to their respective pre-established levels of baseline distribution delivery service revenues of $1.059 billion and $132.4 million, respectively. any difference between the allowed level of distribution revenue and the actual amount incurred during a 12-month period is adjusted through rates in the following period.
fluctuations in natural gas sales volumes in massachusetts do not impact earnings due to the dpu-approved natural gas distribution revenue decoupling mechanism approved in the last rate case decision ("decoupled" in the table below). natural gas distribution revenues are decoupled from their customer sales volumes, where applicable, which breaks the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized.

(1)   special contracts are unique to the natural gas distribution customers who take service under such an arrangement and generally specify the amount of distribution revenue to be paid to yankee gas regardless of the customers' usage.
for 2016, retail electric sales volumes at our electric utilities with a traditional rate structure (nstar electric and psnh) were lower, as compared to 2015, due primarily to lower customer usage driven by the impact of increased customer energy conservation efforts, including those resulting from company-sponsored energy efficiency programs.
on january 28, 2016, eversource received approval of a three-year energy efficiency plan in massachusetts, which includes recovery of lbr at nstar electric until it is operating under a decoupled rate structure. nstar electric earns lbr related to reductions in sales volume as a result of successful energy efficiency programs. lbr is recovered from retail customers through current rates. nstar electric recognized lbr of $60.7 million and $60.6 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
our firm natural gas sales volumes are subject to many of the same influences as our retail electric sales volumes. in addition, they have benefited from customer growth in both of our natural gas distribution companies. in 2016, our traditional firm natural gas sales volumes were lower, as compared to 2015. the 2016 traditional firm natural gas sales volumes were negatively impacted by warmer than normal weather in the first quarter of 2016, as compared to the much colder than normal temperatures in the first quarter of 2015, throughout our natural gas service territories. heating degree days for 2016 were five percent lower in connecticut, as compared to 2015.
liquidity consolidated: cash and cash equivalents totaled $30.3 million as of december 31, 2016, compared with $23.9 million as of december 31, 2015.
long-term debt issuances and repayments: in march 2016, eversource parent issued $250 million of 2.50 percent series i senior notes, due to mature in 2021, and $250 million of 3.35 percent series j senior notes, due to mature in 2026. the proceeds, net of issuance costs, were used to repay short-term borrowings under the eversource parent commercial paper program.
in may 2016, nstar electric repaid at maturity $200 million variable rate debentures using short-term borrowings. also in may 2016, nstar electric issued $250 million of 2.70 percent debentures, due to mature in 2026. the proceeds, net of issuance costs, were used to repay short-term borrowings under the nstar electric commercial paper program and fund capital expenditures and working capital.
in june 2016, wmeco issued $50 million of 2.75 percent series h senior notes, due to mature in 2026. the proceeds, net of issuance costs, were used to repay short-term borrowings.
debt issuance authorizations: on november 3, 2016, ferc authorized npt to issue up to an aggregate of $800 million in short-term and long-term debt through december 31, 2018. on january 4, 2017, pura approved cl&p's request for authorization to issue up to $1.325 billion in long-term debt through december 31, 2020.

commercial paper programs and credit agreements: eversource parent has a $1.45 billion commercial paper program allowing eversource parent to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, eversource parent had approximately $1.0 billion and approximately $1.1 billion, respectively, in short-term borrowings outstanding under the eversource parent commercial paper program, leaving $428.0 million and $351.5 million of available borrowing capacity as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 was 0.88 percent and 0.72 percent, respectively. as of december 31, 2016, there were intercompany loans from eversource parent of $80.1 million to cl&p, $160.9 million to psnh, and $51.0 million to wmeco. as of december 31, 2015, there were intercompany loans from eversource parent of $277.4 million to cl&p, $231.3 million to psnh and $143.4 million to wmeco. eversource parent, cl&p, psnh, wmeco, nstar gas and yankee gas are parties to a five-year $1.45 billion revolving credit facility. effective september 26, 2016, the revolving credit facility's termination date was extended for one additional year to september 4, 2021. the revolving credit facility serves to backstop eversource parent's $1.45 billion commercial paper program. there were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2016 or 2015.
nstar electric has a $450 million commercial paper program allowing nstar electric to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, nstar electric had $126.5 million and $62.5 million, respectively, in short-term borrowings outstanding under its commercial paper program, leaving $323.5 million and $387.5 million of available borrowing capacity as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 was 0.71 percent and 0.40 percent, respectively. nstar electric is a party to a five-year $450 million revolving credit facility. effective september 26, 2016, the revolving credit facility's termination date was extended for one additional year to september 4, 2021.  the revolving credit facility serves to backstop nstar electric's $450 million commercial paper program. there were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2016 or 2015.
cash flows: cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $2.2 billion in 2016, compared with $1.4 billion in 2015. the increase in operating cash flows was due primarily to the absence in 2016 of $302 million in payments made in 2015 by cl&p and wmeco to fully satisfy the obligation with the doe for costs associated with the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste at previously owned generation facilities. in addition, there was an increase of $226.0 million in regulatory recoveries, primarily at nstar electric, due to $98.1 million of collections from customers in excess of purchased power costs, the favorable impact associated with the december 2015 legislation that extended tax bonus depreciation, which resulted in a $145.8 million decrease in income tax payments in 2016, as compared to 2015, and an increase of $55.2 million of the yankee companies' doe damages and other proceeds received in 2016, as compared to 2015. partially offsetting these favorable impacts was the timing of collections and payments related to our working capital items.
in 2016, we paid cash dividends of $564.5 million, or $1.78 per common share, compared with $529.8 million, or $1.67 per common share in 2015. our quarterly common share dividend payment was $0.445 per share, in 2016, as compared to $0.4175 per common share in 2015. on february 2, 2017, our board of trustees approved a common share dividend of $0.475 per share, payable on march 31, 2017 to shareholders of record as of march 2, 2017. the 2017 dividend represents an increase of 6.7 percent over the dividend paid in december 2016, and is the equivalent to dividends on common shares of $602.1 million on an annual basis.
in 2016, cl&p, nstar electric, psnh, and wmeco paid $199.6 million, $278.3 million, $77.6 million, and $38.0 million, respectively, in common stock dividends to eversource parent.
investments in property, plant and equipment on the statements of cash flows do not include amounts incurred on capital projects but not yet paid, cost of removal, afudc related to equity funds, and the capitalized portions of pension expense. in 2016, investments for eversource, cl&p, nstar electric, psnh, and wmeco were $2.0 billion, $612.0 million, $524.3 million, $305.4 million, and $140.6 million, respectively.
each of eversource, cl&p, nstar electric, psnh and wmeco use its available capital resources to fund its respective construction expenditures, meet debt requirements, pay operating costs, including storm-related costs, pay dividends and fund other corporate obligations, such as pension contributions. eversource's regulated companies recover their electric and natural gas distribution construction expenditures as the related project costs are depreciated over the life of the assets. this impacts the timing of the revenue stream designed to fully recover the total investment plus a return on the equity and debt used to finance the investments. the current growth in eversource's construction expenditures utilizes a significant amount of cash for projects that have a long-term return on investment and recovery period, totaling approximately $2 billion in cash capital spend in 2016. in addition, new growth in eversource's key business initiatives in 2016 required cash contributions of approximately $190 million, which are recognized as long-term assets. these factors have resulted in current liabilities exceeding current assets by approximately $1.2 billion, $135.3 million, $409.2 million and $27.2 million at eversource, cl&p, nstar electric and wmeco, respectively, as of december 31, 2016.
as of december 31, 2016, a total of $745 million of eversource's long-term debt is classified as current liabilities, $250 million, $400 million, $70 million and $25 million for cl&p, nstar electric, psnh and nstar gas, respectively, and will be paid in the next 12 months. the remaining $28.9 million of eversource's long-term debt classified as current liabilities relates to fair value adjustments from the merger that will be amortized in the next 12 months and have no cash flow impact. eversource, with its strong credit ratings, has several options available in the financial markets to repay or refinance these maturities with the issuance of new long-term debt. eversource, cl&p, nstar electric, psnh and wmeco will reduce their short-term borrowings with operating cash flows or with the issuance of new long-term debt, determined by considering capital requirements and maintenance of eversource's credit rating and profile. we expect the future operating cash flows of eversource, cl&p, nstar electric, psnh and wmeco, along with the access to financial markets, will be sufficient to meet any future operating requirements and capital investment forecasted opportunities.

access northeast: access northeast is a natural gas pipeline and storage project being developed jointly by eversource, spectra energy partners, lp ("spectra") and national grid plc ("national grid"), through algonquin gas transmission, llc ("agt"). this project is expected to enhance the algonquin and maritimes & northeast pipeline systems using existing routes and is expected to include two new lng storage tanks and liquefaction and vaporization facilities in acushnet, massachusetts that are currently expected to be connected to the algonquin natural gas pipeline. access northeast is expected to be capable of delivering approximately 900 million cubic feet of additional natural gas per day to new england on peak demand days. eversource and spectra each own a 40 percent interest in the project, with the remaining 20 percent interest owned by national grid. the project is subject to ferc and other federal and state regulatory approvals. its initial proposed configuration was expected to cost $3 billion to construct, with eversource energy's investment share at $1.2 billion. as of december 31, 2016, we have invested $30.9 million in this project.
in 2015 and 2016, agt sought to secure long-term natural gas pipeline capacity contracts with edcs in massachusetts, connecticut, new hampshire, maine, and rhode island. subsequently, in massachusetts and new hampshire, it was ruled that state statutes precluded the state regulatory agencies from approving those contracts. for further information on the state and regulatory agency actions taken in the new england states over the course of 2016, see "regulatory developments and rate matters - general - new england natural gas pipeline capacity" in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
eversource, spectra and national grid are currently evaluating a series of options surrounding access northeast, including state infrastructure legislation changes and ldc contracts, in order to help bring needed additional natural gas pipeline and storage capacity to new england. as a result, the final design, cost, and in-service date of access northeast will continue to be refined.
bay state wind: bay state wind is a proposed off-shore wind project being jointly developed by eversource and denmark-based dong energy. bay state wind will be located in a 300-square-mile area approximately 15 to 25 miles south of martha's vineyard that has the ultimate potential to generate at least 2,000 mw of wind power energy. both eversource and dong energy have a 50 percent ownership interest in bay state wind. in august 2016, massachusetts passed clean energy legislation that requires edcs to jointly solicit rfps and enter into long-term contracts for off-shore wind, creating rfp opportunities for projects like bay state wind. the initial rfp for no less than 400 mw of off-shore wind is due to be released by june 30, 2017 and bay state wind will be bid into that rfp. for more information regarding the clean energy legislation, see "legislative and policy matters - massachusetts" in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

ghcc: the greater hartford central connecticut ("ghcc") solutions, which have been approved by iso-ne, consist of 27 projects with an expected investment of approximately $350 million that are expected to be placed in service through 2018. ten projects have been placed in service, and nine projects are in active construction. as of december 31, 2016, cl&p had capitalized $117.2 million in costs associated with ghcc.
northern pass:  northern pass is eversource's planned hvdc transmission line from the québec-new hampshire border to franklin, new hampshire and an associated alternating current radial transmission line between franklin and deerfield, new hampshire. northern pass will interconnect at the québec-new hampshire border with a planned hq hvdc transmission line. on july 21, 2015, the doe issued the draft environmental impact statement ("eis") for northern pass representing a key milestone in the permitting process. the doe completed the comment period on the draft eis on april 4, 2016, and is expected to issue the final eis in the third quarter of 2017.
on august 18, 2015, npt announced the forward nh plan, including a commitment to contribute $200 million to projects associated with economic development, tourism, community betterment and clean energy innovations to benefit the state of new hampshire. on june 28, 2016, psnh filed a power purchase agreement ("ppa") with the nhpuc. the ppa with hq, combined with the forward nh plan, is expected to deliver substantial energy cost savings and other benefits to new hampshire. the forward nh plan and the ppa are both commitments that are contingent upon the northern pass transmission line going into commercial operation.
on october 14, 2016, the nhpuc approved a settlement agreement between npt and the nhpuc staff and granted npt public utility status, conditional on final project permitting.
the society for the protection of new hampshire forests ("spnhf") filed a lawsuit against npt in november 2015 alleging that npt does not have the right to install underground transmission lines next to property the spnhf owns along public highways. on january 31, 2017, the new hampshire supreme court upheld a lower court's ruling that npt has the right to install underground transmission lines along and beneath public highways in new hampshire with approval of the new hampshire department of transportation.
the new hampshire site evaluation committee ("nh sec") is currently in the process of formal siting and is expected to issue an order on northern pass no later than september 30, 2017. the doe is expected to act on a presidential permit for northern pass after the final nh sec order is released and is expected to issue an approval before the end of 2017. northern pass is expected to be completed by the end of 2019.
in august 2016, massachusetts passed clean energy legislation that requires edcs to jointly solicit rfps and enter into long-term contracts for a large quantity of clean energy, such as hydropower. the solicitation is due to be released by april 1, 2017, and northern pass will be bid into that rfp. for more information regarding the clean energy legislation, see "legislative and policy matters - massachusetts" in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
greater boston reliability solution: in february 2015, iso-ne selected the greater boston and new hampshire solution ("the solution"), proposed by eversource and national grid, to satisfy the requirements identified in the greater boston study. the solution consists of a portfolio of electric transmission upgrades covering southern new hampshire and northern massachusetts in the merrimack valley and continuing into the greater boston metropolitan area, of which 28 are in eversource's service territory. the nh sec issued its written order approving the new hampshire upgrades on october 4, 2016. we are currently pursuing the necessary regulatory and siting application approvals in massachusetts. construction has also begun on several smaller projects not requiring siting approval. all upgrades are expected to be completed by the end of 2019. we estimate our portion of the investment in the solution will be approximately $560 million, of which approximately $134 million has been capitalized through december 31, 2016.
seacoast reliability project: on april 12, 2016, psnh filed a siting application with the nh sec for the seacoast reliability project, a 13-mile, 115kv transmission line within several new hampshire communities, which proposes to use a combination of overhead, underground and underwater line design to help meet the growing demand for electricity in the seacoast region. in june 2016, the nh sec accepted our application as complete and we expect the nh sec decision by mid-2017. this project is expected to be completed by the end of 2018. we estimate our investment in this project will be approximately $77 million, of which approximately $13 million has been capitalized through december 31, 2016.

ferc regulatory issues ferc roe complaints: four separate complaints have been filed at the ferc by combinations of new england state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, consumer advocates, consumer groups, municipal parties and other parties. each complaint challenges the netos' previous base roe of 11.14 percent or current base roe of 10.57 percent and seeks to reduce it both for the four separate 15-month complaint periods and prospectively.
the ferc ordered a 10.57 percent base roe for the first complaint period and prospectively from october 16, 2014, and that a utility's total or maximum roe for any incentive project shall not exceed the top of the new zone of reasonableness, which was set at 11.74 percent. we have refunded all amounts associated with the first complaint period. the netos and complainants have appealed the decision in the first complaint to the d.c. circuit court of appeals. a court decision is expected in 2017.
in 2015, the company recognized an after-tax charge to earnings (excluding interest) of $12.4 million, of which $7.9 million was recorded at cl&p, $1.4 million at nstar electric, $0.6 million at psnh, and $2.5 million at wmeco. the net aggregate after-tax charge to earnings (excluding interest) in 2014 totaled $22.4 million, of which $12.4 million was recorded at cl&p, $4.9 million at nstar electric, $1.7 million at psnh, and $3.4 million at wmeco.
on march 22, 2016, the ferc alj issued an initial decision on the second and third complaints. for the second complaint period, the ferc alj recommended a zone of reasonableness of 7.12 percent to 10.42 percent and a base roe of 9.59 percent. for the third complaint period, the ferc alj recommended a zone of reasonableness of 7.04 percent to 12.19 percent and a base roe of 10.90 percent. the ferc alj also found that the maximum roe for transmission incentive projects should be the top of the zone of reasonableness. the parties filed briefs on april 21, 2016 and may 11, 2016, in which they requested changes to the ferc alj's recommendations. the final ferc order will determine both the base roe and the maximum roe for transmission incentive projects for the two complaint periods.
we have not recorded any reserves to reflect the roes recommended in the ferc alj initial decision. we do not believe any roe outcome is more likely than the roes used to record our current reserves (a base roe of 10.57 percent and a maximum roe for transmission incentive projects of 11.74 percent). we are unable to predict the outcome of the final ferc order on the second and third complaints, and therefore, we believe that our current roes and reserves are appropriate at this time.
the impact of a 10 basis point change to a base roe of 10.57 percent would affect eversource's after-tax earnings by approximately $3 million for each of the historic 15-month second and third complaint periods.  if we adjusted our reserves based on the recommendations in the ferc alj initial decision (for both the base roe and maximum roe for transmission incentive projects), then it would result in an after-tax loss of approximately $34 million for the second complaint and an after-tax gain of approximately $8 million for the third complaint.
for the fourth complaint, filed april 29, 2016 and covering a 15-month period through july 30, 2017, certain municipal utilities claimed the current base roe of 10.57 percent and the incentive cap of 11.74 percent are unjust and unreasonable. the netos answered on june 3, 2016 and requested that ferc dismiss the complaint. on september 20, 2016, the ferc issued an order establishing hearing and settlement judge procedures. the case has been set for trial proceedings concurrently with settlement proceedings. trial is scheduled for august 2017, and a ferc alj initial decision could be received late in 2017. a final ferc order will determine both the base roe and the maximum roe for transmission incentive projects for the fourth complaint period and prospectively from the date the final ferc order is issued.
38
we cannot at this time predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding or the estimated impacts on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of eversource, cl&p, nstar electric, psnh and wmeco.
transmission merger cost recovery filing: on february 26, 2016, eversource filed an application seeking recovery of certain transmission related costs it incurred in consummating and transitioning the 2012 merger between northeast utilities and nstar. on november 22, 2016, eversource and other parties filed a settlement agreement with the ferc, which included the recovery through transmission rates of $27.5 million of costs over one year, beginning june 1, 2016. the ferc approved the settlement agreement on january 31, 2017. the $27.5 million was recognized in our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016.
ferc order no. 1000: on august 15, 2014, the d.c. circuit court of appeals upheld the ferc's authority to order major changes to transmission planning and cost allocation in ferc order no. 1000 and order no. 1000-a, including transmission planning for public policy needs, and the requirement that utilities remove from their transmission tariffs their rights of first refusal to build transmission, to allow for competition. iso-ne and the netos, including cl&p, nstar electric, psnh and wmeco made compliance filings to address this policy, which included exemption from competition for certain transmission solutions previously evaluated by iso-ne, and the netos' rights to retain use and control of existing right of ways. this compliance was accepted by the ferc on december 14, 2015. at the same time, the netos filed an appeal to the d.c. circuit court of appeals, challenging ferc's removal of the right of first refusal. state regulators have also filed an appeal, challenging the ferc's determination that iso-ne should select public policy transmission projects after a competitive process. oral arguments were heard by the court on january 13, 2017, and the court is expected to resolve the appeals in 2017.
nstar electric and wmeco merger ferc filings: on january 13, 2017, eversource made two filings with ferc related to the proposed merger of wmeco into nstar electric with an anticipated effective date of january 1, 2018. one filing requests ferc approval of the merger, and the other filing requests ferc approval of nstar electric's assumption of wmeco's short-term debt obligations. it is expected that ferc will act on these filings by mid-2017.
regulatory developments and rate matters general:
new england natural gas pipeline capacity: in late 2015 and early 2016, nstar electric, wmeco and national grid filed with the massachusetts dpu seeking approval of contracts with agt for natural gas pipeline capacity and storage. the dpu had determined in 2015 that it had authority to approve such contracts if they were found to be in the public interest. on august 17, 2016, the massachusetts supreme judicial court vacated the dpu's 2015 order, holding that the state's electric utility restructuring statutes precluded the dpu from approving contracts by edcs for natural gas capacity. the contracts were subsequently withdrawn from consideration by the dpu. in february 2016, psnh filed with the nhpuc a natural gas capacity contract with agt seeking regulatory approval. in october 2016, the nhpuc ruled that it did not have statutory authority to approve such contracts, despite a 2015 finding by nhpuc staff that the nhpuc had such authority. subsequently, both psnh and agt filed appeals of the nhpuc decision with the new hampshire supreme court and on february 15, 2017, the new hampshire supreme court agreed to hear the appeals.
in connecticut, in october 2016, the deep canceled the natural gas capacity rfp without prejudice following the massachusetts supreme judicial court decision. in rhode island, on january 13, 2017, national grid filed with state utility regulators, a notice to withdraw without prejudice its previously filed natural gas capacity contract with agt due to the uncertainty of edc contracting in massachusetts and new hampshire. in maine, the puc issued an order in september 2016 to move forward with the agt contract, contingent upon the participation by edcs in other new england states.
we continue to evaluate options on how to fulfill our need to bring additional natural gas transmission and storage capacity to new england. see "business development and capital expenditures - access northeast" in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information.
electric and natural gas base distribution rates:
each eversource utility subsidiary is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the state in which it operates: cl&p and yankee gas operate in connecticut and are subject to pura regulation; nstar electric, wmeco and nstar gas operate in massachusetts and are subject to dpu regulation; and psnh operates in new hampshire and is subject to nhpuc regulation. the regulated companies' distribution rates are set by their respective state regulatory commissions, and their tariffs include mechanisms for periodically adjusting their rates for the recovery of specific incurred costs.
in connecticut, state law requires regulated electric and natural gas utilities to file a distribution rate case, or for pura to initiate a rate review, within 4 years of the last rate case. cl&p distribution rates were established in a 2014 pura-approved rate case. management expects to file a cl&p rate case application with pura in the second quarter of 2017. yankee gas distribution rates were established in a 2011 pura-approved rate case. the requirement for yankee gas to file a base distribution rate case in 2015 was eliminated due to a rate review conducted by pura and a resulting settlement in 2015 between yankee gas and pura.
in massachusetts, electric distribution companies are required to file at least one distribution rate case every five years, and natural gas local distribution companies to file at least one distribution rate case every 10 years, and those companies are limited to one settlement agreement in any 10-year period. nstar electric and wmeco were subject to a base distribution rate freeze through december 31, 2015. nstar gas distribution rates were established in a 2015 dpu approved rate case.
39
in new hampshire, psnh distribution rates were established in a settlement approved by the nhpuc in 2010. prior to the expiration of that settlement, the nhpuc approved the continuation of those rates, and increased funding via rates, of psnh's reliability enhancement program. in accordance with the 2015 public service company of new hampshire restructuring and rate stabilization agreement, psnh agreed to not seek a general distribution rate increase effective before july 1, 2017.
electric and natural gas retail rates:
the eversource edcs obtain and resell power to retail customers who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier. the natural gas distribution companies procure natural gas for firm and seasonal customers. these energy supply procurement costs are recovered from customers in energy supply rates that are approved by the respective state regulatory commission. the rates are reset periodically and are fully reconciled to their costs. each electric and natural gas distribution company fully recovers its energy supply costs through approved regulatory rate mechanisms and, therefore, such costs have no impact on earnings.
the electric and natural gas distribution companies also recover certain other costs on a fully reconciling basis through regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms and, therefore, such costs have no impact on earnings. costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include energy efficiency program costs, electric transmission charges, electric federally mandated congestion charges, system resiliency costs, certain uncollectible hardship bad debt expenses, and restructuring and stranded costs resulting from deregulation. the reconciliation filings compare the total actual costs allowed to revenue requirements related to these services and the difference between the costs incurred (or the rate recovery allowed) and the actual costs allowed is deferred and included, to be either recovered or refunded, in future customer rates.
massachusetts:
distribution rates: on january 17, 2017, nstar electric and wmeco jointly filed an application (the "joint applicants") with the dpu for approval of a combined $96 million increase in base distribution rates, effective january 1, 2018. as part of this filing, the joint applicants are presenting a grid-wise performance plan, including the implementation of a performance-based rate-making mechanism in conjunction with a grid modernization base commitment of $400 million in incremental capital investment over a period of five years, commencing january 1, 2018. in addition, the joint applicants are proposing to streamline and align rate classifications between nstar electric and wmeco, and requesting a revenue decoupling rate mechanism for nstar electric. wmeco has a revenue decoupling mechanism in place. a final decision from the dpu is expected in late 2017, with new rates anticipated to be effective january 1, 2018.
nstar electric, wmeco and nstar gas energy efficiency plan: the massachusetts edcs and natural gas distribution companies have increased their energy efficiency savings achievements significantly since the enactment of the green communities act in 2008, with electric savings almost tripling between 2008 and 2014. on january 28, 2016, the dpu issued an order approving nstar electric's, wmeco's, and nstar gas' three-year electric and natural gas energy efficiency plan, which was jointly developed with other massachusetts edcs and natural gas distribution companies. as part of this plan, which covers the years 2016 through 2018, nstar electric, wmeco, and nstar gas will maintain aggressive savings goals. the plan includes the ability to earn performance incentives related to these aggressive savings goals totaling approximately $20 million annually over the three-year period for nstar electric, wmeco and nstar gas, as well as recovery of lbr estimated to be approximately $55 million annually for nstar electric until it is operating under a decoupled rate structure.
solar development: on december 29, 2016, the dpu approved the nstar electric and wmeco application to develop 35 mw and 27 mw, respectively, of solar generation facilities, in addition to wmeco's existing 8 mw of solar generation facilities. we expect development of the facilities to be completed by the end of 2017. we estimate our investment in these new facilities will be between approximately $180 million to $200 million. these solar generation facilities will be included in rates anticipated to be effective january 1, 2018.
july 2016 storm filing: on july 6, 2016, nstar electric filed with the dpu a final accounting of incremental, storm-related preparation and response costs totaling approximately $109 million for eight storms that occurred between 2012 through 2015. in the filing, nstar electric requested that the dpu investigate the storm-related costs and render a determination as to the final storm-related costs eligible for recovery. recovery of these costs will be reflected in the rates anticipated to be effective january 1, 2018, in accordance with the currently filed massachusetts distribution rate case.
october 2016 dpu storm order: on october 7, 2016, the dpu issued a final decision on wmeco's storm cost filing that sought to recover $27 million of storm restoration costs associated with the october 2011 snowstorm and storm sandy in 2012. the dpu approved essentially all of the costs, with the disallowed amounts and other items included in a filed motion for reconsideration.
40
new hampshire:
generation divestiture: on june 10, 2015, eversource and psnh entered into the 2015 public service company of new hampshire restructuring and rate stabilization agreement (the "agreement") with the new hampshire office of energy and planning, certain members of the nhpuc staff, the office of consumer advocate, two state senators, and several other parties. under the terms of the agreement, psnh agreed to divest its generation assets, subject to nhpuc approval. the agreement provided for a resolution of issues pertaining to psnh's generation assets in pending regulatory proceedings before the nhpuc. the agreement provided for the clean air project prudence proceeding to be resolved and all remaining clean air project costs to be included in rates effective january 1, 2016. as part of the agreement, psnh agreed to forego recovery of $25 million of the equity return related to the clean air project. in addition, psnh will not seek a general distribution rate increase effective before july 1, 2017 and will contribute $5 million to create a clean energy fund, which will not be recoverable from its customers. in 2015, psnh recorded the $5 million contribution as a long-term liability and an increase to operations and maintenance expense on the statements of income.
on july 1, 2016, the nhpuc approved the agreement in an order that, among other things, instructs psnh to begin the process to divest its generation assets. the nhpuc selected an auction adviser to assist with the divestiture, and a final plan and auction process was approved by the nhpuc in november 2016. in december 2016, certain intervenors asked the nhpuc to reconsider certain aspects of its divestiture plan; the nhpuc rejected that request on december 23, 2016. on january 10, 2017, these intervenors appealed the nhpuc's decision to the new hampshire supreme court, alleging procedural deficiencies, and complaining that the auction schedule and process were unreasonable. psnh and the new hampshire attorney general's office acting on behalf of the nhpuc requested the court to reject this appeal. on february 10, 2017, the new hampshire supreme court issued an order declining to accept the appeal. we continue to believe the assets will be sold by the end of 2017.
as of december 31, 2016, psnh's energy service rate base subject to divestiture, was approximately $625 million. this rate base will be reduced by the amount of the sales proceeds from the generation assets that are divested and sold. upon completion of the divestiture process, full recovery of psnh's generation assets is probable through a combination of cash flows during the remaining operating period, sales proceeds upon divestiture, and recovery of stranded costs via bonds that will be secured by a non-bypassable charge or through recoveries in future rates billed to psnh's customers.
legislative and policy matters federal: on december 18, 2015, the "protecting americans from tax hikes" act became law, which extended the accelerated deduction of depreciation to businesses from 2015 through 2019. this extended stimulus provided us with cash flow benefits of approximately $275 million (including approximately $105 million for cl&p) due to a refund of taxes paid in 2015 and lower tax payments in 2016 of approximately $300 million.
massachusetts on august 8, 2016, in conjunction with efforts to shape comprehensive energy legislation, "an act to promote energy diversity" (the "act") became law in massachusetts, which requires edcs to jointly solicit rfps and enter into 15- to 20-year contracts for at least 1,600 mw of offshore wind and up to an additional 9.45 terawatt hours of clean energy per year, such as hydropower, land-based wind or solar, provided that reasonable proposals have been received. the rfp for up to 9.45 terawatt hours of clean energy per year, such as hydropower, is due to be released by april 1, 2017. the initial rfp for no less than 400 mw of off-shore wind is due to be released by june 30, 2017. on december 27, 2016, the doer also determined, pursuant to the act, that it will establish targets for electric companies to deploy and/or procure viable and cost-effective energy storage solutions that will be adopted by july 1, 2017. for more information regarding projects that eversource will bid into the rfp processes, see "business development and capital expenditures - bay state wind and electric transmission business - northern pass" in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
on april 11, 2016, "an act relative to solar energy" became law, which raises the solar net metering cap levels by three percent for both private and public projects. among many items, the law allowed utilities to file proposals with the dpu by june 30, 2016 to build up to 35 mw of solar generation. nstar electric and wmeco filed an application with the dpu seeking approval to develop 35 mw and 27 mw, respectively, of solar generation facilities to be built in 2017. on december 29, 2016, the dpu approved the application. together, nstar electric and wmeco expect to invest up to $200 million in those facilities in 2017. see "regulatory developments and rate matters - massachusetts - solar generation" in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information.
new hampshire on may 2, 2016, "an act relative to net metering" became law, which raises the cap on net energy metering tariffs available to eligible customer generators from 50 mw to 100 mw and requires the nhpuc to initiate a proceeding to develop alternative net energy metering tariffs. we do not believe that this law will have a material financial impact on the company.

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates, assumptions and, at times, difficult, subjective or complex judgments. changes in these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. our management discusses with the audit committee of our board of trustees significant matters relating to critical accounting policies. our critical accounting policies are discussed below. see the combined notes to our financial statements for further information concerning the accounting policies, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements.
regulatory accounting: our regulated companies are subject to rate-regulation that is based on cost recovery and meets the criteria for application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated operations, which considers the effect of regulation on the timing of the recognition of certain revenues and expenses. the regulated companies' financial statements reflect the effects of the rate-making process.
the application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated enterprises results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities. regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates. regulatory assets are amortized as the incurred costs are recovered through customer rates. in some cases, we record regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission. we must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery. we base our conclusion on certain factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory precedent. regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or probable future refunds to customers.
we use our best judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities; however, regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs, and those conclusions could have a material impact on our financial statements. we believe it is probable that each of the regulated companies will recover the regulatory assets that have been recorded. if we determine that we can no longer apply the accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises to our operations, or that we cannot conclude it is probable that costs will be recovered from customers in future rates, the costs would be charged to earnings in the period in which the determination is made.
unbilled revenues: the determination of retail energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers is based on the reading of meters, which occurs regularly throughout the month. billed revenues are based on these meter readings, and the majority of our recorded annual revenues is based on actual billings. because customers are billed throughout the month based on pre-determined cycles rather than on a calendar month basis, an estimate of electricity or natural gas delivered to customers for which the customers have not yet been billed is calculated as of the balance sheet date.
unbilled revenues represent an estimate of electricity or natural gas delivered to customers but not yet billed. unbilled revenues are included in operating revenues on the statement of income and are assets on the balance sheet that are reclassified to accounts receivable in the following month as customers are billed. such estimates are subject to adjustment when actual meter readings become available or when there is a change in our estimates.
the regulated companies estimate unbilled sales volumes monthly by first allocating billed sales volumes to the current calendar month based on the daily load (for electric distribution companies) or the daily send-out (for natural gas distribution companies) for each billing cycle. the billed sales volumes are then subtracted from total month load or send-out, net of delivery losses, to estimate unbilled sales volumes. unbilled revenues are estimated by first allocating unbilled sales volumes to the respective customer classes, then applying an estimated rate by customer class to those sales volumes. the estimate of unbilled revenues can significantly impact the amount of revenues recorded at nstar electric, psnh and yankee gas because they do not have a revenue decoupling mechanism. cl&p, wmeco and nstar gas record a regulatory deferral to reflect the actual allowed amount of revenue associated with their respective decoupled distribution rate design.
pension and pbop: we sponsor pension and pbop plans to provide retirement benefits to our employees. for each of these plans, several significant assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation, funded status and net periodic benefit cost. these assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, compensation/progression rate and mortality and retirement assumptions. we evaluate these assumptions at least annually and adjust them as necessary. changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets: in developing this assumption, we consider historical and expected returns, as well as input from our consultants. our expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on assumptions regarding target asset allocations and corresponding expected rates of return for each asset class. we routinely review the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted asset allocations when appropriate. for the year ended december 31, 2016, our aggregate expected long-term rate-of-return assumption of 8.25 percent was used to determine our pension and pbop expense. for the forecasted 2017 pension and pbop expense, our expected long-term rate of return of 8.25 percent will be used reflecting our target asset allocations.
discount rate: payment obligations related to the pension and pbop plans are discounted at interest rates applicable to the expected timing of each plan's cash flows. the discount rate that was utilized in determining the 2016 pension and pbop obligations was based on a yield-curve approach. this approach utilizes a population of bonds with an average rating of aa based on bond ratings by moody's, s&p and fitch, and uses bonds with above median yields within that population. as of december 31, 2016, the discount rates used to determine the funded status were 4.33 percent for the pension plan and 4.21 percent for the pbop plan. as of december 31, 2015, the discount rates used were 4.6 percent for the pension plan and 4.62 percent for the pbop plan. the decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the funded status resulted in an increase on the pension and pbop plans' liability of approximately $177 million and $75 million, respectively, as of december 31, 2016.
42
effective january 1, 2016, we elected to transition the discount rate to the spot rate methodology from the yield-curve approach for the service and interest cost components of pension and pbop expense because it provides a more precise measurement by matching projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. historically, these components were estimated using the same weighted-average discount rate as for the funded status. the discount rates used to estimate the 2016 service costs were 4.89 percent and 4.09 percent for the pension and pbop plans, respectively. the discount rates used to estimate the 2016 interest costs were 3.80 percent and 2.88 percent for the pension and pbop plans, respectively. the total pre-tax benefit of this change on pension and pbop expense, prior to the capitalized portion and amounts deferred and recovered through rate reconciliation mechanisms, for the year ended december 31, 2016 resulted in decreases to pension and pbop costs of $46 million and $10 million, respectively. pension and pbop expense charged to earnings is net of the amounts capitalized.
mortality assumptions: assumptions as to mortality of the participants in our pension and pbop plans are a key estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant may receive over their lifetime and the corresponding plan liability we need to record. in 2016, a revised scale for the mortality table was released having the effect of decreasing the estimate of benefits to be provided to plan participants. the impact of the adoption of the new mortality scale resulted in a decrease of approximately $32 million and $11 million for the pension and pbop plans' liability, respectively, as of december 31, 2016.
compensation/progression rate: this assumption reflects the expected long-term salary growth rate, including consideration of the levels of increases built into collective bargaining agreements, and impacts the estimated benefits that pension plan participants receive in the future. as of both december 31, 2016 and 2015, the compensation/progression rate used to determine the funded status was 3.5 percent.
health care cost: in august 2016, we amended the pbop plan to standardize benefit design and make benefit changes. as a result, the plan is no longer subject to health care cost trends.
actuarial determination of expense: pension and pbop expense is determined by our actuaries and consists of service cost and prior service cost, interest cost based on the discounting of the obligations, and amortization of actuarial gains and losses, offset by the expected return on plan assets. actuarial gains and losses represent differences between assumptions and actual information or updated assumptions. pre-tax net periodic benefit expense for the pension plan (excluding the serp plans) was $62.4 million, $124.2 million and $118.4 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the pre-tax net periodic pbop cost is income of $17.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 and expense of $2.4 million and $8.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the assumed long-term rate of return to the pension and pbop plan asset balances. this calculated expected return is compared to the actual return or loss on plan assets at the end of each year to determine the investment gains or losses to be immediately reflected in unrecognized actuarial gains and losses.
forecasted expenses and expected contributions: we estimate that the expense for the pension plan (excluding the serp plans) will be approximately $54 million and income for the pbop plan will be approximately $38 million, respectively, in 2017. the periodic benefit cost for the pbop plan has been favorably impacted by the plan amendment which reduced the pbop liability. pension and pbop expense for subsequent years will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and other assumptions, and various other factors related to the populations participating in the plans.
our policy is to fund the pension plan annually in an amount at least equal to the amount that will satisfy all federal funding requirements. we contributed $146.2 million to the pension plan in 2016. we currently estimate contributing approximately $175 million to the pension plan in 2017.
for the pbop plan, it is our policy to fund the pbop plan annually through tax deductible contributions to external trusts. we contributed $12.5 million to the pbop plan in 2016. we currently estimate contributing $7.6 million to the pbop plan in 2017.
sensitivity analysis: the following represents the hypothetical increase to the pension plan's (excluding the serp plans) and pbop plan's reported annual cost as a result of a change in the following assumptions by 50 basis points:

higher compensation rate                                10.2                        12.4                   n/a         n/a goodwill: we have recorded approximately $3.5 billion of goodwill associated with previous mergers and acquisitions. we have identified our reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill as electric distribution, electric transmission and natural gas distribution. these reporting units are consistent with our operating segments underlying our reportable segments. electric distribution and electric transmission reporting units include carrying values for the respective components of cl&p, nstar electric, psnh and wmeco. the natural gas distribution reporting unit includes the carrying values of nstar gas and yankee gas. as of december 31, 2016, goodwill was allocated to the reporting units as follows: $2.5 billion to electric distribution, $0.6 billion to electric transmission, and $0.4 billion to natural gas distribution.
43
we are required to test goodwill balances for impairment at least annually by considering the fair values of the reporting units, which requires us to use estimates and judgments. we have selected october 1st of each year as the annual goodwill impairment testing date. goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value and if the implied fair value of goodwill based on the estimated fair values of the reporting units' assets and liabilities is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill. if goodwill were deemed to be impaired, it would be written down in the current period to the extent of the impairment.
we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of october 1, 2016 for the electric distribution, electric transmission and natural gas distribution reporting units. this evaluation required the consideration of several factors that impact the fair value of the reporting units, including conditions and assumptions that affect the future cash flows of the reporting units. key considerations include discount rates, utility sector market performance and merger transaction multiples, and internal estimates of future cash flows and net income.
the 2016 goodwill impairment test resulted in a conclusion that goodwill is not impaired and no reporting unit is at risk of a goodwill impairment.
income taxes: income tax expense is estimated for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and is recorded each quarter using an estimated annualized effective tax rate. this process to record income tax expense involves estimating current and deferred income tax expense or benefit and the impact of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial reporting and income tax return reporting purposes. such differences are the result of timing of the deduction for expenses, as well as any impact of permanent differences, non-tax deductible expenses, or other items that directly impact income tax expense as a result of regulatory activity (flow-through items). the temporary differences and flow-through items result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in the balance sheets.
we also account for uncertainty in income taxes, which applies to all income tax positions previously filed in a tax return and income tax positions expected to be taken in a future tax return that have been reflected on our balance sheets. the determination of whether a tax position meets the recognition threshold under applicable accounting guidance is based on facts and circumstances available to us. once a tax position meets the recognition threshold, the tax benefit is measured using a cumulative probability assessment. assigning probabilities in measuring a recognized tax position and evaluating new information or events in subsequent periods requires significant judgment and could change previous conclusions used to measure the tax position estimate. new information or events may include tax examinations or appeals (including information gained from those examinations), developments in case law, settlements of tax positions, changes in tax law and regulations, rulings by taxing authorities and statute of limitation expirations. such information or events may have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
accounting for environmental reserves: environmental reserves are accrued when assessments indicate it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. adjustments made to estimates of environmental liabilities could have an adverse impact on earnings. we estimate these liabilities based on findings through various phases of the assessment, considering the most likely action plan from a variety of available remediation options (ranging from no action required to full site remediation and long-term monitoring), current site information from our site assessments, remediation estimates from third party engineering and remediation contractors, and our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites. if a most likely action plan cannot yet be determined, we estimate the liability based on the low end of a range of possible action plans. a significant portion of our environmental sites and reserve amounts relate to former mgp sites that were operated several decades ago and manufactured gas from coal and other processes, which resulted in certain by-products remaining in the environment that may pose a potential risk to human health and the environment, for which we may have potential liability. as assessments on these sites are performed, we may receive new information to be considered in our estimates related to the extent and nature of the contamination and the costs of required remediation.
our estimates also incorporate currently enacted state and federal environmental laws and regulations and data released by the epa and other organizations. the estimates associated with each possible action plan are judgmental in nature partly because there are usually several different remediation options from which to choose. our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information from other sources, including the level of contamination at the site, the extent of our responsibility or the extent of remediation required, recently enacted laws and regulations or a change in cost estimates due to certain economic factors.
fair value measurements: we follow fair value measurement guidance that defines fair value as the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). we have applied this guidance to our company's derivative contracts that are not elected or designated as "normal purchases or normal sales" (normal), to marketable securities held in trusts, to our investments in our pension and pbop plans, and to nonfinancial assets such as goodwill and aros. this guidance was also applied in estimating the fair value of preferred stock and long-term debt.
changes in fair value of the regulated company derivative contracts are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities, as we recover the costs of these contracts in rates charged to customers. these valuations are sensitive to the prices of energy and energy-related products in future years for which markets have not yet developed and assumptions are made.
we use quoted market prices when available to determine the fair value of financial instruments. if quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments that are not active and model-derived valuations. when quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar instruments are not available, we value derivative contracts using models that incorporate both observable and unobservable inputs. significant unobservable inputs utilized in the models include energy and energy-related product prices for future years for long-dated derivative contracts and market volatilities. discounted cash flow valuations incorporate estimates of premiums or discounts, reflecting risk-adjusted profit that would be required by a market participant to arrive at an exit price, using available historical market transaction information. valuations of derivative contracts also reflect our estimates of nonperformance risk, including credit risk.

(b)   estimated interest payments on fixed-rate debt are calculated by multiplying the coupon rate on the debt by its scheduled notional amount outstanding for the period of measurement. estimated interest payments on floating-rate debt are calculated by multiplying the end of 2016 floating-rate reset on the debt by its scheduled notional amount outstanding for the period of measurement. this same rate is then assumed for the remaining life of the debt.
(c)   the capital lease obligations include interest.
(d)   amounts are not included on our balance sheets.

operating revenues, which primarily consist of base electric and natural gas distribution revenues and tracked revenues further described below, decreased by $315.7 million in 2016, as compared to 2015.
46
base electric and natural gas distribution revenues: base electric distribution segment revenues increased by $19.9 million due primarily to a higher rate base resulting from the 2015 pura adit settlement agreement that is being collected from customers in distribution rates at cl&p ($26.1 million) and the absence of a required roe reduction in 2015, as stipulated in the pura 2014 rate case decision, at cl&p ($4 million). this increase was partially offset by the absence of the benefit recognized in 2015 in operating revenues due to the pura adit settlement agreement. in addition, traditional electric base distribution revenues decreased $10.1 million due to a 1.7 percent decrease in non-decoupled retail electric sales volumes due primarily to increased customer energy conservation efforts, partly offset by psnh distribution rate increases effective july 1, 2015 and july 1, 2016.
contributing to the decrease in operating revenues in 2016 was the absence of an $11 million benefit related to the comprehensive settlement agreement associated with the recovery of lbr related to 2009 through 2011 energy efficiency programs recorded at nstar electric in 2015.
firm natural gas base distribution segment revenues increased $11.7 million due primarily to the impact of the nstar gas base distribution rate increase effective january 1, 2016, partially offset by a 4.8 percent decrease in traditional firm natural gas sales volumes as a result of warmer than normal weather experienced in the first quarter of 2016, as compared to much colder than normal temperatures in 2015.
fluctuations in cl&p's, wmeco's and nstar gas' sales volumes do not impact the level of base distribution revenue realized or earnings due to their respective regulatory commission approved revenue decoupling mechanisms. the revenue decoupling mechanisms permit recovery of a base amount of distribution revenues and break the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized. revenue decoupling mechanisms result in the recovery of our approved base distribution revenue requirements.
tracked distribution revenues: tracked revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in rates through regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore have no impact on earnings. costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include energy supply procurement costs and other energy-related costs for our electric and natural gas customers, retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, and restructuring and stranded cost recovery revenues. in addition, tracked revenues include certain incentives earned and carrying charges. tracked electric distribution segment revenues decreased as a result of decreases in energy supply costs ($625.2 million), driven by decreased average retail rates and lower sales volumes, partially offset by an increase in retail electric transmission charges ($84.6 million), an increase in federally mandated congestion charges ($103.0 million), an increase in energy efficiency program revenues ($51.7 million), an increase in stranded cost recovery charges ($39.2 million) and an increase in net metering for distributed generation revenues ($34.0 million). in addition, as a result of a change to the amounts collected in the system benefits charge, cl&p's calculated rate base increased, providing an increase to distribution revenues that positively impacted earnings by $23.2 million.
in 2016, tracked natural gas distribution segment revenues decreased as a result of decreases in natural gas supply costs ($128.2 million) driven by decreased average rates and lower sales volumes, and a decrease in energy efficiency program revenues ($22.7 million).
electric transmission revenues: the electric transmission segment revenues increased by $140.9 million due primarily to the recovery of higher revenue requirements associated with ongoing investments in our transmission infrastructure and the absence in 2016 of a $20 million reserve charge recorded in 2015 associated with the march 2015 ferc roe order.
other: other revenues decreased due primarily to the sale of eversource's unregulated contracting business on april 13, 2015 ($11.4 million).
purchased power, fuel and transmission expense includes costs associated with purchasing electricity and natural gas on behalf of our customers. these energy supply costs are recovered from customers in rates through cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on earnings (tracked costs). purchased power, fuel and transmission expense decreased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to the following:
(millions of dollars)                          (decrease)/increase electric distribution                          $(625.9           )

total purchased power, fuel and transmission   $(586.1           )
the decrease in purchased power expense at the electric distribution business was driven by lower prices associated with the procurement of energy supply, lower sales volumes, and a decrease in the amount of electricity generated by psnh facilities in 2016, as compared to 2015. the decrease in purchased power expense at the natural gas distribution business was due to lower sales volumes and lower average natural gas prices. the increase in transmission costs was primarily the result of an increase in costs billed by iso-ne that support regional grid investment.
47
operations and maintenance expense includes tracked costs and costs that are part of base electric and natural gas distribution rates with changes impacting earnings (non-tracked costs). operations and maintenance expense decreased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to the following:
(millions of dollars)                                                                                                           increase/(decrease)

depreciation expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher utility plant in service balances.
amortization of regulatory assets, net expense includes the deferral of energy supply and energy-related costs included in certain regulatory-approved tracking mechanisms and the amortization of certain costs. the deferral adjusts expense to match the corresponding revenues. amortization of regulatory assets, net increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to the deferral of energy supply and energy-related costs which can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and the related rate changes to recover these costs. energy supply and energy-related costs at cl&p, nstar electric, psnh and wmeco, which are the primary drivers in amortization, are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings. the increase in amortization of regulatory assets, net for the year ended december 31, 2016 also includes the absence in 2016 of the $11.7 million benefit recorded in 2015 at nstar electric in connection with the comprehensive settlement agreement.
energy efficiency programs expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to deferral adjustments at nstar electric, partially offset by deferral adjustments for the natural gas businesses, which reflect the actual costs of energy efficiency programs compared to the estimated amounts billed to customers, and the timing of the recovery of energy efficiency costs incurred in accordance with the three-year program guidelines established by the dpu. the deferrals adjust expense to match the energy efficiency programs revenue. the costs for various state energy policy initiatives and expanded energy efficiency programs are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.
taxes other than income taxes expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of higher utility plant balances and an increase in gross earnings taxes. gross earnings taxes are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.
interest expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to an increase in interest on long-term debt ($33.8 million) as a result of new debt issuances and an increase in interest on notes payable ($2.2 million), partially offset by a decrease in regulatory deferrals which decreased interest expense ($5.5 million).
other income, net increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher equity afudc amounts ($7.4 million), higher gains related to the sales of unregulated businesses ($9.4 million) and an increase in interest income ($4.1 million). partially offsetting these favorable impacts were the market value changes related to deferred compensation plans ($9.6 million).
48
income tax expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($24.2 million), higher state taxes ($7.5 million), and the sale of an unregulated business ($10.2 million), partially offset by the excess tax benefit due to the adoption of new accounting guidance related to share based payment transactions ($19.1 million), the true-up of the return to provision impacts and a higher tax benefit from a reduction in tax reserves ($7.6 million), and items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) and permanent differences ($0.2 million).

operating revenues, which primarily consist of base electric and natural gas distribution revenues and tracked revenues further described below, increased by $212.9 million in the aggregate in 2015 compared to 2014.
base electric and natural gas distribution revenues: base electric distribution segment revenues increased $150.9 million due primarily to cl&p's base distribution rate increase, effective december 1, 2014 ($136.3 million) and higher retail sales volumes driven by weather impacts at our non-decoupled operating companies (traditional). in addition, operating revenues increased $19.9 million at cl&p due to the pura-approved settlement agreement regarding adit, $11 million for the comprehensive settlement agreement associated with the recovery of lbr related to 2009 through 2011 energy efficiency programs at nstar electric, and $20.7 million increase of 2015 lbr recognition at nstar electric compared to 2014 lbr amounts. the $19.9 million represents cl&p's revenue requirement from the settlement agreement's rate increase through december 31, 2015, and is being collected from customers in rates over a 24-month period beginning december 1, 2015. the impact of colder winter weather experienced in the first quarter of 2015 and warmer weather in the third quarter of 2015, partially offset by milder winter weather in the fourth quarter of 2015, all as compared to the same periods in 2014, were the primary drivers of the increase in 2015 retail electric sales volumes of 0.6 percent and base electric distribution revenues at nstar electric and psnh.
50
for cl&p (effective december 1, 2014) and wmeco, fluctuations in retail electric sales volumes do not impact earnings due to their respective regulatory commission approved revenue decoupling mechanisms. the revenue decoupling mechanisms permit recovery of a base amount of distribution revenues and break the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized. revenue decoupling mechanisms result in the recovery of our approved base distribution revenue requirements. therefore, changes in sales volumes had no impact on the level of base distribution revenue realized at our decoupled companies.
firm natural gas base distribution segment revenues decreased $4.9 million due primarily to a 1.1 percent decrease in firm natural gas sales volumes in 2015, as compared to 2014. this was due to record warm weather in the fourth quarter of 2015 when compared to 2014, partially offset by colder winter weather in the first quarter of 2015 compared to 2014. weather-normalized firm natural gas sales volumes (based on 30-year average temperatures) increased 2.5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, due primarily to improved economic conditions as well as residential and commercial customer growth, partially offset by the impact of customer conservation efforts resulting from company-sponsored energy efficiency programs.
tracked distribution revenues: tracked revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in rates through regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore have no impact on earnings. costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include energy supply procurement costs and other energy-related costs for our electric and natural gas customers, retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, and restructuring and stranded cost recovery revenues. tracked electric distribution segment revenues increased primarily as a result of increases in energy supply costs ($176.4 million), driven by increased average retail rates, and increases in energy efficiency program revenues ($18.3 million). these increases were partially offset by a decrease in retail electric transmission charges ($77.5 million) and a decrease in the federally mandated congestion charge primarily driven by refunds in 2015 for a prior year overrecovery ($103.9 million). tracked natural gas supply revenues decreased $20.1 million as a result of a decrease in average rates related to the recovery of natural gas supply costs.
electric transmission revenues: the electric transmission segment revenues increased by $50.9 million primarily as a result of lower reserves associated with the ferc roe complaint proceedings in 2015 compared to 2014 and higher revenue requirements associated with ongoing investments in our transmission infrastructure.
other: other revenues decreased due primarily to the sale of eversource's unregulated contracting business on april 13, 2015 ($55 million).
purchased power, fuel and transmission expense includes costs associated with purchasing electricity and natural gas on behalf of our customers. these energy supply costs are recovered from customers in rates through reconciling cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on earnings (tracked costs). purchased power, fuel and transmission increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to the following:
(millions of dollars)                               increase/(decrease)
electric distribution                                    $74.8

total purchased power, fuel and transmission             $65.3
the increase in purchased power costs at the electric distribution business was driven by higher prices associated with the procurement of energy supply in 2015, as compared to 2014. the decrease in purchased power costs at the natural gas distribution business was due to lower average natural gas prices in 2015, as compared to 2014.
51
operations and maintenance expense includes tracked costs and costs that are part of base electric and natural gas distribution rates with changes impacting earnings (non-tracked costs). operations and maintenance decreased in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to the following:
(millions of dollars)                                                                                           increase/(decrease)

depreciation increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to higher utility plant in service balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service and an increase in depreciation rates at cl&p as a result of the distribution rate case effective december 1, 2014.
amortization of regulatory assets, net, which are tracked costs, include certain regulatory-approved tracking mechanisms. fluctuations in these costs are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings. amortization of regulatory assets, net, increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to the following:
(millions of dollars)                                                                                                                                increase/(decrease)

total amortization of regulatory assets, net                                                                                                              $11.6
the increase in cl&p's amortization was due primarily to an increase in storm cost recovery, which was approved and included in distribution rates effective december 1, 2014. in connection with the comprehensive settlement agreement associated with the cpsl program filings, nstar electric recognized an $11.7 million benefit in the first quarter of 2015, which was recorded as a reduction to amortization expense.
the remaining fluctuations in amortization expense are driven by the deferral of energy supply and energy-related costs, which can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and related rate changes to recover these costs. fluctuations in energy supply and energy-related costs, which are the primary drivers in amortization, are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.
energy efficiency programs, which are tracked costs, increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to an increase in energy efficiency costs in accordance with the three-year program guidelines established by the dpu at nstar electric.
taxes other than income taxes increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of both an increase in utility plant balances and property tax rates.
interest expense increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to an increase in interest on long-term debt ($9.3 million) as a result of new debt issuances in 2015 and an increase in interest on notes payable ($1.9 million).
other income, net increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to higher equity afudc amounts ($5.1 million) and an increase in interest income related to the deferred compensation plans ($4.3 million), partially offset by the absence in 2015 of a gain on the sale of land recorded in 2014 at cl&p ($4.5 million).
52
income tax expense increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($45.7 million), higher state taxes, the impact of adjusting our estimated tax expense to what was filed on our tax return (provision to return), the lower tax benefit in 2015 compared to 2014 from a change in tax reserves ($19.8 million), and higher items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) ($6.2 million).
earnings summary regulated companies: excluding integration costs, our electric distribution segment earnings increased $45.5 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to the impact of the december 1, 2014 cl&p base distribution rate increase, the $27.5 million favorable earnings impact related to the resolution of nstar electric's basic service bad debt adder and the settlement with the massachusetts attorney general on eleven open dockets covering the cpsl program filings and the recovery of lbr related to 2009 through 2011 energy efficiency programs at nstar electric, an increase in the recovery of lbr at nstar electric related to 2015 energy efficiency programs, and higher retail sales volumes at nstar electric and psnh. partially offsetting these favorable earnings impacts were a higher effective tax rate in 2015, higher property taxes, higher depreciation expense and a $5 million contribution in 2015 to create a clean energy fund in connection with the psnh divestiture agreement.
our electric transmission segment earnings increased $9.1 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to the result of lower reserve charges associated with the ferc roe complaint proceedings of $12.4 million recorded in 2015, as compared to $22.4 million recorded in 2014, and a higher transmission rate base as a result of an increased investment in our transmission infrastructure. these favorable earnings impacts were partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in 2015.
our natural gas distribution segment earnings increased $0.1 million in 2015, as compared to 2014. our natural gas distribution segment earnings were favorably impacted by a decrease in operations and maintenance costs primarily attributable to lower employee-related expenses, a lower effective tax rate in 2015, and additional natural gas heating customers. these favorable earnings impacts were offset by a decrease in firm natural gas sales volumes driven by record warm weather in the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to 2014, higher depreciation expense and higher property taxes.
eversource parent and other companies: excluding the impact of integration costs, eversource parent and other companies had earnings of $9.5 million in 2015, compared with earnings of $11.5 million in 2014. the earnings decrease was due primarily to a higher effective tax rate at eversource parent in 2015, as compared to 2014, higher interest expense at eversource parent as a result of new debt issuances in january 2015, and reduced earnings in 2015 from eversource's unregulated electrical contracting business, which was sold in april 2015. these unfavorable earnings impacts were partially offset by a reduction in operations and maintenance costs.
liquidity cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $1.4 billion in 2015, compared with $1.6 billion in 2014. the decrease in operating cash flows in 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to the $302 million payment made to fully satisfy the obligation with the doe, as discussed below, and an increase in purchased power and congestion costs at nstar electric, wmeco and cl&p that will be recovered in future periods. also contributing to the decrease in operating cash flows were doe damages proceeds received from the yankee companies of $4.7 million in 2015, compared to $132 million in 2014. partially offsetting these unfavorable cash flow impacts were a decrease of $49.2 million in pension and pbop plan cash contributions in 2015, as compared to 2014, and lower federal income tax payments of approximately $324 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to the extension of the accelerated depreciation deduction.
in late 2015, cl&p and wmeco made payments of $244.6 million and $57.4 million, respectively, to fully satisfy their obligations with the doe, which were classified as long-term debt on the balance sheets as of december 31, 2014, for costs associated with the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste for all periods prior to 1983 from their previous ownership interest in the millstone nuclear power station. cl&p and wmeco divested their ownership interest in millstone in 2001. these payments included accumulated interest of $178 million and $41.8 million for cl&p and wmeco, respectively. cl&p funded its payment with the issuance of debt, and wmeco liquidated its spent nuclear fuel trust to satisfy its obligation with the doe.
on december 18, 2015, the "protecting americans from tax hikes" act became law, which extended the accelerated deduction of depreciation to businesses from 2015 through 2019. this extended stimulus provided us with cash flow benefits in 2016 of approximately $275 million (including approximately $105 million for cl&p) due to a refund of taxes paid in 2015 and lower tax payments in 2016 of approximately $300 million.

cl&p's operating revenues, which consist of base distribution revenues and tracked revenues further described below, increased by $3.3 million in 2016, as compared to 2015.
base distribution revenues increased by $30.1 million due to a higher rate base resulting from the 2015 pura adit settlement agreement that is being collected from customers in distribution rates ($26.1 million) and the absence of a required roe reduction, as stipulated in the pura 2014 rate case decision, recorded in 2015 ($4 million). this increase was partially offset by the absence of the benefit recognized in 2015 in operating revenues due to the pura adit settlement agreement.
fluctuations in cl&p's sales volumes do not impact the level of base distribution revenue realized or earnings due to the pura approved revenue decoupling mechanism. cl&p's revenue decoupling mechanism permits recovery of a base amount of distribution revenues ($1.059 billion annually) and breaks the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized. the revenue decoupling mechanism results in the recovery of approved base distribution revenue requirements.
fluctuations in the overall level of operating revenues are primarily related to tracked revenues. tracked revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in rates through pura-approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore have no impact on earnings. costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include energy supply procurement and other energy-related costs, retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs and restructuring and stranded cost recovery revenues. in addition, tracked revenues include certain incentives earned and carrying charges. tracked distribution revenues decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in energy supply costs ($222.4 million) driven by decreased average retail rates and lower sales volumes. partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in federally mandated congestion charges ($103.0 million) and an increase in competitive transition assessment charges ($31.7 million). in addition, as a result of a change to the amounts collected in the system benefits charge, cl&p's calculated rate base increased, providing an increase to distribution revenues that impacted earnings of $23.2 million.
transmission revenues increased by $62.7 million due primarily to higher revenue requirements associated with ongoing investments in our transmission infrastructure and the absence in 2016 of a $12.5 million reserve charge recorded in 2015 associated with the march 2015 ferc roe order.

purchased power and transmission expense includes costs associated with purchasing electricity on behalf of cl&p's customers. these energy supply costs are recovered from customers in pura-approved cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on earnings (tracked costs). purchased power and transmission expense decreased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to the following:
(millions of dollars)                    (decrease)/increase purchased power costs                    $(173.1           )
transmission costs                       38.5
total purchased power and transmission   $(134.6           )
included in purchased power costs are the costs associated with cl&p's gsc and deferred energy supply costs. the gsc recovers energy-related costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers who have not migrated to third party suppliers. the decrease in purchased power costs in 2016, compared to 2015, was due primarily to a decrease in the price of standard offer supply, as well as lower sales volumes. the increase in transmission costs was primarily the result of an increase in costs billed by iso-ne that support regional grid investment.
operations and maintenance expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, driven by a $9.2 million increase in tracked costs, which have no earnings impact, that was primarily attributable to higher transmission expenses, partially offset by a $6.4 million decrease in non-tracked costs, which was primarily attributable to lower employee-related expenses, partially offset by higher storm restoration costs and the write-off of software design costs.
depreciation increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher utility plant in service balances.
amortization of regulatory assets, net expense includes the deferral of energy supply and energy-related costs and the amortization of storm and other costs. amortization of regulatory assets, net increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to the deferral adjustment of energy supply and energy-related costs, which can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and related rate changes to recover these costs. the deferral adjusts expense to match the corresponding revenues. energy supply and energy-related costs, which are the primary drivers of amortization, are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.
taxes other than income taxes expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of both an increase in utility plant balances and an increase in gross earnings taxes. gross earnings taxes are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.
interest expense decreased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to lower deferred regulatory interest expense ($5.0 million) and a decrease in interest expense related to deposits ($1.3 million), partially offset by an increase in interest on long-term debt ($5.1 million).
income tax expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($23.2 million), higher state taxes ($1.5 million), and items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) and permanent differences ($7.7 million), partially offset by the excess tax benefit due to the adoption of new accounting guidance related to share-based payment transactions ($0.9 million), and the true-up of the return to provision impacts and a lower tax benefit from a reduction in tax reserves ($0.5 million).
earnings summary cl&p's earnings increased $34.9 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to an increase in transmission earnings driven by a higher transmission rate base, as well as the absence in 2016 of the 2015 ferc roe complaint proceedings reserve charge, higher distribution revenues as a result of higher rate base and the absence of a required roe reduction, as stipulated in the pura 2014 rate case decision, and lower operations and maintenance expense. these favorable earnings impacts were partially offset by higher property and other tax expense, a higher effective tax rate and higher depreciation expense.
liquidity cash totaled $6.6 million as of december 31, 2016, compared with $1.1 million as of december 31, 2015.
eversource parent has a $1.45 billion commercial paper program allowing eversource parent to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt, with intercompany loans to certain subsidiaries, including cl&p. the weighted-average interest rate on the commercial paper borrowings as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 was 0.88 percent and 0.72 percent, respectively. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, there were intercompany loans from eversource parent to cl&p of $80.1 million and $277.4 million, respectively.
eversource parent, and certain of its subsidiaries, including cl&p, are parties to a five-year $1.45 billion revolving credit facility. effective september 26, 2016, the revolving credit facility's termination date was extended for one additional year to september 4, 2021. there were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2016 or 2015.
55
in 2016, cl&p had cash flows provided by operating activities of $811.5 million, compared with $298.3 million in 2015. the increase in operating cash flows was due primarily to the absence in 2016 of approximately $244.6 million in payments made in 2015 to fully satisfy the pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel obligation with the doe, and the favorable impact associated with the december 2015 legislation that extended tax bonus depreciation, which resulted in income tax refunds of $73.9 million received in 2016, as compared to income tax payments of $55.2 million made in 2015. also contributing to the favorable impact was an increase in distribution rates due to higher rate base and the timing of collections and payments related to our working capital items, including accounts receivable and accounts payable. partially offsetting these impacts was the timing of regulatory recoveries primarily related to energy efficiency program costs.
investments in property, plant and equipment on the statements of cash flows do not include amounts incurred on capital projects but not yet paid, cost of removal, afudc related to equity funds, and the capitalized portions of pension expense. cl&p's investments totaled $612.0 million in 2016, compared with $523.8 million in 2015.
financing activities in 2016 included $199.6 million in common stock dividends paid to eversource parent.

operating revenues cl&p's retail sales volumes were as follows:
for the years ended december 31,
2015                                        2014                    increase           percent retail sales volumes in gwh   22,071             22,046        25                 0.1        %
operating revenues cl&p's operating revenues, which consist of base distribution revenues and tracked revenues further described below, increased by $110.1 million in the aggregate in 2015 compared to 2014.
base distribution revenues: base distribution revenues increased $136.3 million due to a base distribution rate increase effective december 1, 2014. in addition, cl&p recognized $19.9 million in operating revenues due to the pura-approved settlement agreement regarding adit. the $19.9 million represents the revenue requirement from the settlement agreement's rate increase through december 31, 2015, and is being collected from customers in rates over a 24-month period beginning december 1, 2015.
effective december 1, 2014, cl&p's distribution revenues were decoupled from its sales volumes. as a result, cl&p no longer earns lbr related to its energy efficiency programs. the revenue decoupling mechanism permits recovery of a base amount of distribution revenues ($1.059 billion annually effective december 1, 2014) and breaks the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized. revenue decoupling mechanisms result in the recovery of our approved base distribution revenue requirements. therefore, changes in sales volumes had no impact on the level of base distribution revenue realized in 2015 and prospectively.
tracked revenues: tracked revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in rates through pura-approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore have no impact on earnings. costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include energy supply procurement and other energy-related costs, retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs and restructuring and stranded cost recovery revenues. tracked distribution revenues decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in the federally mandated congestion charge primarily driven by refunds in 2015 for a prior year overrecovery ($103.9 million) and a decrease in competitive transition assessment charges ($17 million), partially offset by an increase in energy supply costs ($51.1 million) driven by increased average retail rates, and an increase in retail transmission charges ($22.7 million).
transmission revenues increased $5.8 million due primarily to the result of lower reserves associated with the ferc roe complaint proceedings recorded in 2015 as compared to 2014, and higher revenue requirements associated with ongoing investments in our transmission infrastructure.

purchased power and transmission expense includes costs associated with purchasing electricity on behalf of cl&p's customers. these energy supply costs are recovered from customers in pura-approved cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on earnings (tracked costs). purchased power and transmission increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to the following:
(millions of dollars)                         increase/(decrease)
purchased power costs                              $54.6
transmission costs                                  17.8
other                                               (1.0        )
total purchased power and transmission             $71.4
included in purchased power are the costs associated with cl&p's gsc and deferred energy supply costs. the gsc recovers energy-related costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers that have not migrated to third party suppliers. the increase in purchased power was due primarily to higher prices associated with the procurement of energy supply related to standard offer from third party suppliers. the increase in transmission costs was primarily the result of higher local network service (lns) expenses, which are included in the retail transmission cost deferral.
operations and maintenance expense includes tracked costs and costs that are part of base distribution rates with changes impacting earnings (non-tracked costs). operations and maintenance decreased in 2015, as compared to 2014, driven by an $11.1 million decrease in non-tracked costs, which was primarily attributable to lower employee-related expenses, partially offset by higher bad debt expense. tracked costs, which have no earnings impact, increased $3.8 million, which was primarily attributable to higher tracked bad debt expense, partially offset by lower employee-related expenses.
depreciation increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to an increase in depreciation rates as a result of the distribution rate case decision that was effective december 1, 2014 and higher utility plant in service balances.
amortization of regulatory assets, net decreased in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to a decrease in the deferral of energy supply and energy-related costs that can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and related rate changes to recover these costs ($108 million decrease in 2015 compared to 2014), partially offset by an increase in storm cost recovery and other cost recovery approved and included in distribution rates effective december 1, 2014 ($61 million increase in 2015 compared to 2014). fluctuations in energy supply and energy-related costs, which are the primary drivers in amortization, are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.
energy efficiency programs, which are tracked costs, decreased in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to a decrease in the deferral, which reflects the actual costs of energy efficiency programs compared to estimated amounts billed to customers. cl&p is allowed to recover its costs for various state energy policy initiatives and expanded energy efficiency programs.
taxes other than income taxes increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of both an increase in utility plant balances and property tax rates.
other income, net decreased in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to the absence in 2015 of a gain on the sale of land recorded in 2014 ($4.5 million), partially offset by higher equity afudc amounts ($2.3 million).
income tax expense increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($19.4 million), higher state income taxes, the impact of adjusting estimated tax expense to what was filed on our tax return (provision to return), the lower tax benefit in 2015 compared to 2014 from a change in tax reserves ($17.3 million), and higher items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) ($7.2 million).
earnings summary cl&p's earnings increased $11.6 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, driven by higher distribution revenues due primarily to the impact of the december 1, 2014 base distribution rate increase and the pura-approved settlement agreement. in addition, earnings increased due to lower operations and maintenance costs, which were primarily attributable to lower employee-related expenses, and lower reserves associated with the ferc roe complaint proceedings recorded in 2015 compared to 2014. these favorable earnings impacts were partially offset by higher income tax expense as a result of lower tax benefits available for utilization in 2015, higher property taxes and the absence of a gain on the sale of land recorded in 2014.
58
liquidity in 2015, cl&p had cash flows provided by operating activities of $298.3 million, compared with $612.4 million in 2014. the decrease in operating cash flows was due primarily to the approximate $245 million in payments made to fully satisfy the pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel obligation with the doe. also contributing to the decrease in operating cash flows were doe damages proceeds received from the yankee companies of $2.3 million in 2015, compared to $68.6 million in 2014.
in late 2015, cl&p made a payment of $244.6 million to fully satisfy its obligation with the doe, which was classified as long-term debt on the balance sheet as of december 31, 2014, for costs associated with the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste for all periods prior to 1983 from its previous ownership interest in the millstone nuclear power station. cl&p divested its ownership interest in millstone in 2001. this payment included accumulated interest of $178 million. cl&p funded its payment with the issuance of debt.
on december 18, 2015, the "protecting americans from tax hikes" act became law, which extended the accelerated deduction of depreciation to businesses from 2015 through 2019. this extended stimulus provided cl&p with cash flow benefits in 2016 of approximately $105 million due to a refund of taxes paid in 2015 and lower tax payments in 2016.
investments in property, plant and equipment on the statements of cash flows do not include amounts incurred on capital projects but not yet paid, cost of removal, afudc related to equity funds, and the capitalized portions of pension expense. cl&p's investments totaled $523.8 million in 2015, compared with $515.7 million in 2014.
on october 26, 2015, eversource parent and certain of its subsidiaries, including cl&p, amended and restated their joint $1.45 billion revolving credit facility and the termination date was extended to september 4, 2020. the revolving credit facility serves to backstop eversource parent's $1.45 billion commercial paper program. the commercial paper program allows es parent to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt with intercompany loans to certain subsidiaries, including cl&p. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, there were intercompany loans from eversource parent of $277.4 million and $133.4 million, respectively, to cl&p.
on may 20, 2015 and december 1, 2015, cl&p issued $300 million and $50 million, respectively, of 4.15 percent 2015 series a first and refunding mortgage bonds due to mature in 2045. the proceeds, net of issuance costs, were used to repay short-term borrowings.
on april 1, 2015, cl&p repaid at maturity the $100 million 5.00 percent 2005 series a first and refunding mortgage bonds using short-term borrowings and also redeemed the $62 million 1996a series 1.55 percent pcrbs that were subject to mandatory tender, using short term borrowings.
financing activities in 2015 included $196 million in common stock dividends paid to eversource parent.

operating revenues nstar electric's retail sales volumes were as follows:
for the years ended december 31,
2016                                        2015                    decrease           percent retail sales volumes in gwh   20,619             21,055             (436   )           (2.1   )%
nstar electric's operating revenues, which consist of base distribution revenues and tracked revenues further described below, decreased by $123.4 million in 2016, as compared to 2015.
base distribution revenues: base distribution revenues, excluding lbr, decreased $13.4 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, driven by a 2.1 percent decrease in sales volumes due primarily to increased customer energy conservation efforts, including those resulting from company-sponsored energy efficiency programs. nstar electric is allowed to recover lbr related to reductions in sales volumes as a result of successful energy efficiency programs.
also contributing to the decrease in operating revenues in 2016 was the absence of an $11 million benefit recorded in 2015 related to the comprehensive settlement agreement associated with the recovery of lbr related to 2009 through 2011 energy efficiency programs.
tracked revenues: tracked revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in rates through dpu-approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore have no impact on earnings. costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include energy supply costs, retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, net metering for distributed generation and transition cost recovery revenues. in addition, tracked revenues include certain incentives earned and carrying charges. tracked distribution revenues decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in energy supply costs ($332.4 million) driven by decreased average retail rates and lower sales volumes. partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in retail transmission charges ($67.9 million), an increase in cost recovery related to energy efficiency programs ($53.2 million), an increase in net metering revenues ($30.2 million) and an increase in transition cost recovery revenues ($20 million).
transmission revenues increased by $38.7 million due primarily to the recovery of higher revenue requirements associated with ongoing investments in our transmission infrastructure and the absence in 2016 of a $2.4 million reserve charge recorded in 2015 associated with the march 2015 ferc roe order.
purchased power and transmission expense includes costs associated with purchasing electricity on behalf of nstar electric's customers. these energy supply costs are recovered from customers in dpu-approved cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on earnings (tracked costs). purchased power and transmission expense decreased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to the following:
(millions of dollars)                    (decrease)/increase purchased power costs                    $(339.7           )
transmission costs                       102.9
total purchased power and transmission   $(236.8           )
60
included in purchased power costs are the costs associated with nstar electric's basic service charge and deferred energy supply costs. the basic service charge recovers energy-related costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers who have not migrated to third party suppliers. the decrease in purchased power costs was due primarily to lower prices associated with the procurement of energy supply and lower sales volumes. the increase in transmission costs was primarily the result of an increase in the retail transmission cost deferral, which reflects the actual costs of transmission service compared to estimated amounts billed to customers. the increase in transmission costs was also driven by costs billed by iso-ne that support regional grid investment.
operations and maintenance expense includes tracked costs and costs that are part of base distribution rates with changes impacting earnings (non-tracked costs). operations and maintenance expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, driven by a $59.9 million increase in non-tracked costs, which was primarily attributable to the absence in 2016 of the resolution of the basic service bad debt adder mechanism recorded in 2015 ($24.2 million), higher bad debt expense due primarily to the absence of a regulatory benefit related to certain uncollectible hardship accounts receivable that was recorded in 2015, higher vegetation management expense, and higher storm restoration costs. additionally, there was a $26.8 million increase in tracked costs, which have no earnings impact, that was primarily attributable to higher employee-related expenses due to increased current year collections of a prior year pension and pbop costs underrecovery and higher bad debt expense.
depreciation increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher utility plant in service balances.
amortization of regulatory assets/(liabilities), net, reflects the absence in 2016 of an $11.7 million benefit recognized in the first quarter of 2015 related to the comprehensive settlement agreement, and the deferral adjustment of certain costs that exceeded billed revenues in 2016 as compared to 2015. the deferral adjusts expense to match the corresponding revenues. these deferred costs, which can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and related rate changes to recover these costs, are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.
energy efficiency programs, expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily the deferral adjustments, which reflects the actual costs of energy efficiency programs compared to the amount billed to customers and the timing of the recovery of energy efficiency costs incurred in accordance with the three-year program guidelines established by the dpu. the deferral adjusts expense to match the energy efficiency programs revenue. the costs for state energy policy initiatives and expanded energy efficiency programs are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.
taxes other than income taxes expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in utility plant balances.
interest expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to an increase in interest on long-term debt ($10.6 million), partially offset by a decrease in regulatory deferrals which decreased interest expense ($1.8 million).
other income, net increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher afudc on equity funds ($5.8 million).
income tax expense decreased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to lower pre-tax earnings ($32.5 million), lower state taxes ($5.6 million), items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) and permanent differences ($1.1 million), and the excess tax benefit due to the adoption of new accounting guidance related to share based payment transactions ($1 million).
earnings summary nstar electric's earnings decreased $51.8 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to the absence in 2016 of both the 2015 resolution of the basic service bad debt adder mechanism ($14.5 million) and the 2015 favorable impact associated with the comprehensive settlement agreement ($13 million), the absence of a regulatory benefit related to certain uncollectible hardship accounts receivable that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015, higher operations and maintenance expense, lower retail sales volumes and higher depreciation expense. these unfavorable earnings impacts were partially offset by an increase in transmission earnings, which was driven by a higher transmission rate base as well as the absence in 2016 of the 2015 ferc roe complaint proceedings reserve charge.
liquidity nstar electric had cash flows provided by operating activities of $641.4 million in 2016, as compared to $657.0 million in 2015. the decrease in operating cash flows was due primarily to income tax payments of $80.7 million made in 2016, compared to income tax refunds of $19.8 million received in 2015, changes related to working capital items, including the timing of accounts payable payments and the collections of accounts receivable, and an increase in 2016 of $27.4 million in pension and pbop plan cash contributions. partially offsetting these impacts was an increase in regulatory recoveries due to collections from customers in excess of purchased power costs and energy efficiency programs.
nstar electric has a $450.0 million commercial paper program allowing nstar electric to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, nstar electric had $126.5 million and $62.5 million, respectively, in short-term borrowings outstanding under its commercial paper program, leaving $323.5 million and $387.5 million of available borrowing capacity as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 was 0.71 percent and 0.40 percent, respectively. nstar electric is a party to a five-year $450.0 million revolving credit facility. effective september 26, 2016, the revolving credit facility's termination date was extended for one additional year to september 4, 2021.  the revolving credit facility serves to backstop nstar electric's $450.0 million commercial paper program. there were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2016 or 2015.

psnh's operating revenues, which consist of base distribution revenues and tracked revenues further described below, decreased by $12.7 million in 2016, as compared to 2015.
base distribution revenues: base distribution revenues increased $3.3 million due primarily to a $5.3 million increase as a result of distribution rate increases effective july 1, 2015 and july 1, 2016. partially offsetting this increase was a 0.8 percent decrease in sales volumes due primarily to increased customer energy conservation efforts, including those resulting from company-sponsored energy efficiency programs.
tracked revenues: tracked revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in rates through nhpuc-approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore have no impact on earnings. costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include energy supply costs and costs associated with the generation of electricity for customers, retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs and stranded cost recovery revenues. in addition, tracked revenues include certain incentives earned and carrying charges. tracked distribution revenues decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in energy supply costs and a reduction in wholesale generation revenues in 2016, as compared to 2015 ($36.5 million), driven by lower sales volumes. stranded cost recovery charges decreased by $7.7 million in 2016, as compared to 2015. in addition, psnh's generation rate base increased, which provided an increase to generation revenues that impacted earnings of $6.9 million.
transmission revenues increased by $23.8 million due primarily to higher revenue requirements associated with ongoing investments in our transmission infrastructure and the absence in 2016 of a $1 million reserve charge recorded in 2015 associated with the march 2015 ferc roe order.
purchased power, fuel and transmission expense includes costs associated with psnh's generation of electricity as well as purchasing electricity on behalf of its customers. these generation and energy supply costs are recovered from customers in nhpuc-approved cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on earnings (tracked costs). purchased power, fuel and transmission expense decreased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to the following:
(millions of dollars)                          (decrease)/increase purchased power and generation fuel costs      $(56.2            )
transmission costs                             19.3
total purchased power, fuel and transmission   $(36.9            )
in order to meet the demand of customers who have not migrated to third party suppliers, psnh procures power through power supply contracts and spot purchases in the competitive new england wholesale power market and/or produces power through its own generation. the decrease in purchased power and generation fuel costs was due primarily to a decrease in the amount of electricity generated by psnh facilities. the increase in transmission costs was primarily the result of an increase in costs billed by iso-ne that support regional grid investment.
62
operations and maintenance expense includes tracked costs and costs that are part of base distribution rates with changes impacting earnings (non-tracked costs). operations and maintenance expense decreased in 2016, as compared to 2015, driven by an $11.9 million decrease in non-tracked costs that was primarily attributable to lower employee-related expenses and the absence in 2016 of a $5 million contribution recorded in 2015 to create a clean energy fund in connection with the generation divestiture agreement. additionally, there was a $3.8 million decrease in tracked costs, which have no earnings impact, that was primarily attributable to lower contractor costs due to the timing of planned outages at psnh's generation facilities, and lower employee-related expenses, partially offset by higher transmission expenses.
depreciation expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher utility plant in service balances.
amortization of regulatory assets, net expense includes the deferral to expense of energy supply costs and the amortization of certain costs, which are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings. the decrease in 2016, as compared to 2015, was due primarily to the deferral adjustment of the stranded cost recovery charge. the deferral adjusts expense to match the corresponding revenues.
taxes other than income taxes expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in utility plant balances.
interest expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015 due primarily to an increase in regulatory deferrals which increased interest expense.
other income, net decreased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to a decrease in gains related to deferred compensation plans ($1.0 million) and lower afudc on equity funds ($0.9 million).
income tax expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($9.3 million) and higher state taxes ($1.1 million), partially offset by items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) and permanent differences ($0.8 million), and the excess tax benefit due to the adoption of new accounting guidance related to share based payment transactions ($0.4 million).
earnings summary psnh's earnings increased $17.6 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to an increase in transmission earnings, which was driven by a higher transmission rate base as well as the absence in 2016 of the 2015 ferc roe complaint proceedings reserve charge, higher generation earnings, lower operations and maintenance expense, and the impact of the distribution rate increases effective july 1, 2015 and july 1, 2016. these favorable earnings impacts were partially offset by higher depreciation expense, higher property tax expense, and lower retail sales volumes.
liquidity psnh had cash flows provided by operating activities of $361.8 million in 2016, as compared to $274.5 million in 2015. the increase in operating cash flows was due primarily to the income tax refunds of $36.0 million received in 2016, compared to income tax payments of $14.4 million made in 2015, as well as rate increases effective in 2016. in addition, there was a favorable impact due to the timing of payments related to our accounts payable and other working capital items. partially offsetting these favorable impacts were an increase in pension and pbop plan cash contributions of $16.1 million and timing of collections related to accounts receivable.

operating revenues wmeco's retail sales volumes were as follows:
for the years ended december 31,
2016                                       2015                   decrease           percent retail sales volumes in gwh   3,546             3,563             (17    )           (0.5   )%
wmeco's operating revenues, which consist of base distribution revenues and tracked revenues further described below, decreased by $33.9 million in 2016, as compared to 2015.
fluctuations in wmeco's sales volumes do not impact the level of base distribution revenue realized or earnings due to the dpu approved revenue decoupling mechanism. wmeco's revenue decoupling mechanism permits recovery of a base amount of distribution revenues ($132.4 million annually) and breaks the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized. the revenue decoupling mechanism results in the recovery of approved base distribution revenue requirements.
fluctuations in the overall level of operating revenues are primarily related to tracked revenues. tracked revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in rates through dpu-approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore have no impact on earnings. costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include energy supply costs, retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, low income assistance programs, and restructuring and stranded cost recovery revenues. in addition, tracked revenues include certain incentives earned and carrying charges. tracked revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in energy supply costs ($50.8 million) driven by decreased average retail rates and lower sales volumes.
transmission revenues increased by $15.6 million due primarily to higher revenue requirements associated with ongoing investments in our transmission infrastructure and the absence in 2016 of a $4.1 million reserve charge recorded in 2015 associated with the march 2015 ferc roe order.
purchased power and transmission expense includes costs associated with the purchasing of energy supply on behalf of wmeco's customers. these energy supply costs are recovered from customers in dpu-approved cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on earnings (tracked costs). purchased power and transmission expense decreased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to the following:
(millions of dollars)                    (decrease)/increase purchased power costs                    $(55.2            )
transmission costs                       9.4
total purchased power and transmission   $(45.8            )
included in purchased power costs are the costs associated with wmeco's basic service charge and deferred energy supply costs. the basic service charge recovers energy-related costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers who have not migrated to third party suppliers. the decrease in purchased power costs was due primarily to lower prices associated with the procurement of energy supply and lower sales volumes. the increase in transmission costs was primarily the result of an increase in costs billed by iso-ne that support regional grid investment.

operations and maintenance expense includes tracked costs and costs that are part of base distribution rates with changes impacting earnings (non-tracked costs). operations and maintenance expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, driven by a $6.7 million increase in tracked costs, which have no earnings impact, that was primarily attributable to higher transmission expenses and the deferral of recs generated and sold by the wmeco solar program, and an increase of $3.7 million in non-tracked costs that was primarily attributable to higher storm restoration costs, the write-off of software design costs and higher employee-related expenses.
depreciation expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher utility plant in service balances.
amortization of regulatory assets/(liabilities), net expense decreased in 2016 as compared to 2015, due to the timing of refunds or recovery of tracked costs, which are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.
energy efficiency programs expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to the deferral adjustments, which reflect the actual costs of energy efficiency programs compared to the amount billed to customers and the timing of the recovery of energy efficiency costs incurred in accordance with the three-year program guidelines established by the dpu. the deferral adjusts expense to match the energy efficiency programs revenue. the costs for state energy policy initiatives and expanded energy efficiency programs are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.
taxes other than income taxes expense increased in 2016, as compared 2015, due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in utility plant balances.
other income, net decreased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to lower afudc on equity funds ($1.7 million) and a decrease in net gains related to the deferred compensation plans ($0.7 million).
income tax expense increased in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($1.0 million) and various other items ($0.2 million), partially offset by the excess tax benefit due to the adoption of new accounting guidance related to share based payment transactions ($0.2 million).
earnings summary wmeco's earnings increased $1.6 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to an increase in transmission earnings, which was driven by the absence in 2016 of the 2015 ferc roe complaint proceedings reserve charge as well as a higher transmission rate base, and lower interest expense on long-term debt. these favorable earnings impacts were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense, higher property and other taxes expense, and higher depreciation expense.
liquidity wmeco had cash flows provided by operating activities of $167.3 million in 2016, as compared to $43.0 million in 2015. the increase in operating cash flows was due primarily to the absence in 2016 of a $57.4 million payment made in 2015 from wmeco's spent nuclear fuel trust to fully satisfy the pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel obligation with the doe, and income tax refunds of $14.7 million in 2016, compared to income tax payments of $14.7 million in 2015. in addition, the timing of regulatory recoveries, the receipt of $3.6 million in doe damages proceeds received from the yankee companies, and the timing of working capital items all had a favorable impact on operating cash flows in 2016, as compared to 2015.

item 1a. risk factors.
our business faces significant risks. these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial. our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks, and the trading prices of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks. these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report.
risks relating to our business we operate in the highly competitive health care industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully.
each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment. in our soft contact lens business, coopervision faces intense competition from competitors' products, in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses, and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market. our major competitors in the contact lens business, johnson & johnson vision care, inc., alcon (owned by novartis ag) and bausch & lomb, inc. (owned by valeant pharmaceuticals international, inc.), have substantially greater financial resources, larger research and development budgets, larger sales forces, greater market penetration and/or larger manufacturing volumes than coopervision. they offer competitive products and differentiated materials, plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses. the market for contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel based products. our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to introduce new products successfully, on a timely basis in the americas, emea and asia pacific, and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products. any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend, in part, on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities. our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
to a lesser extent, coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery.
there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future, for example with increased product entries from asia pacific contact lens manufacturers, or that our competitors' newer contact lens products will not successfully erode coopervision's contact lens business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in the women's health care market, competitive factors include technological and scientific advances, product quality, price and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals. coopersurgical competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its niche areas, some of which have substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products, which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products.
acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future involve numerous risks.
we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years. as part of our growth strategy, particularly at coopersurgical and more recently at coopervision, we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies, products and businesses. future
18
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization and/or impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. coopervision completed the acquisition of soflex in fiscal 2016 and sauflon pharmaceuticals limited in fiscal 2014. coopersurgical acquired wallace in november 2016; reprogenetics uk, recombine, k-systems, genesis genetics, the pipette company, and research instruments in fiscal 2016; and reprogenetics us in fiscal 2015. these acquisitions added operations to coopervision and coopersurgical, respectively, and expanded their international businesses. the acquisitions have, correspondingly, added risks we could face with respect to acquisitions and include:
•   failure to successfully obtain the anticipated revenues, margins and earnings benefits;
•   difficulties in, and expenses related to, the integration of the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired company and establishment of appropriate accounting controls and reporting procedures and other regulatory compliance procedures, including but not limited to third party compliance and due diligence;
•   increased leverage and the risk of lack of access to available financing, including financing for the acquisition or refinancing of debt owed by us on a timely basis and on reasonable terms;
•   risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;
•   potential loss of employees;
•   an inability to identify and consummate future acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;
•   diversion of management's attention away from other business concerns;
•   expenses of any undisclosed or potential liabilities, contingent liabilities or indemnification obligations of the acquired company;
•   expenses, including restructuring expenses, to shut-down our own locations or terminate our employees;
•   a dilution of earnings per share; and
•   risks inherent in accounting allocations and the risk that we are required to record significant adjustments to the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed within the measurement period.
product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate, and we face the risk of product obsolescence if we are unable to develop new products or gain regulatory approvals or if our competitors introduce new products.
product innovations are important in the contact lens market in which coopervision competes and in the areas of the health care industry in which coopersurgical competes. coopersurgical has not allocated substantial resources to new product development, but rather it has historically purchased, leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others. coopersurgical has recently invested in expanding the internal research and development function with the goal of organizational growth and to complement our acquisitions strategy. coopervision invests in new product development, including the development of silicone hydrogel-based contact lenses. research and development time commitments, higher feasibility risk with longer term projects, the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial. there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our new products or that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and, as a result, justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval. in addition, our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies, such as contact lenses with anti-microbial or anti-allergenic features, or "smart" contact lenses which
19
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries incorporate electronics, that could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products. competitors may also introduce new uses for contact lenses, such as for drug delivery or the control of myopia. failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
if our products are not accepted by the market, we will not be able to sustain or expand our business.
certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced, and we cannot assure that any of them, assuming they receive necessary regulatory approvals, will achieve market acceptance or generate operating profits. the development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors, some of which are out of our control, including:
•   acceptance of our products by eye care and health care practitioners;
•   the cost competitiveness of our products;
•   consumer reluctance to try and use a new product;
•   regulatory and legislative requirements;
•   adequate coverage and reimbursement by third party payors;
•   the earlier release of competitive products, such as new silicone hydrogel products, into the market by our competitors; and
•   the emergence of newer and more competitive products.
new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products.
technological developments in the eye care, family and women's health care industries, such as new surgical procedures or medical devices, may limit demand for our products. corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products. if these new advances provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction, the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease. we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses.
our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results.
a significant portion of our current operations are conducted and located outside the united states, and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions. we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america, latin america and europe. over half of our net sales for the fiscal years ended october 31, 2016 and 2015, were derived from the sale of products outside the united states. we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future. international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks, including:
•   we may have difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights in some foreign countries;
•   we may have difficulty gaining market share in countries such as japan because of regulatory restrictions and customer preferences;
20
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries
•   we may find it difficult to grow in emerging markets such as china, india, russia, brazil and other developing nations due to, among other things, customer acceptance, undeveloped and/or unfamiliar distribution channels, regulatory restrictions and changes, and business knowledge of these new markets;
•   tax rates in some foreign countries may exceed those of the united states, and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;
•   we may find it difficult to comply with a variety of united states and foreign legal, compliance and regulatory requirements such as the foreign corrupt practices act, the dodd-frank act, the u.k. bribery act and international data security and privacy laws;
•   we may find it difficult to manage a large organization spread throughout various countries;
•   fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results;
•   foreign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the united states;
•   failure to comply with united states department of commerce and other nations import-export controls may result in fines and/or penalties;
•   general economic and political conditions in the countries where we operate may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries or not be favorable to our growth strategy;
•   foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business and market opportunities, including but not limited to increased enforcement of potentially conflicting and ambiguous anti-bribery laws;
•   we may have difficulty enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems; and
•   we may be subject to unforseen economic or political events in certain countries that may have an impact on our customers' ability or preferences to buy our products.
as we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. however, any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our operating results.
current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business.
over the last few years in the united states and globally, market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth. foreign countries, in particular the euro zone, have experienced recessionary pressures and face continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions and geopolitical issues. concerns about the euro zone's sovereign debt in recent years have caused uncertainty and disruption in the financial markets globally. while the global financial markets have showed general signs of improvement, uncertainty remains. as a result, we may have lower than historical performance for market growth in fiscal 2017.
any negative impact on economic conditions and international markets, continued volatility or deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets, inflation, deflation or other adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers. it may limit our ability, and the ability of our customers, to replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
21
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries the results of the united kingdom's referendum on withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.
we are a multinational company headquartered in the united states with worldwide operations, including significant business operations in europe, including in the united kingdom. in june 2016, a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum. the referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the united kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process. nevertheless, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union.
this development has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what implications the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union would have and how such withdrawal could affect or could have a material adverse effect on, our business, financial condition and operating results.
we face risks associated with disruption of our manufacturing and distribution operations including possible failure to develop necessary manufacturing processes, or idle or excess capacity could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position.
we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell. any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing or distribution facilities, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, integration difficulties, destruction of or damage to any facility (as a result of natural disaster, use and storage of hazardous materials or other events), enforcement action by the fda or other regulatory body if we are found to be in non-compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cgmp) or other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective. while we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products, our failure to continue to develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete. conversely, excess or idle capacity, which could result from acquisitions, inaccurate sales forecasting or unexpected manufacturing efficiencies, could significantly impact our profitability and near term financial condition.
coopervision manufactures molded contact lenses, which represent the majority of our contact lens revenues, primarily at our facilities in the united kingdom, puerto rico, hungary, costa rica and new york. coopersurgical manufactures the majority of its products in connecticut, texas, and denmark. we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets, and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site. before we can use a second manufacturing site, we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities, and because this process is expensive, we generally have not sought approvals needed to manufacture at an additional site. if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility, it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product, which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales, profitability and market share.
coopervision distributes products out of new york, the united kingdom, belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities. coopersurgical's products are primarily distributed out of its facilities in connecticut, and denmark. any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution facilities, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, destruction of or damage to any facility (as a result
22
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries of natural disaster, use and storage of hazardous materials or other events) or other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations, our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted, our products could be subject to recall, and sales and profitability could suffer.
our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal, state and foreign regulatory requirements, including the fda's cgmp for medical devices, known as the qsr regulations, which govern the procedures related to the design, testing, production processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage, importing, exporting and shipping of our products. we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices. in addition, we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies, including the fda, state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries. failure to comply with qsr requirements and other applicable regulatory requirements or to respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to, among other things, warning letters, significant fines, injunctions, suspension of approvals, seizures, recalls or import holds of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. as a result, any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability.
we rely on independent suppliers for raw materials and we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice.
we rely on independent suppliers for key raw materials, consisting largely of various chemicals and packaging materials. raw materials used in our operations are generally available from more than one source. however, because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures, we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice. for example, some of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products, including myday, biofinity, avaira and clariti, are supplied by a sole supplier. we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products if our suppliers, particularly those which are the sole source of any necessary material, fail to supply sufficient material on a timely basis or at all for any reason and/or we need to switch to an alternative supplier. a disruption in the supply of raw materials could disrupt production of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products, thereby adversely impacting our ability to market and sell such products and our ability to compete in this important segment of the contact lens market.
if we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately, our business could suffer.
we consider our intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, trademarks and licensing agreements, to be an integral component of our business. we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we also may seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation. our claims, even if meritorious, may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights. in addition, litigation can:
•   be expensive and time consuming to prosecute or defend;
23
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries
•   result in a finding that we do not have certain intellectual property rights or that such rights lack sufficient scope or strength;
•   divert management's attention and resources; or
•   require us to license our intellectual property.
we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products. we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will be approved. patent applications in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for a period of time, which may last until patents are issued, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months, we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions. the patents we own could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage. we also cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents.
both coopervision and coopersurgical also rely on proprietary technology which is unpatented. it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements, which generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. however, we cannot assure that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult, expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable.
we rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products. to maintain the value of our trademarks, we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks. we also might not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications, and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties. enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages, including the inability to continue using certain trademarks.
the laws of foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united states. adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products, and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our products or processes could be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others.
our competitors in both the united states and foreign countries, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products. in the contact lens industry, coopervision and its competitors all hold patents covering contact lens designs, business methods, processes and materials.
24
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries claims that our products, business methods or processes infringe upon the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales of products incorporating our technology.
significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industries. for example, coopervision has faced significant patent litigation over its silicone hydrogel contact lens products. third parties have made, and may make in the future, claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology. any claims, even those without merit, could:
•   be expensive and time consuming to defend;
•   cause us to cease making, licensing or selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;
•   require us to redesign or re-engineer our products, if feasible;
•   divert management's attention and resources; or
•   require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a necessary product, component or process.
we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation. any royalty or licensing agreement, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of some of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology, in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market, could adversely affect our business.
we could experience losses from product liability claims or legal claims relating to our service offerings, including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products.
we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury. we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers, distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand. additionally, we face the inherent risk of exposure to legal claims, including negligence, relating to our provision of certain service offerings, including our genetic testing services and their accuracy. consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product or service that is the subject of a claim or recall, or has been counterfeited. we handle some risk with third-party carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations. there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls, legal claims relating to our service offerings, or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing products, in the future.
we face risks related to environmental matters.
our facilities are subject to a broad range of united states federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and requirements, including those governing discharges to the air and water, the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes, remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health. we have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements. future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, or the enforcement thereof, or the discovery of contamination at our facilities, may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have
25
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. such laws and requirements are constantly changing, are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations. as a manufacturer of various products, we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters, and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims.
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.
we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness.
our indebtedness could:
•   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
•   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;
•   limit our ability to borrow additional funds; and
•   make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, including our obligation to repay our credit facilities under certain circumstances, or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all.
our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt, which could adversely affect our business, earnings and financial condition.
we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt.
we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt. in order to maintain a desired mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, we may use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed and variable-rate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements, without exchange of the underlying principal amounts. we may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to manage our risks effectively and, which could adversely affect our business, earnings and financial condition.
exchange rate fluctuations and our foreign currency hedges could adversely affect our financial results.
as a result of our international operations, currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position. our most significant currency exposures are the british pound sterling, euro and japanese yen. we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than u.s. dollars. to the extent we are unable to materially offset non-nonfunctional currency flows, exchange rate fluctuations could have a positive or negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. because our consolidated financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies, the translation of those results into u.s.
26
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings and can make it more difficult for our shareholders to understand the relative strengths or weaknesses of the underlying business on a period-over-period comparative basis. although from time to time we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our non-functional currency obligations or balances, these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely.
increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns could adversely affect our results.
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where the company has higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where it has lower statutory rates, by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws. we are also subject to the examination of our income tax returns by other tax authorities and the outcome of these examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results.
we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results. we have overseas manufacturing, administrative and sales offices and generate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions. the international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries, both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting (beps) and perceived international tax avoidance techniques. the recommendations of the beps project led by the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) are involved in much of the coordinated activity, although the timing and methods of implementation vary. additionally, comprehensive us tax reform has been stated to be a priority for the us congress. such changes in tax laws or their interpretation, if adopted, could adversely affect our effective tax rates and our results.
volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension costs.
we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for employees in the united states. this defined benefit pension plan is funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. changes in interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, investment returns, discount rates and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plan. a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.
we manage our businesses utilizing complex integrated software and hardware information technology operating systems that are regularly maintained and upgraded; an interruption or disruption to these systems could disrupt our business or force us to expend excessive costs.
we utilize complex integrated software and hardware operating systems, including enterprise resource planning and warehouse management systems, to support our business units and we have a continuous improvement strategy in place to keep our systems and overarching technology stable and in line with business needs and growth. regular upgrades of our computer hardware and software revisions are typical and expected. we employ controlled change management methodologies to plan, test and execute all such
27
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries system upgrades and improvements, and we believe that we assign adequate staffing and other resources to projects to ensure successful implementation. however, we cannot assure that our systems will meet our future business needs or that upgrades will operate as designed. we cannot assure that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business in the course of our maintenance, support and/or upgrade of these systems.
we are in the midst of a multiyear process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning (erp) system at coopervision. implementing a new erp system is not only costly but complex and difficult.  implementing a new erp system can negatively affect not only financial accounting and reporting processes but also external commercial activities such as order receipt and product delivery. there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement our new erp system or that we will avoid these and other negative impacts from our implementation efforts.
we attempt to protect our computer and communications systems but may experience interruptions and breaches including computer viruses, malicious software, cyberattacks and "hacking," that could impair our ability to conduct business and communicate internally and with our customers, or result in the theft of trade secrets or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise privacy of our sensitive information, or that of our customers or other business partners.
if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees, our business could suffer.
if we fail to recruit and retain the necessary personnel, our business and our ability to obtain new customers, develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer. the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel. our success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled sales, marketing, engineering and scientific personnel. competition for these persons in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to successfully recruit, train or retain qualified personnel.
provisions of our governing documents and delaware law, and our rights plan, may have anti-takeover effects.
certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors. these provisions include: (i) advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations and (ii) the authority of our board to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock with such terms as our board may determine. we also have the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which could have similar effects. our board of directors extended our preferred stock purchase rights plan, commonly known as a "poison pill," pursuant to an amended rights agreement dated as of october 29, 2007, that expires on october 29, 2017. the rights agreement is intended to prevent abusive hostile takeover attempts by requiring a potential acquirer to negotiate the terms of an acquisition with our board of directors. however, it could have the effect of deterring or preventing an acquisition of our company, even if a majority of our stockholders would be in favor of such acquisition, and could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to gain control of the company or to change existing management.
28
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products and services our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance or approval for our products or operations could adversely affect our business.
our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda, and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. in the united states, the fda regulates virtually all aspects of a medical device's design, development, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling (including, for example, unique device identifier regulations), storage, recordkeeping, reporting, marketing, promotion, advertising and distribution, as well as product import and export. our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions, including injunctions, fines, warning letters, suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals, product recalls, termination of distribution or product seizures. in the most egregious cases, criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible.
our medical devices require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the united states and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions. medical devices may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared. the process of obtaining, renewing and maintaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the fda, can be costly and time consuming. there can be no assurance that such clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, and significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur, which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations. in addition, the fda and authorities in foreign jurisdictions may change their policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products or could impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products. for example, the fda recently has been reviewing the premarket clearance process in response to internal and external concerns regarding the 510(k) premarket clearance program. in january 2011, the fda announced a plan of action that included twenty-five action items designed to make the process more rigorous and transparent. since then the fda has implemented some changes intended to improve its premarket programs. some of the changes and proposals under consideration could impose additional regulatory requirements on us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances for our products, increase the cost of compliance, or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances.
modifications and enhancements to a medical device also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture. the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the fda may review any manufacturer's decision. we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or application, but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions. if the fda requires us to seek clearance or approval for a modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position. we also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications, if required.
even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted, the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted, and failure to comply with fda regulations prohibiting a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved, or "off-label" use could result in enforcement action by the fda, including, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil or criminal penalties.

the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries increased regulatory scrutiny of genetic testing may adversely affect our business through increased costs and risks associated with gaining marketing approvals and potential decreased demand for our genetic testing services.
with our acquisition of reprogenetics in august 2015, genesis genetics in march 2016, recombine in may 2016 and reprogenetics uk in may 2016, we now offer certain genetic testing services to help identify the likelihood of pregnancy as well as identify possible disorders or diseases of a child prior to birth. regulatory and legislative proposals addressing oversight of genetic testing have been introduced in the united states, and we expect that new proposals will be introduced from time to time both in the united states and in foreign countries in the future. although the fda has statutory authority to assure that medical devices, including ivds, are safe and effective for their intended uses, the fda has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the fdca and regulations with respect to ldts. we believe our tests fall within the definition of an ldt. as a result, we believe our tests are not currently subject to the fda's enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable fdca provisions. however, our tests may in the future become subject to more onerous regulation by the fda. legislative proposals addressing the fda's oversight of ldts have been introduced by congress in the past and new legislative proposals may be introduced from time to time in the future. the likelihood that congress will pass such legislation and the extent to which such legislation may affect the fda's ability to enforce its medical device regulations with respect to certain ldts is difficult to predict at this time. if the fda ultimately begins to enforce its medical device requirements with respect to ldts, our genetic tests may be subject to additional regulatory requirements imposed by the fda, the nature and extent of which would depend upon applicable final guidance or regulation by the fda or instruction by congress. if the fda imposes significant changes to the regulation of ldts it could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.
any new fda enforcement policies affecting ldts or new legislation, regulations or guidance may result in increased regulatory burdens on our ability to continue marketing our products and to develop and introduce new products in the future, which could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.
if we fail to comply with applicable federal, state, local and foreign laboratory licensing requirements, we could lose the ability to perform our tests or experience disruptions to our business.
we are subject to the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 (clia), a federal law regulating clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. our clinical laboratory must be certified under clia in order for us to perform testing on human specimens. in addition, our proprietary tests must also be recognized as part of our accredited programs under clia so that we can offer them in our laboratory. clia is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the united states by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. the law also requires us to maintain a state laboratory license to conduct testing in that state. our laboratories are located in california, florida, illinois, michigan, new jersey, oregon, texas, and internationally in canada and the united kingdom, and we must maintain the requisite licenses in each jurisdiction.
30
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries development and marketing of our products are subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to receive, or delay in receiving, foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business.
in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products, we are subject to regulations affecting, among other things, product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, the reporting of certain payments to health care practitioners in certain markets (for example, the french sunshine act of 2013), duties and tax requirements. many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda.
in the european economic area, a medical device can only be placed on the market if it is in conformity with the essential requirements set out in the european directives and implementing regulations that govern medical devices. these directives prescribe quality programs and standards which must be maintained in order to achieve required iso certification and to approve the use of ce marking. in order to maintain iso certification and ce marking quality benchmarks, firms' quality systems and procedures are subjected to rigorous periodic inspections and reassessment audits.
in many countries, the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility. to date, we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations. however, our failure to receive, or delays in the receipt of, relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls, even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval, which could harm our reputation, business and financial results.
after a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply, including the fda's qsr regulations, which require manufacturers to follow, among other things, design, testing, production, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or "off-label" uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. medical device manufacturers, such as coopervision and coopersurgical, may under their own initiative recall a product if a reasonable possibility of serious injury or any material deficiency in a device is found or withdraw a product to improve device performance or for other reasons. the fda requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the fda within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. recalls of any of our products may divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. a recall could harm our reputation with customers and consumers which could reduce the sales of our products. in addition, the fda or other foreign governmental agencies may implement enforcement actions in connection with a recall which could impair our product offerings and be harmful to our business and financial results.
31
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries changes in legislation and government regulation of the health care industry as well as third-party payors' efforts to control the costs of health care could materially adversely affect our business.
in recent years, an increasing number of health care reform proposals have been formulated by the legislative and executive branches of the united states federal and state governments. in march 2010, president obama signed the affordable care act (aca). the aca makes extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the united states. among the provisions of the affordable care act, of greatest importance to the medical device industry are the following:
•   establishment of the patient-centered outcomes research institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
•   reporting and disclosure requirements on medical device manufacturers for certain payments or other "transfers of value" made to physicians and physicians family members, certain healthcare facilities, and any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and physician family members, and any payments or other "transfers of value" to such owners. manufacturers are required to submit reports to the centers for medicare &amp; medicaid services (cms) by the 90th day of each calendar year;
•   a 2.3 percent excise tax, currently suspended until 2018, on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the united states, with limited exceptions, which exceptions include all contact lenses;
•   payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain health care services through bundled payment models;
•   creation of the independent payment advisory board which has authority to recommend certain changes to reduce medicare spending and those recommendations could have the effect of law even if congress doesn't act on the recommendations; and
•   establishment of a center for medicare innovation at cms to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower medicare and medicaid spending.
these measures could result in decreased net revenues or increased expenses from our medical device products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts. there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the aca, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the aca in the future, particularly in the light of the pending change in administrations following the u.s. presidential election.
other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the affordable care act was enacted. on august 2, 2011, the president signed into law the budget control act of 2011, which, among other things, created the joint select committee on deficit reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to congress. the joint select committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reductions to several government programs. these reductions include aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on april 1, 2013 and, due to the bipartisan budget act of 2015, will remain in effect until 2025 unless additional action is taken by congress. on january 2, 2013, president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers. in addition, on april 16, 2015, president obama signed into law the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015, or macra, which among other things, repealed the formula by which medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments scheduled to begin in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians' participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations.
32
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries we expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future, including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services, which could adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products, or result in additional pricing pressures. also, any adoption of health care reform proposals on a state-by-state basis could require us to develop state-specific marketing and sales approaches. we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business.
in addition, third-party payors, whether governmental or commercial, whether inside the united states or abroad, increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care. these cost-control methods include prospective payment systems, capitated rates, group purchasing, redesign of benefits, requiring pre-authorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures, encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more cost-effective methods of delivering health care. although cost controls or other requirements imposed by third-party payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices, this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we may enroll as in-network providers and suppliers with certain payors. although, becoming an in-network provider or enrolling as a supplier means that we have agreed with these payors to provide certain of our tests at negotiated rates, it does not obligate any physicians to order our tests or guarantee that we will receive reimbursement for our tests from these or any other payors at adequate levels. thus, these payor relationships, or any similar relationships we may establish in the future, may not result in acceptable levels of reimbursement for our tests or meaningful increases in our physician customer base. we cannot predict whether, under what circumstances, or at what payment levels payors will cover and reimburse for our tests. if we fail to establish and maintain broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests, our ability to generate increased revenue and grow our test volume and customer base could be limited and our future prospects and our business could suffer.
the costs of complying with the requirements of federal and state laws pertaining to the privacy and security of health information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
other federal legislation affects the manner in which we use and disclose health information. the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, or hipaa, mandates, among other things, the adoption of standards for the electronic exchange of health information that may require significant and costly changes to current practices. the united states department of health and human services (hhs) has released several rules mandating the use of specified standards with respect to certain health care transactions and health information. the electronic transactions rule requires the use of uniform standards for common health care transactions, including health care claims information, plan eligibility, referral certification and authorization, claims status, plan enrollment and disenrollment, payment and remittance advice, plan premium payments and coordination of benefits. the privacy rule imposes standards governing the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information. the security rule released by hhs establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information, and requires the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards.
additionally, the health information technology for economic and clinical health (hitech) act of 2009 was signed into law as part of the america's recovery and reinvestment act in february 2009. the final omnibus privacy, security, breach notification and enforcement rules (omnibus final rule), implementing hipaa and hitech, became effective in september 2013. under the hitech act and the omnibus final
33
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries rule, certain of hipaa's privacy and security standards are now directly applicable to covered entities' business associates. as a result, business associates are now subject to civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable privacy and security rule requirements. moreover, the hitech act and the omnibus final rule set forth new notification requirements and standards for health data security breaches, increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce hipaa and seek attorney's fees and costs associated with pursuing federal actions. while there is no private right of action under hipaa that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for violations, hipaa's standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing individuals' health information. further, varying state laws governing the use and disclosure of personally indentifiable information may be more restrictive than hipaa, which means that entities subject to them must comply with the more restrictive state law in addition to complying with hipaa. in some cases, a breach may be required to be reported under state law and affected individuals notified, even if the breach is not reportable or subject to breach notification requirements under hipaa. state laws may impose separate fines and penalties upon violators, and some, unlike hipaa, may afford a private right of action to state residents who believe their information has been misused.
our genetics testing subsidiaries are covered entities under hipaa. one other subsidiary, eye care prime llc, which offers value-added software solutions for eye care professionals, may be a covered entity or business associate under hipaa. similarly, many of our customers may be covered entities or business associates subject to hipaa. some customers as an expectation of transacting business with us may require us to enter into business associate agreements, which would obligate us to safeguard and restrict the manner in which we use certain hipaa protected health information that we obtain in the course of our commercial relationship with them, triggering potential liability on us for failure to meet our contractual obligations. alternatively, some customers may limit the scope of our commercial relationship with them with regard to our access to certain protected health information. if the government determines that our other subsidiaries are a covered entity, business associate, or subcontractor of a covered entity or subcontractor, we could be faced with additional costs related to hipaa compliance and subject to governmental enforcement for failure to comply with hipaa, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reputation.
laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we may be subject to various federal, state and foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws, physician self-referral laws and false claims laws. violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including medicare, medicaid, veterans administration health programs and tricare. similarly, if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws, because of the complex and far-reaching nature of these laws, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws.
indeed, changes in state laws and model codes of ethics have required us to alter certain of our compliance efforts. for example, in april of 2009, massachusetts issued regulations governing the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with respect to health care practitioners. this regulation became effective on july 1, 2009 and sets forth what medical device manufacturers may and may not
34
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries permissibly do with respect to providing meals, sponsoring continuing medical education and otherwise providing payments or items of economic benefit to health care practitioners located within the state. additionally, the regulation requires medical device manufacturers to have in place robust fraud and abuse compliance programs. other states (e.g., california, vermont and nevada) have adopted similar laws. these laws and regulations act to limit our marketing practices, require the dedication of resources to ensure compliance, and expose us to additional liabilities.
in addition, the aca, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute and certain criminal health care fraud statutes so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. the aca also provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of these statutes constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act or the civil monetary penalties statute.
any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, changes in these laws, regulations, or administrative or judicial interpretations, may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
ethical, legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our tests.
genetic testing has raised ethical, legal and social issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information. government authorities could, for social or other purposes, limit or regulate the use of genetic information or genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure. similarly, these concerns may lead patients to refuse to use, or physicians to be reluctant to order, genetic tests even if permissible. these and other ethical, legal and social concerns may limit market acceptance and adoption of our tests or reduce the potential markets for our tests, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
note numbers refer to "notes to consolidated financial statements" in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
results of operations we discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014. we discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under "capital resources and liquidity." certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. within the tables presented, percentages are calculated based on the underlying whole-dollar amounts and, therefore, may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes.
outlook overall, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the worldwide contact lens and health care markets. however, events affecting the economy as a whole, including the uncertainty and instability of global markets driven by foreign currency volatility, european debt concerns, the uncertainty caused by the united kingdom's election to withdraw from the european union, and the trend of consolidation within the health care industry, impact our current performance and continue to represent a risk to our performance for fiscal year 2017.
coopervision - we compete in the worldwide contact lens market with our spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses offered in a variety of materials including using silicone hydrogel aquaform® technology and phosphorylcholine technology (pc) technologytm. we believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves and enhances the wearing experience through a combination of improved designs and materials and the growth of preferred modalities such as single-use and monthly wearing options. coopervision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration of recently introduced products and we continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets, including through acquisitions.
on august 6, 2014, we acquired sauflon pharmaceuticals limited (sauflon), a privately-held european manufacturer and distributor of soft contact lenses and aftercare solutions. the acquisition of sauflon expanded our contact lens product portfolio particularly with sauflon's clariti® 1day brand of single-use silicone hydrogel spherical, toric and multifocal lenses. on september 6, 2016, we acquired soflex, a privately-held isreali manufacturer and distributor of soft contact lenses and aftercare solutions. the acquisition of soflex expanded our market presence in israel.
sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials continue to grow and this product material represents about half of the industry. our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our desired future levels of sales growth and profitability. coopervision markets monthly and two-week silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lens products under our biofinity®, clariti® and avaira® brands and a monthly silicone hydrogel multifocal lens under biofinity. coopervision markets single-use silicone hydrogel spherical, toric and multifocal lenses under our clariti 1day brand and a single-use silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lenses under myday®.
we believe that the global market for single-use contact lenses will continue to grow and our single-use silicone hydrogel products represent an opportunity for our business. our clariti 1day brand provides the only single-use silicone hydrogel lenses in the marketplace with a complete line of spherical, toric and
43
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations multifocal contact lenses. we forecast increasing aggregate demand for clariti 1day and myday products, as well as future single-use products.
coopersurgical - our coopersurgical business competes in the general health care market with a focus on advancing the health of families through a diversified portfolio of products and services focusing on women's health, fertility and diagnostics. coopersurgical has established its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring companies and products that complement its business model. coopersurgical product sales are categorized based on the point of health care delivery including products used in medical office and surgical procedures primarily by obstetricians and gynecologists (ob/gyns) that represented 55% of coopersurgical's net sales in the fiscal 2016 compared to 66% in the prior year. coopersurgical's remaining sales are highly specialized products and services that target the in vitro fertilization (ivf) process used in fertility that now represent 45% of coopersurgical's net sales compared to 34% in fiscal 2015. this change in product mix is primarily attributable to recent acquisitions discussed below.
we have continued to invest in coopersurgical's business through the acquisition of companies and product lines for new or complementary products and services for the ivf process. subsequent to our year end, in november 2016, we acquired wallace, the ivf segment of smiths medical international, ltd. in our fiscal third quarter of 2016, we acquired the commercial assets of recombine inc., a clinical genetic testing company specializing in carrier screening; kivex biotec a/s, a manufacturer and distributor of equipment for ivf clinics, and reprogenetics uk, a genetics laboratory specializing in service offerings of preimplantation genetic screening (pgs) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) used during the ivf process. in our fiscal second quarter of 2016, coopersurgical acquired genesis genetics, inc., a genetics laboratory specializing in pgs and pgd used during the ivf process, and the pipette company, a manufacturer and distributor of micro pipettes for the assisted reproductive technology (art) market. in our first quarter of fiscal 2016, coopersurgical acquired research instruments limited, a manufacturer and supplier of ivf medical devices and systems. in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, coopersurgical acquired reprogenetics us, a genetics laboratory specializing in service offerings of pgs and pgd used during the ivf process. we intend to continue investing in coopersurgical's business with the goal of expanding our integrated solutions model within the areas of women's health, fertility and diagnostics.
capital resources - at october 31, 2016, we had $100.8 million in cash, primarily outside the united states, and $999.8 million available under our new syndicated revolving credit agreement. the $830.0 million term loan entered on march 1, 2016, $207.0 million of the $700.0 million term loan originally entered into on august 4, 2014, and $285.0 million of the $300.0 million term loan originally entered into on september 12, 2013, remain outstanding as of october 31, 2016.
on march 1, 2016, we entered into a new syndicated revolving credit and term loan agreement with keybank as administrative agent. this agreement, maturing on march 1, 2021, replaced our previous revolving credit agreement, entered into on january, 12, 2011 and provides for a multi-currency revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion and a term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $830.0 million. concurrently, we used funds from the new term loan to repay the $200.0 million outstanding principal amount of the two uncommitted revolving lines of credit, entered into on march 24, 2015 and the outstanding amounts under the previous credit agreement. we also used funds from the new term loan to partially repay outstanding amounts under the term loans entered into on august 4, 2014 and september 12, 2013, and for general corporate purposes. see note 5. debt for additional information.
on july 14, 2015, coopervision made a one-time lump sum payment to jjvc of $17.0 million to settle our existing patent disputes. as discussed in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, the settlement was royalty-free and neither party admitted any liability. on april 7, 2015, we paid all of the outstanding loan notes issued to previous holders of sauflon shares for the sauflon acquisition in the amount of $51.2 million that had been recorded in short-term debt. our current cash balance and availability under
44
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the existing credit facilities reflects the use of cash outside the united states and the use of credit facilities to fund acquisitions, including recent coopersurgical acquisitions and the $1.1 billion acquisition of sauflon in august 2014. we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operating activities and borrowing capacity under the new credit facilities will fund operations both in the next 12 months and in the longer term as well as current and long-term cash requirements for capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and cash dividends. however, depending on the size or timing of these business activities, we may seek to raise additional debt financing.

coopervision net sales the contact lens market has two major product categories:
•   spherical lenses including lenses that correct near- and farsightedness uncomplicated by more complex visual defects.
•   toric and multifocal lenses including lenses that, in addition to correcting near- and farsightedness, address more complex visual defects such as astigmatism and presbyopia by adding optical properties of cylinder and axis, which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea.

the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear, products are sold with recommended replacement schedules, often defined as modalities, with the primary modalities being single-use, two-week and monthly. coopervision offers spherical, aspherical, toric, multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities.
single-use lenses are designed for daily replacement and frequently replaced lenses are designed for two-week or monthly replacement. significantly, the market for spherical lenses is growing with value-added spherical lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms, to reduce eye fatigue from use of digital devices, to add aspherical optical properties, and/or higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels.
coopervision's silicone hydrogel biofinity brand spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses, avaira brand spherical and toric lenses and myday brand spherical and toric lenses, are manufactured using proprietary aquaform technology to increase oxygen transmissibility for longer wear. our silicone hydrogel clariti brand spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses are available in monthly and single-use modalities. we believe the clariti single-use silicone hydrogel lens products provide a competitive advantage in approved markets as clariti is the only single-use silicone hydrogel lens available in all vision correction categories - spherical, toric and multifocal.
coopervision's proclear brand aspheric, toric and multifocal contact lenses, manufactured using pc technologytm, help enhance tissue/device compatibility and offer improved lens comfort.
coopervision fiscal 2016 net sales increased 6% from fiscal 2015 to $1.58 billion. net sales growth included increases in total sphere lenses up 6%, representing 55% of net sales, the same as in the prior year, primarily on sales of biofinity, clariti, and myday lenses, offset by declines in older products. total toric lenses grew 9%, representing 30% of net sales, the same as in the prior year, predominantly on sales of biofinity and clariti products. total multifocal lenses grew 5%, representing 11% of net sales, the same as in the prior year, primarily from growth in sales of biofinity and clariti products. total silicone hydrogel products, including biofinity, clariti, myday and avaira, grew 15%, representing 60% of net sales up from 55% in the prior year.

coopervision's gross margin in fiscal 2016 remained flat compared to fiscal 2015. gross margin was impacted positively from an increase in sales of higher margin products including biofinity, offset by the negative effects of foreign currency changes that unfavorably impacted gross margin as we reported lower net sales due to the weakening of foreign currencies as compared to the united states dollar. fiscal 2016 and 2015 gross margins were negatively impacted by product and equipment rationalization charges and the related severance costs, arising from our review of sauflon's products, materials and manufacturing processes, and facility start-up costs of $65.2 million and $69.6 million, respectively.
the decrease in coopervision's gross margin in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 is primarily attributable to the negative effects of foreign currency changes, product and equipment rationalization costs and facility start-up costs. foreign currency unfavorably impacted gross margin as we reported lower net sales due to the weakening of the foreign currencies compared to the united states dollar. gross margin was negatively impacted by product and equipment rationalization charges and the related severance costs, arising from our review of sauflon's products, materials and manufacturing processes. in addition, gross margin was negatively impacted by costs associated with the start-up of new manufacturing facilities. the decrease in gross margin was partially offset by the increase in sales of higher margin products including biofinity.
coopersurgical's decrease in gross margin in fiscal 2016, compared to fiscal 2015 is primarily due to a change in product mix arising from sales of recently acquired lower margin products and services.
coopersurgical's gross margin remained flat in fiscal 2015 compared fiscal 2014, primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin products offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency as we reported lower net sales partially due to the weakening of foreign currencies compared to the united states dollar.

the decrease in coopervision's sga in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 in absolute dollars is primarily due to lower litigation settlement, legal and related lobbying costs consisting of $2.9 million in the current year compared to $19.8 million in the prior year. the litigation, legal and related lobbying costs were related to the class action complaints filed against coopervision and other contact lens manufacturers, distributors and retailers relating to upp, as well as a $17.0 million settlement made to jjvc in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. the reduction in sga expense is also due to lower sauflon restructuring and integration activities of approximately $9.0 million in fiscal 2016, compared to $24.5 million in the prior year. coopervision's sga excluding legal, restructuring and integration activities discussed above, increased due to investment in sales and marketing, including headcount, to promote our silicone hydrogel products and to reach new customers and support geographic expansion.

the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the increase in coopervision's sga in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 in absolute dollars is primarily due to operating expenses of sauflon. coopervision's sga also included approximately $24.5 million primarily for restructuring and integration costs, largely made up of professional fees and personnel related costs for transitional employees related to sauflon restructuring and integration activities. fiscal 2015 sga expenses also include $19.8 million of litigation settlement and legal costs, of which $17.0 million relates to the settlement to intellectual property claims by jjvc, as well as litigation costs relating to the class action complaints filed against coopervision and other contact lens manufacturers, distributors and retailers relating to upp.
the increase in coopersurgical's sga in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 in absolute dollars is primarily due to the inclusion of operating expenses of recently acquired companies as well as $11.3 million of acquisition and integration expenses in fiscal 2016 compared to $4.9 million in the prior year. coopersurgical continues to invest in sales activities to promote our products and to reach new customers.
the decrease in coopersurgical's sga in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 in absolute dollars is primarily due to efficiencies as a result of cost control measures partially offset by approximately $4.9 million primarily for integration costs and costs related to the acquisition of reprogenetics in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. the increase in coopersurgical's sga in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 as a percentage of net sales reflects the acquisition and acquisition costs along with lower net sales in the current year. coopersurgical continues to invest in sales activities to promote our products and to reach new customers.
the decrease in corporate sga in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year in absolute dollars is primarily due to lower share-based compensation costs and efficiencies achieved as a result of cost control measures. the decrease in corporate sga in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 in absolute dollars is due to lower share-based compensation costs, mainly attributable to the timing of grants.

the sequential increases in amortization are due primarily to amortization of intangible assets acquired in recent acquisitions by coopersurgical, the recent acquisition of soflex by coopervision in september 2016, and the acquisition of sauflon by coopervision in august 2014. the increase in coopervision's amortization expense in fiscal 2016 compared to 2015 was also due to a charge of $2.3 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2016 to write off acquired in-process research and development. we expect amortization in fiscal 2017 to be approximately $14.6 million in each of the fiscal first through fourth quarters primarily due to intangible assets acquired through our acquisitions, offset by intangible assets which we forecast to become fully amortized.

the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restructuring and integration costs during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014, in connection with the sauflon acquisition, our coopervision business unit initiated restructuring and integration activities to optimize operational synergies of the combined companies. the 2014 sauflon integration plan activities included workforce reductions, consolidation of duplicative facilities and product rationalization. as of october 31, 2016, our activities related to this restructuring and integration plan were complete. the total restructuring costs under this plan were $148.3 million, as discussed in our notes to consolidated financial statements.
in fiscal 2016, we recorded in cost of sales $56.4 million of expense, arising from production-related asset disposals, accelerated depreciation on equipment, and inventory rationalization, primarily related to older lens products, based on our review of products, materials and manufacturing processes of sauflon. we recorded in cost of sales $1.1 million of employee termination costs. we recorded in selling, general and administrative expense a reduction of $1.1 million due to a decrease in expected employee termination payments; and we recorded $0.2 million of expense for lease termination costs. in addition, coopervision incurred $10.0 million of integration costs in fiscal 2016, included in operating expenses.
in fiscal 2015, we recorded in cost of sales $57.7 million of expense, arising from production-related asset disposals and accelerated depreciation on equipment, primarily related to our hydrogel lenses, based on our review of products, materials and manufacturing processes of sauflon. we recorded in cost of sales $4.0 million of employee termination costs. we recorded in selling, general and administrative expense a reduction of $7.2 million, as a result of decreased estimates in expected employee termination costs and voluntary terminations; and we recorded $0.4 million of expense for lease termination costs. we recorded in research and development expense $0.7 million of employee termination costs. in addition, coopervision incurred $35.2 million of integration costs in fiscal 2015, included in operating expenses. see note 3. restructuring and integration costs for additional information.
we may, from time to time, decide to pursue additional restructuring activities that involve charges in future periods.

the increase in consolidated operating income in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to the increase in consolidated net sales. in addition, the company's total operating expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2016 decreased by 3% compared to fiscal 2015 which had a corresponding increase in operating income as a percentage of sales. the increase in coopervision operating income in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to decreases in expenses relating to legal, and restructuring and integration costs primarily related to sauflon, as discussed above, recorded in cost of sales and operating expenses, in addition to the $17.0 million litigation settlement made in 2015 as discussed above. coopersurgical's operating income increased in absolute dollars in fiscal 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to an increase in sales of higher margin legacy products as a result of our investment in sales and promotional activities to reach new customers as well as recently launched products, partially offset by the sales of recently acquired lower margin products and services and the increase in total operating expenses.

interest expense increased in absolute dollars in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 reflecting higher average debt as a result of debt incurred in connection with recent acquisitions. interest expense increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 reflecting higher average debt as a result of debt incurred in connection with the august 2014 acquisition of sauflon as well as higher interest rates on our revolving credit agreement as such interest rates vary based on leverage. total debt was $1.33 billion, $1.35 billion and $1.38 billion at october 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. current period debt outstanding includes the $830.0 million term loan entered on march 1, 2016, $207.0 million of the $700.0 million term loan entered into on august 4, 2014, and $285.0 million of the $300.0 million term loan entered into on september 12, 2013.

provision for income taxes we recorded income tax expense of $20.7 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $10.3 million in fiscal 2015. our effective tax rate (etr) (provision for income taxes divided by pretax income) was 7.0% for fiscal 2016, 4.8% for fiscal 2015 and 8.3% for fiscal 2014. the etr in fiscal 2016 increased in comparison to fiscal 2015 due to an increase in foreign non-deductible integration and transaction expenses, partially offset by renewal of the r&d tax credit and lower state income taxes. the etr in fiscal 2015 decreased in comparison to fiscal 2014 partially due to discrete items and integration activities.
the etr is below the united states statutory rate as a majority of our taxable income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income has decreased over recent fiscal years effectively lowering the overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we operate are significantly lower than the statutory rate in the united states.
56
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the united states federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $81.2 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 3.5% in our fiscal year 2016 compared to $72.6 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 5.6% in our fiscal year 2015. the foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates compared to the united states federal statutory rate that had the most significant impact on our provision for foreign income taxes in the fiscal years presented include the united kingdom, barbados and puerto rico. see the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
share repurchases in december 2011, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program and subsequently amended the total repurchase authorization to $500.0 million. the program has no expiration date and may be discontinued at any time. we did not repurchase any shares during fiscal 2016. during fiscal 2015, we repurchased 468 thousand shares of our common stock for $67.3 million at an average purchase price of $139.60 per share. at october 31, 2016, we had remaining authorization to repurchase about $118.4 million of our common stock. see the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
share-based compensation plans we grant various share-based compensation awards, including stock options, performance shares, restricted stock and restricted stock units. the share-based compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2016 was $29.9 million and $9.0 million, respectively, compared to $32.9 million and $10.2 million, respectively, in fiscal 2015. as of october 31, 2016, there was $72.7 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to non-vested awards: $11.3 million for stock options; $52.3 million for restricted stock units; and $9.1 million for performance shares. the unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized over weighted average remaining vesting periods of 3.5 years for nonvested stock options, 3.2 years for restricted stock units and 1.7 years for performance shares. net proceeds (payments) related to share-based compensation awards for the fiscal years ended october 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $7.2 million, $(4.8) million and $8.6 million, respectively.
we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the black-scholes valuation model, which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life, stock price volatility and other assumptions. the use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair value. the expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. if our assumption for the expected life increased by one year, the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2016 would have increased by approximately $3.50. to determine the stock price volatility, management considers implied volatility from publicly-traded options on the company's stock at the date of grant, historical volatility and other factors. if our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point, the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2016 would have increased by approximately $1.06.
we estimate stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping and adjust the rate of expected forfeitures periodically. the adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed.
we grant performance units that provide for the issuance of common stock to certain executive officers and other key employees if the company achieves specified long-term performance goals over a three-year period. we estimate the fair value of each award on the date of grant based on the current market price of our common stock. the total amount of compensation expense recognized reflects our initial assumptions
57
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the achievement of the performance goals and the estimated forfeiture rates. we review our assessment of the probability of the achievement of the performance goals each fiscal quarter. if the goals are not achieved or it is determined that achievement of the goals is not probable, previously recognized compensation expense is adjusted to reflect the expected achievement. if we determine that achievement of the goals will exceed the original assessment, additional compensation expense is recognized.

the $2.0 million decrease in inventories was primarily related to decreases in inventories from sales and write-offs of older products, partially offset by increased production to support product launches of single-use lenses including clariti and myday, and acquired inventories from coopersurgical acquisitions. our inventory months on hand (moh) were 5.6 and 6.2 at october 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our inventory moh after adjusting for product rationalization costs related to sauflon and facility start-up costs were 6.7 at october 31, 2016, representing a decrease from october 31, 2015 of 7.5 that was adjusted for product rationalization costs related to sauflon and facility start-up costs. our days sales outstanding (dso) decreased to 53 days at october 31, 2016, compared to 57 days at october 31, 2015 primarily due to increased revenue and timing of collections.
we have reviewed our needs in the united states for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings or cash of our foreign subsidiaries. we presently intend to continue to indefinitely invest all earnings and cash outside of the united states of all foreign subsidiaries to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment requirements.
operating cash flow cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 continued to be our major source of liquidity, at $509.6 million compared to $391.0 million in fiscal 2015 and $454.8 million in fiscal 2014. fiscal 2016 results include $274.9 million of net income and non-cash items primarily made up of $198.3 million related to depreciation and amortization, $29.9 million of share-based compensation and $30.6 million of charges

the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations primarily for write-off of property, plant and equipment related to sauflon restructuring, partially offset by $19.8 million related to excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. results also include changes in operating assets and liabilities, which primarily reflects the decrease in inventories of $12.2 million mainly due to product sales and older products rationalization excluding the increases related to recently acquired companies, increase in accounts receivables and other assets of $3.5 million, increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of $4.1 million, and decrease in income tax payable of $8.9 million. the $118.7 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 is primarily due to the increase in net income, favorable changes in working capital, and the negative impact in fiscal 2015 due to the $17.0 million settlement with jjvc.
fiscal 2015 results include $205.1 million of net income and non-cash items primarily made up of $191.4 million related to depreciation and amortization, $32.9 million of expense and $17.3 million of excess tax benefits both related to share-based compensation, $10.3 million related to net gains in currency translation, $42.4 million related to loss on retirement of property, plant and equipment. results also include changes in operating assets and liabilities, which primarily reflect the increases in inventories and other assets of $46.8 million, the increases in trade and other receivables of $7.3 million, and the increase of $1.2 million relating to taxes. the $63.9 million decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 is primarily due to the decrease in net income, the $17.0 million settlement with jjvc in the fiscal third quarter of 2015, and unfavorable changes in working capital.
for fiscal 2016, our primary source of cash flows provided by operating activities was cash collections from our customers for purchase of our products. our primary uses of cash flows from operating activities were for personnel and material costs along with cash payments of $23.7 million for interest.
for fiscal 2015, our primary source of cash flows provided by operating activities was cash collections from our customers for purchase of our products. our primary uses of cash flows from operating activities were for personnel and material costs along with cash payments of $14.0 million for interest, and $17.0 million settlement with jjvc.
investing cash flow cash used in investing activities of $418.8 million in fiscal 2016 was for capital expenditures of $152.6 million primarily to increase manufacturing capacity and payments of $266.1 million primarily related to coopersurgical acquisitions in fiscal 2016.
cash used in investing activities of $287.9 million in fiscal 2015 was for capital expenditures of $243.0 million primarily to increase manufacturing capacity and payments of $44.9 million related to acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of reprogenetics in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015.

the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financing cash flow the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments of debt as well as share repurchases and share-based compensation awards.
cash used in financing activities of $1.4 million in fiscal 2016 was driven by $15.0 million net repayment of debt, $12.6 million for debt acquisition costs, $3.4 million mainly related to the purchase of noncontrolling interests, $2.9 million for dividends, offset by $27.0 million in excess tax benefits and proceeds from share-based compensation awards, and $5.5 million of proceeds from construction allowance.
cash used in financing activities of $106.7 million in fiscal 2015 was driven by $67.3 million in payments for share repurchases under our existing share repurchase plan, $37.3 million from net repayments of debt, $8.1 million for purchases of noncontrolling interests, net payments of $4.8 million related to vested share-based compensation awards, a $3.2 million payment for contingent consideration, $2.9 million for dividends, and distributions of $1.1 million to noncontrolling interests. cash used in financing activities was partially offset by $17.3 million in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation awards and $0.7 million of proceeds from a construction allowance. net repayment of debt in the period includes the payment of $51.2 million to settle all the outstanding loan notes issued for the sauflon acquisition.
at october 31, 2016, we had $100.8 million in cash, predominantly outside the united states, and $999.8 million available under our 2016 credit agreement. the $830.0 million term loan entered into on march 1, 2016, $207.0 million of the $700.0 million term loan entered into on august 4, 2014, $285.0 million of the $300.0 million term loan entered into on september 12, 2013, were outstanding as of october 31, 2016. we are in compliance with our financial covenants including the interest coverage ratio at 24.27 to 1.00 and the total leverage ratio at 1.95 to 1.00. as defined in both the 2016 credit agreement and our term loan agreements, we are required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of at least 3.00 to 1.00, and a total leverage ratio of no higher than 3.75 to 1.00.
off balance sheet arrangements none.

the expected future benefit payments for pension plans through 2026 are disclosed in note 10. employee benefits.
we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, about $30.4 million of our long-term income taxes payable have been excluded from the table above. however, other long-term liabilities, included in our consolidated balance sheet, include these uncertain tax positions. see note 6. income taxes for additional information.
inflation and changing prices inflation has had no appreciable effect on our operations in the last three fiscal years.
accounting pronouncements issued and not yet adopted in october 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2016-16, income taxes (topic 740): intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory, which requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences on an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. the asu changes the timing of the recognition of the income tax consequences of non-inventory transfers which under current guidance defers the income tax consequences until the asset is sold to an outside party or otherwise recognized. the guidance for the amendments of asu 2016-16 requires companies to apply a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative catch-up adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. we are currently evaluating the impact of asu 2016-16 which is effective for the company in our fiscal year and interim periods beginning on november 1, 2018.
in march 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-09, stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to employee share-based payment accounting, which is intended to improve the accounting for share-based payment transactions as part of the fasb's simplification initiative. the asu changes the following aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: accounting for income taxes; classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows; forfeitures; minimum statutory tax withholding requirements; and classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes. we are currently evaluating the impact of asu 2016-09, which is effective for the company in our fiscal year and interim periods beginning on november 1, 2017.
62
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, leases (topic 842). asu 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. a lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. for leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. in transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. we are currently evaluating the impact of asu 2016-02, which is effective for the company in our fiscal year and interim periods beginning on november 1, 2019.
in november 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-17, balance sheet classification of deferred taxes, which requires entities to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. the amendments in the asu are effective for the company in our fiscal year and interim periods beginning on november 1, 2017. the company does not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606). asu 2014-09 requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. asu 2014-09 sets forth a new revenue recognition model that requires identifying the contract, identifying the performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to performance obligations and recognizing the revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations. the amendments in the asu can be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the update recognized at the date of the initial application along with additional disclosures. we are currently evaluating the impact of asu 2014-09, which is effective for the company in our fiscal year beginning on november 1, 2018.
accounting pronouncements recently adopted in september 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-16, business combinations: simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments (topic 850). asu 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognizes adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. the effect on earnings as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of the acquisition date, must be recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined rather than retrospectively. asu 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. the amendment should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the guidance, with early adoption permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. we elected to early adopt this guidance on a prospective basis for the quarter ended july 31, 2016.  such adoption did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial position.
in april 2015, the fasb issued accounting standards update (asu) 2015-03, interest - imputation of interest (subtopic 835-30) simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. the amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. asu 2015-03 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. early adoption is permitted. we elected to early adopt this guidance as a change in accounting principle on a retrospective basis in the fiscal first quarter ended january 31, 2016. as of january 31, 2016 and october

the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
31, 2015, we have presented debt issuance costs related to our term loans, previously reported in other assets, as direct deductions from the carrying amount of the debt liability. we also presented the debt issuance costs related to our revolving credit facility as a deferred asset within other assets, as permitted by asu 2015-15, imputation of interest, which was issued in august 2015. such adoption did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial position.
estimates and critical accounting policies management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap). we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods.
•   revenue recognition - we recognize product net sales, net of discounts, returns and rebates in accordance with related accounting standards and sec staff accounting bulletins. as required by these standards, we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned, based on terms of sale with the customer, where persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery has occurred, the seller's price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. for contact lenses as well as coopersurgical medical devices, surgical instruments, accessories, diagnostic products and services, this primarily occurs when title and risk of ownership transfers to our customers, and/or when services are rendered. we believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances, and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements. we record, based on historical statistics, estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances, rebates and specifically established customer product return programs. we record taxes collected from customers on a net basis, as these taxes are not included in net sales.
•   net realizable value of inventory - in assessing the value of inventories, we make estimates and judgments regarding aging of inventories and other relevant issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products and estimated prices at which those products will sell. on an ongoing basis, we review the carrying value of our inventory, measuring number of months on hand and other indications of saleability. we reduce the value of inventory if there are indications that the carrying value is greater than market, resulting in a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory. subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. while estimates are involved, historically, obsolescence has not been a significant factor due to long product dating and lengthy product life cycles. we target to keep, on average, five to seven months of inventory on hand to maintain high customer service levels given the complexity of our contact lens and women's health care product portfolios.
•   valuation of goodwill - we account for goodwill and evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment annually during the fiscal third quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist in accordance with related accounting standards. we performed our annual impairment test in our fiscal third quarter of 2016, and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill. we performed our annual impairment test in our fiscal third quarter of 2015 and concluded that we had no impairment of goodwill in that year.
64
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in fiscal 2016 and 2015, we performed qualitative assessments to test each reporting unit's goodwill for impairment. qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting each reporting unit. based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test will be performed.
initially, we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it. if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment. our reporting units are the same as our business segments - coopervision and coopersurgical - reflecting the way that we manage our business.
goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment. if our common stock price trades below book value per share, there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business, or a future annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill, we may have to recognize a non-cash impairment of our goodwill that could be material, and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets, stockholders' equity and financial condition.
•   business combinations - we routinely consummate business combinations. results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. we recognize separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired, including acquired in-process research and development, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date fair values as defined by accounting standards related to fair value measurements. as of the acquisition date, goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration given, generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
•   income taxes - we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets. to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates. to determine the tax rate, we are required to estimate full-year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as
65
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations they are identified. changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate, and such changes could be material.
regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. we measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized, assess the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and classify and disclose the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in the interpretation of related accounting guidance for income taxes. the interpretation also provides guidance on how the interest and penalties related to tax positions may be recorded and classified within our consolidated statement of income and presented in the consolidated balance sheet. we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense.
•   share-based compensation - we grant various share-based compensation awards, including stock options, performance unit shares, restricted stock and restricted stock units. under fair value recognition provisions, share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating cooper's stock price volatility, employee exercise behaviors and related employee forfeiture rates.
the expected life of the share-based awards is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. in determining the expected volatility, management considers implied volatility from publicly-traded options on cooper's common stock at the date of grant, historical volatility and other factors. the risk-free interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the united states treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award. the dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share, divided by the stock price at the date of grant.
as share-based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant, based on historical experience, and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of the fair value recognition provisions, the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period.

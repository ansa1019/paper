item 1a. risk factors in addition to the forward-looking statements outlined previously in this form 10-k and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties, the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business. our business, financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.
our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations, many of which are beyond our control. in addition to general u.s. economic trends, and to a lesser extent global economic trends, these factors include interference with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads; rail service delays; disruptions to u.s. port-of-call activity; significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices, fuel taxes, interest rates, insurance premiums, self-insurance levels, excess capacity in the intermodal or trucking industries, or license and registration fees; terrorist attacks or actions; acts of war; adverse weather conditions; disruption or failure of information technology systems; increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment; increased tariffs assessed on or disruptions in the procurement of imported revenue equipment; volatile financial credit markets; and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers, independent contractors, and third-party carriers.
we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers' business cycles, particularly in market segments and industries where we have a significant concentration of customers. economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss, and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt losses. in addition, our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors. customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season, and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months, primarily due to colder weather, which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs.

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business.
our jbi business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services. the majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads. while we have agreements with a number of class i railroads, the majority of our business travels on the bnsf railway company (bnsf) and the norfolk southern railways. a material change in the relationship with, the ability to utilize one or more of these railroads or the overall service levels provided by these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. in addition, a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts. work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business.
in january, 2017, we exercised our right to utilize the arbitration process to review the division of revenue collected beginning may 1, 2016, as well as to clarify other issues, under our joint service agreement with bnsf. bnsf has requested the same, and the arbitration process has commenced. bnsf provides a significant amount of rail transportation services to our jbi business segment. at this time, we are unable to reasonably predict the outcome of the arbitration, and, as such, no gain or loss contingency can be determined or recorded. normal commercial business activity between the parties, including load tendering, load tracing, billing and payments, is expected to continue on a timely basis.
we also utilize independent contractors and third-party carriers to complete our services. these third parties are subject to similar regulation requirements, which may have a more significant impact on their operations, causing them to exit the transportation industry. aside from when these third parties may use our trailing equipment to fulfill loads, we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering these loads. the inability to obtain reliable third-party carriers and independent contractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth.
rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results.
fuel costs can be very volatile. we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers, which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs. most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel. however, there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers. in addition, we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or out-of-route miles that cannot be billed to customers. rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability. as of december 31, 2016, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel-price fluctuations.
insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings.
our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. if the number or severity of claims for which we are self-insured increases, our operating results could be adversely affected. we have policies in place for 2017 with substantially the same terms as our 2016 policies for personal injury, property damage, workers' compensation, and cargo loss or damage. we purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are self-insured. if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our earnings could be materially and adversely affected.

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
for the calendar year ended december 31, 2016, our top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 29% of our revenue. our jbi, ics, and jbt segments typically do not have long-term contracts with their customers. while our dcs segment business may involve a long-term written contract, those contracts may contain cancellation clauses, and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels. a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
we operate in a regulated industry, and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.
the dot, fmcsa, and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service, equipment operation, safety, and financial reporting. we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety, hours-of-service, and other rules and regulations. if we were found to be out of compliance, the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations.
difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers and delivery personnel could affect our profitability and ability to grow.
if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees, we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package, let revenue equipment sit idle, dispose of the equipment altogether, or rely more on higher-cost third-party carriers, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability. in addition, our growth could be limited by an inability to attract third-party carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services.
we rely significantly on our information technology systems, a disruption, failure or security breach of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we rely on information technology throughout all areas of our business to initiate, track, and complete customer orders; process financial and nonfinancial data; compile results of operations for internal and external reporting; and achieve operating efficiencies and growth. our information technology systems may be susceptible to various interruptions, including equipment or network failures, failed upgrades or replacement of software, user error, power outages, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers, or other security breaches. we have mitigated our exposure to these risks through the establishment and maintenance of technology security programs and disaster recovery plans, but these mitigating activities may not be sufficient. a significant disruption, failure or security breach in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, which could include operational disruptions, loss of confidential information, external reporting delays or errors, legal claims, or damage to our business reputation.
we operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry. numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets.
we compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with ltl carriers and railroads, some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do. additionally, some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain our profit margins.
in an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses, a customer often selects so-called "core carriers" as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected. many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors. also, certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations, thereby reducing their need for our services.

extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations, impact freight volumes, and increase our costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results.
certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations. increases in the cost of our operations, such as towing and other maintenance activities, frequently occur during the winter months. natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs.
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties.
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks, and discharge and retention of storm water. we operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred. our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities. if a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item 8. this discussion contains forward-looking statements. please see "forward-looking statements" and "risk factors" for a discussion of items, uncertainties, assumptions and risks associated with these statements.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. therefore, the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates. we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following:
workers' compensation and accident costs we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries, vehicular collisions, accidents, and cargo damage. certain insurance arrangements include a level of self-insurance (deductible) coverage applicable to each claim. we have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs. we are substantially self-insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment.
the amounts of self-insurance change from time to time based on measurement dates, policy expiration dates, and claim type. we have policies in place for 2017 with substantially the same terms as our 2016 policies for personal injury, property damage, workers' compensation, and cargo loss or damage.
our claims accrual policy for all self-insured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by third-party claims administrators, as well as legal, economic, and regulatory factors. our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim. the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature, timing, and extent of damages claimed becomes available. accordingly, we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability. this process involves the use of loss-development factors based on our historical claims experience and includes a contractual premium adjustment factor, if applicable. in doing so, the recorded liability considers future claims growth and, if applicable, conversion to fully insured status and provides a reserve for incurred-but-not-reported claims. we do not discount our estimated losses. at december 31, 2016, we had an accrual of approximately $98 million for estimated claims. in addition, we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums. at december 31, 2016, we had an aggregate prepaid insurance asset of approximately $93 million, which represented prefunded premiums and deposits.
revenue equipment we operate a significant number of tractors, trucks, containers, chassis, and trailers in connection with our business. this equipment may be purchased or acquired under lease agreements. in addition, we may rent revenue equipment from various third parties under short-term rental arrangements. purchased revenue equipment is depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life to an estimated salvage or trade-in value. we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment. we have not identified any impairment to our assets at december 31, 2016.
15
we have agreements with our primary tractor suppliers for residual or trade-in values for certain new equipment. we have utilized these trade-in values, as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles, in accounting for depreciation expense. if our suppliers were unable to perform under the terms of our agreements for trade-in values, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported and as other services are provided. accordingly, a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period.
we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we are the primary obligor, we are a principal in the transaction, we invoice our customers and retain all credit risks, and we maintain discretion over pricing. additionally, we are responsible for the selection of third-party transportation providers.
our trade accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers that have been reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments. the allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical experience, as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectability. the adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly.
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method. our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in a tax deduction or taxable income in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings. deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements and when they are recognized in our tax returns. we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or the reversal of temporary timing differences. to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, a valuation allowance is established. to the extent we establish a valuation allowance, we include an expense as part of our income tax provision.
significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain tax-related contingencies on our provision for income taxes. as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes, we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. for tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is not more likely than not to be sustained in our consolidated financial statements. such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments, whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates. further, a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved. see note 7, income taxes, in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies.

2016 compared with 2015
consolidated operating revenues our total consolidated operating revenues increased 5.9% to $6.56 billion in 2016, compared to $6.19 billion in 2015, primarily due to overall increased load volume, partially offset by lower revenue per load in our jbi, ics, and jbt segments. fuel surcharge revenues decreased 18.4% to $548 million in 2016, compared to $671 million in 2015. if fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years, our 2016 revenue increased 8.9% over 2015.
consolidated operating expenses our 2016 consolidated operating expenses increased 6.6% from 2015, while year-over-year revenue increased 5.9%, resulting in a 2016 operating ratio of 89.0% compared to 88.4% in 2015. rents and purchased transportation costs increased 8.7% in 2016, primarily the result of increased rail purchased transportation rates and the increase in load volume, which increased services provided by third-party rail and truck carriers within jbi and ics segments. salaries, wages and employee benefit costs increased 5.4% in 2016 from 2015. this increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to an increase in the number of employees and a tighter supply of qualified drivers, partially offset by a $15.2 million, one-time benefit recorded to reflect a change in our employee paid time off policy.
depreciation and amortization expense increased 6.4% in 2016, primarily due to additions to our jbi segment tractor, container and chassis fleets to support additional business demand, equipment purchased related to new dcs long-term customer contracts, and new replacement equipment in jbt.
17
fuel and fuel taxes expense decreased 9.5% in 2016 compared with 2015, due to decreases in the price of fuel during 2016, partially offset by increased road miles. we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers. these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national, regional, or local fuel prices. while these programs may address fuel cost changes as frequently as weekly, most also reflect a specified miles-per-gallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue. as a result, some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues. due to these programs, this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly.
it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense, or the change of fuel expense between periods, as a significant portion of fuel cost is included in our payments to railroads, dray carriers and other third parties. these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense.
operating supplies and expenses increased 5.7%, driven primarily by increased toll activity and tire expense. general and administrative expenses increased 20.0% from 2015, primarily due to increased charitable contributions and the absence of net gains from asset sales and disposals in 2016. net losses from sale or disposal of assets were $5 million in 2016, compared to net gains of $1 million in 2015. insurance and claims expense increased 6.4% in 2016, primarily due to higher incident volume.
net interest expense for 2016 decreased by 1.1% compared with 2015, due primarily to lower effective interest rates.
our effective income tax rate was 37.90% in 2016 and 38.10% in 2015. the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to a reduction in permanent differences related to executive compensation and lower state tax rates.
segments we operated four business segments during calendar year 2016. the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to consolidated financial statements. the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment:

jbi segment jbi segment revenue increased 3.6% to $3.80 billion in 2016, from $3.66 billion in 2015. this increase in revenue was primarily a result of an 8.1% increase in load volume, offset by a 4.2% decrease in revenue per load, which is the combination of changes in freight mix, customer rates, and fuel surcharge revenue. load volume in our eastern network increased 6.7%, and transcontinental loads grew 9.0% compared to 2015. excluding fuel surcharge, revenues increased 7.1% and revenue per load decreased 1.0% in 2016 over the prior year. average length of haul remained relatively flat in 2016 when compared to 2015.
operating income of the jbi segment decreased to $450 million in 2016, from $477 million in 2015. benefits from volume growth, improved network efficiency, improved rail service, and approximately $5.7 million from the change in paid time off policy were offset by increased rail purchased transportation costs, higher equipment ownership costs, increased insurance and cargo claim expense and higher driver wage and retention costs.
dcs segment dcs segment revenue increased 5.6% to $1.53 billion in 2016, from $1.45 billion in 2015. productivity, defined as revenue per truck per week, increased 1.2% when compared to 2015. revenue, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 7.3% in 2016 compared to 2015, and productivity excluding fuel surcharge revenue increased 2.8% from 2015, primarily from improved overall operational efficiencies, including better integration of assets between customer accounts, fewer unseated trucks, increased customer supply-chain fluidity, load counts and customer rate increases. dcs ended 2016 with a net additional 193 revenue-producing trucks when compared to 2015.
operating income of our dcs segment increased to $205 million in 2016, from $163 million in 2015. the increase is primarily due to increased revenue, improved asset utilization, and approximately $7.3 million from the change in paid time off policy, partially offset by higher driver wage and recruiting costs, increased salaries and benefits expenses, and higher equipment ownership costs.
ics segment ics segment revenue increased 21.7% to $852 million in 2016, from $699 million in 2015. overall volumes increased 57.0%. revenue per load decreased 22.5% primarily due to freight mix changes driven by customer demand. contractual business was approximately 74% of the total load volume and 64% of the total revenue in the 2016, compared to 71% of the total load volume and 63% of the total revenue in 2015.
operating income remained flat at $36 million for both 2016 and 2015, primarily due to increased revenue and approximately $1.0 million from the change in paid time off policy, being offset by a 6.3% decrease in gross profit margin, increased claim costs, higher technology costs and increased personnel costs, as the total branch count increased to 42 from 34 at the end of 2015. ics gross profit margin decreased to 14.3% for 2016 from 15.3% for 2015. ics's carrier base increased 11.4%, and the employee count increased 23.0% when compared to 2015.
jbt segment jbt segment revenue increased 0.6% to $388 million in 2016, from $386 million in 2015. excluding fuel surcharges, revenue for 2016 increased 3.8% compared to 2015, primarily due to increased average truck count, partially offset by core customer rate decreases and freight mix changes.
jbt segment had operating income of $30 million in 2016 compared with $40 million in 2015. benefits from an increased average truck count, higher load volume, and approximately $1.2 million from the change in paid time off policy, were more than offset by increased driver recruiting costs, higher independent contractor cost per mile, higher safety and insurance costs, and increased tractor maintenance costs.

2015 compared with 2014
consolidated operating revenues our total consolidated operating revenues were $6.19 billion in 2015, remaining relatively flat when compared to $6.17 billion in 2014. overall customer rate increases and load growth, and increased fleet counts in our jbi, dcs, and jbt segments, were offset by a 38.0% decrease in fuel surcharge revenue to $671 million in 2015 when compared to $1.08 billion in 2014, due to decreases in the price of fuel during the year. if fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years, our 2015 revenue increased 8.5% over 2014.
consolidated operating expenses our 2015 consolidated operating expenses decreased 1.1% from 2014, while year-over-year revenue remained flat, resulting in a 2015 operating ratio of 88.4% compared to 89.8% in 2014. rents and purchased transportation costs decreased 2.9% in 2015, primarily the result of the lower fuel component in the cost of services provided by third-party rail and truck carriers within jbi, dcs, and ics segments. salaries, wages and employee benefit costs increased 8.1% in 2015 from 2014. this increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to an increase in the number of employees and a tighter supply of qualified drivers.
depreciation and amortization expense increased 15.3% in 2015, primarily due to additions to our jbi segment tractor, container and chassis fleets to support additional business demand, equipment purchased related to new dcs long-term customer contracts, and new replacement equipment in jbt.
fuel and fuel taxes expense decreased 31.0% in 2015 compared with 2014, due to decreases in the price of fuel during 2015, partially offset by increased road miles. we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers. these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national, regional or local fuel prices. while these programs may address fuel cost changes as frequently as weekly, most also reflect a specified miles-per-gallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue. as a result, some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues. due to these programs, this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly.
it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense, or the change of fuel expense between periods, as a significant portion of fuel cost is included in our payments to railroads, dray carriers and other third parties. these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense.
operating supplies and expenses increased 0.9%, driven primarily by increased toll rates and activity, partially offset by decreased general equipment maintenance and repair costs. general and administrative expenses increased 43.3% from 2014, due primarily to costs related to corporate wide streamlining and technology redevelopment efforts. net gains from sale or disposal of assets were $1 million in 2015, compared with $6 million in 2014. insurance and claims expense decreased 9.1% in 2015, primarily due to decreased accident severity and fewer incidents.
net interest expense for 2015 decreased by 5.4% compared with 2014, primarily due to lower effective interest rates.
our effective income tax rate was 38.10% in 2015 and 38.01% in 2014. the increase in 2015 was primarily related to an increase in state income tax expense.
21
jbi segment jbi segment revenue decreased 0.6% to $3.66 billion in 2015, from $3.69 billion in 2014, resulting from a decrease in revenue per load, which is attributable to customer rate increases offset by lower fuel surcharges and freight mix. this decrease was partially offset by increases in load volume in both our eastern and transcontinental networks. excluding fuel surcharge, revenues increased 8.7% and revenue per load increased 4.4% in 2015 over the prior year. average length of haul remained relatively flat in 2015 when compared to 2014.
operating income in our jbi segment increased to $477 million in 2015, from $461 million in 2014. this increase was primarily due to customer rate increases, increased load volume, reduced reliance on outsourced dray carriers, lower insurance and cargo claim costs, and lower maintenance costs, partially offset by increases in rail purchased transportation rates, higher equipment depreciation expense, higher driver procurement and retention expenses, and $6.4 million in corporate-wide streamlining and technology redevelopment costs.
dcs segment dcs segment revenue increased 4.1% to $1.45 billion in 2015, from $1.39 billion in 2014. productivity, defined as revenue per truck per week, decreased 1.7% when compared to 2014, primarily from lower fuel surcharge revenue. revenue, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 10.0% in 2015 compared to 2014, and productivity excluding fuel surcharge revenue increased 3.9% from 2014, primarily from customer rate increases and additional activity at customer accounts. dcs ended 2015 with a net additional 328 revenue-producing trucks when compared to 2014.
operating income increased to $163 million in 2015, compared with $117 million in 2014. the increase in operating income was primarily due to increased revenue, improved asset utilization, less reliance on third-party carriers and lower maintenance costs, partially offset by increased equipment depreciation expense, higher driver wage and recruiting costs, and $2.6 million in corporate-wide streamlining and technology redevelopment costs.
ics segment ics segment revenue decreased 2.6% to $699 million in 2015, from $718 million in 2014. this decrease in revenue was primarily due to decreased revenue per load resulting from lower fuel prices, changes in freight mix, and less transactional customer demand, partially offset by an increase in overall load volume. contractual business was approximately 71% of the total load volume and 63% of the total revenue in the 2015, compared to 63% of the total load volume and 55% of the total revenue in 2014.
operating income increased to $36 million in 2015, compared to $30 million in 2014, primarily due to improved gross profit margin. ics gross profit margin increased to 15.3% for 2015 from 13.0% for 2014. improvements in gross profit margin were offset by approximately $4.4 million in corporate-wide streamlining and technology redevelopment costs and higher personnel costs as the total branch count increased to 34 from 29 at the end of 2014. ics's carrier base increased 17%, and the employee count increased 15% when compared to 2014.
jbt segment jbt segment revenue remained flat at $386 million in 2015 when compared to 2014. excluding fuel surcharges, revenue for 2015 increased 7.5% compared to 2014, primarily due to increased truck count and core rate increases.
jbt segment had operating income of $40 million in 2015 compared with $24 million in 2014. benefits from an increased truck count, core rate increases, and improvements in equipment maintenance costs, insurance and claims costs, and fuel economy were partially offset by lower asset utilization, higher driver wage and hiring costs, lower gains on equipment sales, increased equipment depreciation expense, increased driver and independent contractor costs per mile, and corporate-wide streamlining and technology redevelopment costs.

liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was $854 million in 2016 and $873 million in 2015. this decrease in 2016 was primarily due to the timing of collections of trade and other receivables, partially offset by increased earnings, collection of income taxes receivable and the timing of the payments of trade payables.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $485 million in 2016, compared with $577 million in 2015. the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in equipment purchases, partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the sale of equipment in 2016, compared to 2015.
net cash used in financing activities was $368 million in 2016, compared with $297 million in 2015. this change resulted primarily from higher long-term debt repayments, net of proceeds from long-term debt, in 2016, partially offset by a reduction in treasury stock purchases.
our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors, and payments are dependent upon our financial condition, liquidity, earnings, capital requirements, and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant. we paid a $0.20 per share quarterly dividend in 2014, a $0.21 per share quarterly dividend in 2015, and a $0.22 per share quarterly dividend in 2016. on january 25, 2017, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.22 to $0.23 per share, which will be paid february 24, 2017, to stockholders of record on february 10, 2017. we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis. however, no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid.
liquidity our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of containers, chassis, trucks, tractors, and trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment. we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions. we obtain capital through cash generated from operations, revolving lines of credit, and long-term debt issuances. we have also periodically utilized capital and operating leases for revenue equipment.
at december 31, 2016, we were authorized to borrow up to $500 million under a senior revolving line of credit, which is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks and expires in september 2020. this senior credit facility allows us to request an increase in the total commitment by up to $250 million and to request a one-year extension of the maturity date. the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on the prime rate, the federal funds rate, or libor, depending upon the specific type of borrowing, plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees. at december 31, 2016, we had $140 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 1.76% under this agreement.
our senior notes consist of three separate issuances. the first and second issuances are $250 million of 2.40% senior notes due march 2019 and $250 million of 3.85% senior notes due march 2024, respectively, both of which were issued in march 2014. interest payments under both notes are due semiannually in march and september of each year. the third issuance is $350 million of 3.30% senior notes due august 2022, issued in august 2015. interest payments under this note are due semiannually in february and august of each year. we may redeem for cash some or all of these notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture. we currently have interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert our $250 million of 2.40% fixed-rate senior notes due march 2019 and our $350 million of 3.30% fixed-rate senior notes due august 2022 to variable rates, resulting in interest rates of 1.81% and 2.26%, respectively, at december 31, 2016. the applicable interest rates under these swap agreements are based on libor plus an established margin.
our financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios. we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at december 31, 2016.
we believe our liquid assets, cash generated from operations, and various financing arrangements will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future.

we are currently committed to spend approximately $967 million, net of proceeds from sales or trade-ins, during 2017 and 2018, which is primarily related to the acquisition of containers, chassis, and tractors.
off-balance sheet arrangements our only off-balance sheet arrangements are related to operating leases. as of december 31, 2016, we had approximately $36.7 million of obligations, primarily related to facility leases.

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately $4.4 million at december 31, 2016, that expire at various dates in 2017, which are related to certain operating agreements and our self-insured retention levels for casualty and workers' compensation claims. we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our third-party agreements. the table above excludes $39.8 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement. see note 7, income taxes, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

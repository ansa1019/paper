item 1a.   risk factors we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions, while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate. the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us. the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition. see also statement regarding forward-looking disclosure.
•   we operate in a highly competitive industry.
the advertising and marketing communications business is highly competitive. our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and other providers of creative, marketing or media services, to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business. our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies, but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants.
the client's perception of the quality of our agencies' creative work and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position. an agency's ability to serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services may also be an important competitive consideration. on the other hand, because an agency's principal asset is its people, freedom of entry into the industry is almost unlimited, and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client's account from a much larger competitor.
•   clients may terminate or reduce their relationships with us on short notice.
many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time, and we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions. our clients may choose to terminate their contracts, or reduce their relationships with us, on a relatively short time frame and for any reason. a relatively small number of clients contribute a significant portion of our revenue. in the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 20% of revenue in 2016. a substantial decline in a large client's advertising and marketing spending, or the loss of a significant part of its business, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations.
our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases, be limited by clients' policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest, or our own exclusivity arrangements with certain clients. these policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar services for competing products or companies.
•   our results of operations are highly susceptible to unfavorable economic conditions.
we are exposed to risks associated with weak regional or global economic conditions and increased disruption in the financial markets. the global economy continues to be volatile. uncertainty about the strength of the global economy generally, or economic conditions in certain regions, and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers, continue to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services. our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general. in the past, some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. this pattern may recur in the future. furthermore, unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues, resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins. if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions, the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations.
•   we may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel.
our employees, including creative, digital, research, media and account specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most valuable assets. an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award and other factors which may be beyond our control. changes to u.s. or other immigration policies that restrain the flow of professional talent may inhibit our ability to staff our offices or projects. in addition, the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility. if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
7
•   if our clients experience financial distress, or seek to change or delay payment terms, it could negatively affect our own financial position and results.
we have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us. the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and write-offs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, and if these effects were severe, the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets, credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity.
furthermore, in most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients. the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. to the extent possible, we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients. however, if clients are unable to pay for commitments that we have entered into on their behalf, or if clients seek to significantly delay or otherwise alter payment terms, there could be an adverse effect on our working capital, which would negatively impact our operating cash flow.
•   international business risks could adversely affect our operations.
we are a global business, with agencies located in over 100 countries, including every significant world market. operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our revenues, approximately 40% in 2016. these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation, currency variation, exchange control restrictions and difficult social, political or economic conditions. we also must comply with applicable u.s., local and other international anti-corruption laws, export controls and economic sanctions, which can be complex and stringent, in all jurisdictions where we operate. failure to comply or to implement business practices that sufficiently prevent corruption could result in significant remediation expense and expose us to significant civil and criminal penalties and reputational harm.
given our substantial operations in the united kingdom and continental europe, we face uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of the u.k.'s june 2016 referendum in which voters approved the united kingdom's exit from the european union, commonly referred to as "brexit." it is possible that brexit will cause increased regulatory and legal complexities and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including our relationships with existing and future clients, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations.
in developing countries or regions, we may face further risks, such as slower receipt of payments, nationalization, social and economic instability, currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws. these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries.
in addition, because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, such as the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, chinese yuan renminbi, euro, indian rupee and japanese yen, fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and such currencies, including the persistent strength of the u.s. dollar in recent periods, may adversely affect our financial results. in particular, brexit has caused, and may continue to cause, significant volatility in currency exchange rates, especially between the u.s. dollar and the british pound sterling.
•   we are subject to industry regulations and other legal or reputational risks that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our performance or financial condition.
our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action, both domestic and foreign. advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation, regulation, judicial actions or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare. our business is also subject to specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products. existing and proposed laws and regulations, in particular in the european union and the united states, concerning user privacy, use of personal information and on-line tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internet-based and digital marketing. legislators, agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products, such as alcohol or tobacco, and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising, which, if successful, may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients' goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and, consequently, on our revenues. furthermore, we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial.
•   we face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments.
we regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients. these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks, including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment. while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, we may be unsuccessful
8
in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity, our forecasts of the investment's future performance also factor into the initial consideration. when actual financial results differ, our returns on the investment could be adversely affected.
we may also experience difficulty integrating new employees, businesses, assets or systems into our organization, including with respect to our internal policies and required controls. we may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investment's operations. furthermore, it may take longer than anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions, or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all. talent is among our most valuable assets, and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel. acquisition and integration activity may also divert management's attention and other corporate resources from other business needs. if we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or acquisition, or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.
•   we rely extensively on information technology systems and could face cybersecurity risks.
we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business, including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information, developing new business opportunities and digital products, and processing business transactions. the incidence of malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities is on the rise worldwide. power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities or human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis, with a large number of agencies and legal entities, and the resulting size, diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase our potential vulnerability to such breakdowns, malicious intrusions or attacks.
likewise, data privacy breaches, as well as improper use of social media, by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information, strategic plans and trade secrets, could be exposed to third parties or to the general public. we operate worldwide, and the legal rules governing data transfers are often complex, conflicting, unclear or ever-changing. we also utilize third parties, including third-party "cloud" computing services, to store, transfer or process data, and system failures or network disruptions or breaches in the systems of such third parties could adversely affect our reputation or business.
any such breaches or breakdowns could expose us to legal liability, be expensive to remedy, result in a loss of our or our clients' or vendors' proprietary information and damage our reputation. efforts to develop, implement and maintain security measures are costly, may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated.
•   our earnings would be adversely affected if we were required to recognize asset impairment charges or increase our deferred tax valuation allowances.
we evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable. if certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance.
as of december 31, 2016, we have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet, including approximately $3.7 billion of goodwill. future events, including our financial performance, market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies, loss of a significant client's business or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired. any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized. for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets, see "critical accounting estimates" in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
•   we may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones.
from time to time, we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance. they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance. our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them. see statement regarding forward-looking disclosure.
9
•   our financial condition could be adversely affected if our available liquidity is insufficient.
we maintain a $1 billion committed credit facility (the "credit agreement") to increase our financial flexibility. if credit under the credit agreement were unavailable or insufficient, our liquidity could be adversely affected. the credit agreement contains financial covenants, and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them. for example, compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues, a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges. if we were unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement, we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders, and our costs under the credit agreement could increase. if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver, the credit agreement could be terminated, and any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration.
furthermore, if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook, see "liquidity and capital resources" in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
•   downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us.
because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness, including covenants and interest rates, we could be adversely affected if our credit ratings were downgraded or if they were significantly weaker than those of our competitors. our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity.
•   the costs of compliance with sustainability or other social responsibility laws, regulations or policies, including client-driven policies and standards, could adversely affect our business.
although as a non-manufacturing service business we generally are not directly impacted by current laws and regulations with respect to climate change and other sustainability concerns, we could incur related costs indirectly through our clients. increasingly our clients request that we comply with their own social responsibility, sustainability or other business policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us. our compliance with these policies and related certification requirements could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business relationships or reputation. further, if clients' costs are adversely affected by climate change or related laws and regulations, this could negatively impact their spending on our advertising and marketing services. we could also face increased prices from our own suppliers that face climate change-related costs and that seek to pass on their increased costs to their customers.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to help you understand the interpublic group of companies, inc. and its subsidiaries (the "company," "ipg," "we," "us" or "our"). md&a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this report. our md&a includes the following sections:
executive summary provides a discussion about our strategic outlook, factors influencing our business and an overview of our results of operations and liquidity.
results of operations provides an analysis of the consolidated and segment results of operations for 2016 compared to 2015 and 2015 compared to 2014.
liquidity and capital resources provides an overview of our cash flows, funding requirements, contractual obligations, financing and sources of funds, and debt credit ratings.
critical accounting estimates provides a discussion of our accounting policies that require critical judgment, assumptions and estimates.
recent accounting standards, by reference to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, provides a discussion of certain accounting standards that have been adopted during 2016 or that have not yet been required to be implemented and may be applicable to our future operations.
executive summary our organic revenue increase in 2016 was driven by growth throughout all our geographic regions, which was a result of growth with existing clients and net new business wins. the growth in our domestic market was across nearly all of our major disciplines. our international organic increase was across all disciplines, with notable contributions from the united kingdom, the latin america region and continental europe. we continued to have strong growth in demand for our full range of services, including creative, digital, media and marketing services across most of our regional markets. we carefully managed our operating expenses, which reflected investments made in our agencies to support our new business portfolio, service our existing clients and grow our capabilities.
overall demand for our services by clients remains solid, though with challenging economic conditions in some parts of the world, marketers continue to show a measure of caution. we continue to derive substantial benefit from our diversified client base, our global footprint and the broad range and strength of our professional offerings. we continued to enhance our businesses during 2016 by making investments in creative and strategic talent that emphasize our growth priorities: fast-growth digital marketing channels, high-growth geographic regions, creative talent and strategic world markets. we believe our continued investment in tools, technology and process improvements will create efficiencies in the delivery of our services.
we continued to enhance value to our shareholders through common stock dividends, share repurchases and improvements in our balance sheet. basic earnings per share available to ipg common stockholders for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $1.53, $1.11 and $1.14 per share, respectively. diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $1.49, $1.09 and $1.12 per share, respectively. basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2016 included a net positive impact of $0.23 and $0.22 per share, respectively, from various tax items as discussed in further detail in the "income taxes" and "earnings per share" sections of our md&a. both basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2016 included a negative impact of $0.10 per share from the losses on sales of businesses due to completed dispositions and the classification of certain assets as held for sale. both basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2015 included a negative impact of $0.12 per share from the losses on sales of businesses due to completed dispositions and the classification of certain assets as held for sale. both basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2014 included a positive impact of $0.16 per share from the net reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in continental europe. basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2014 also included a negative impact of $0.01 and $0.02 per share, respectively, from the loss on early extinguishment of debt, net of tax.

when we analyze period-to-period changes in our operating performance, we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to changes in foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, and the remainder we call organic change, which indicates how our underlying business performed. the performance metrics that we use to evaluate our results include the organic change in revenue, salaries and related expenses, and office and general expenses, and the components of operating expenses expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenue. additionally, in certain of our discussions we analyze revenue by geographic region and also by business sector, in which we focus on our top 100 clients, which typically constitute approximately 55% to 60% of our annual consolidated revenues.
the change in our operating performance attributable to changes in foreign currency rates is determined by converting the prior-period reported results using the current-period exchange rates and comparing these prior-period adjusted amounts to the prior-period reported results. although the u.s. dollar is our reporting currency, a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies. therefore, our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses. our exposure is mitigated as the majority of our revenues and expenses in any given market are generally denominated in the same currency. both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the u.s. dollar affect our consolidated results of operations, and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact on us related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region. the foreign currencies that most impacted our results during 2016 included the british pound sterling and, to a lesser extent, the argentine peso, brazilian real and japanese yen.
for purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred. during the past few years, we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (continued)
(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)
results of operations consolidated results of operations revenue our revenue is directly impacted by the retention and spending levels of existing clients and by our ability to win new clients. most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue. our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter. this reflects the seasonal spending of our clients, incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter. in the events marketing business, revenues can fluctuate due to the timing of completed projects, as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete. when we act as principal for these projects, we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue, and the related costs are incurred as pass-through costs in office and general expenses.

in 2016, our change in revenue of 3.1% from 2015 outpaced an increase in total operating expenses of 2.5%, resulting in operating margin expansion to 12.0% from 11.5%. in 2015, our change in revenue of 1.0% from 2014, compared with a decrease in total operating expenses of 0.1%, resulting in operating margin expansion to 11.5% from 10.5%. our operating income grew 7.6% in 2016 to $938.0, and 10.6% in 2015 to $871.9.
salaries and related expenses salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs, employee performance incentives, including annual bonus and long-term incentive awards, costs for temporary workers, severance and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff. salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with short-term changes in revenue levels; however, salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of the hiring of personnel, including freelancers, to support revenue growth and changes in the performance levels and types of employee incentive awards. additionally, we may take severance actions in areas where we have or anticipate decreases in operating performance or to enhance our teams or leadership. changes in our incentive awards mix can impact future-period expense, as annual bonus awards are expensed during the year in which they are earned, and long-term incentive awards are expensed over the performance period, generally three years. factors impacting long-term incentive awards are the actual number of awards vesting, assumptions regarding forfeiture rates, the change in our stock price, actual results and changes to our projected results, which could impact the achievement of certain performance targets.

net interest expense for 2016, net interest expense increased by $7.5 as compared to 2015, primarily due to increased cash interest expense from uncommitted credit lines in order to meet working capital needs.
for 2015, net interest expense increased by $5.5 as compared to 2014, primarily due to lower interest income in the current year. cash interest expense decreased primarily due to the retirement of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014 (the "6.25% notes") in the second quarter of 2014, partially offset by the issuance of our 4.20% senior notes due 2024 (the "4.20% notes") in the second quarter of 2014. non-cash interest expense increased primarily due to revaluations of mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests.
other expense, net results of operations include certain items that are not directly associated with our revenue-producing operations.

our tax rates are affected by many factors, including our worldwide earnings from various countries, changes in legislation and tax characteristics of our income. in 2016, our effective income tax rate of 23.8% was positively impacted by a benefit of $44.6 related to refunds to be claimed on future amended u.s. federal returns for tax years 2014 and 2015 primarily related to foreign tax credits and, to a lesser extent, research and development credits based on the conclusion of multi-year studies; the

settlement of 2011 and 2012 income tax audits, which included the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits of $23.4; the reversal of valuation allowances of $12.2 as a consequence of the disposition of certain businesses in continental europe; $10.4 related to the adoption of the financial accounting standards board (the "fasb") accounting standards update 2016-09, stock compensation; and various changes in state income tax laws as well as the recognition of previously unrecognized state tax benefits as a result of a lapse in statute of limitations. the positive impacts to our tax rates were partially offset by a revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of a statutory tax rate change in continental europe, losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances and by losses on sales of businesses for which we did not receive a full tax benefit.
in 2015, our effective income tax rate of 37.1% was negatively impacted primarily by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances and from the losses on sales of businesses for which we did not receive a full tax benefit. the negative impacts to our tax rates were partially offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the reversal of valuation allowances in continental europe and the settlement of a 2010 income tax audit.
in 2014, our effective income tax rate of 30.0% was positively impacted from changes to our valuations allowances of $66.0. the primary drivers of the net change were associated with a valuation allowance reversal of $124.8 in one jurisdiction partially offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance of $57.2 in another jurisdiction, both in continental europe. in addition, our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances.

the timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow. in most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients. to the extent possible, we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients. the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these pass-through arrangements, while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers.
our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments. for example, while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year, they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year.

investing activities net cash used in investing activities during 2016 primarily consisted of payments for capital expenditures of $200.7, related mostly to leasehold improvements and computer hardware and software, and payments for acquisitions of $52.0, net of cash acquired.
net cash used in investing activities during 2015 primarily related to payments for capital expenditures of $161.1, largely attributable to purchases of leasehold improvements and computer hardware.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities during 2016 is primarily driven by the repurchase of 13.3 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $303.3, including fees, and the payment of dividends of $238.4 on our common stock.
net cash used in financing activities during 2015 primarily related to the repurchase of our common stock and payment of dividends. we repurchased 13.6 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $285.2, including fees, and made dividend payments of $195.5 on our common stock.
foreign exchange rate changes the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in an increase of $11.6 in 2016, primarily a result of the u.s. dollar being weaker than the brazilian real as of december 31, 2016 compared to december 31, 2015.
the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in a decrease of $156.1 in 2015. the decrease was primarily a result of the u.s. dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies, including the australian dollar, brazilian real, canadian dollar, euro and south african rand as of december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014.

liquidity outlook we expect our cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months. we also have a committed corporate credit facility as well as uncommitted facilities available to support our operating needs. we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to managing liquidity, with flexibility over significant uses of cash, including our capital expenditures, cash used for new acquisitions, our common stock repurchase program and our common stock dividends.
from time to time, we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional funds or otherwise improve our liquidity profile, enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk. our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors, which include those specific to us, such as our credit rating, and those related to the financial markets, such as the amount or terms of available credit. there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
funding requirements our most significant funding requirements include our operations, non-cancelable operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, common stock dividends, taxes and debt service. additionally, we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options to sell us their equity interests.
25

(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)
notable funding requirements include:
•   debt service - our 2.25% senior notes in aggregate principal amount of $300.0 mature on november 15, 2017, and a $22.6 note classified within our other notes payable is due on june 30, 2017. we expect to use available cash to fund the retirement of the outstanding notes upon maturity. the remainder of our debt is primarily long-term, with maturities scheduled through 2024. see the table below for the maturity schedule of our long-term debt.
•   acquisitions - we paid cash of $52.1, net of cash acquired of $13.6, for acquisitions completed in 2016. we also paid $0.5 in up-front payments and $59.3 in deferred payments for prior-year acquisitions as well as ownership increases in our consolidated subsidiaries. in addition to potential cash expenditures for new acquisitions, we expect to pay approximately $77.0 in 2017 related to prior-year acquisitions. we may also be required to pay approximately $31.0 in 2017 related to put options held by minority shareholders if exercised. we will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to grow and continue to strengthen our market position, particularly in our digital and marketing services offerings, and to expand our presence in high-growth and key strategic world markets.
•   dividends - during 2016, we paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.15 per share on our common stock, which corresponded to aggregate dividend payments of $238.4. on february 10, 2017, we announced that our board of directors (the "board") had declared a common stock cash dividend of $0.18 per share, payable on march 15, 2017 to holders of record as of the close of business on march 1, 2017. assuming we pay a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share and there is no significant change in the number of outstanding shares as of december 31, 2016, we would expect to pay approximately $280.0 over the next twelve months.
the following summarizes our estimated contractual cash obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2016 and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods.

2   non-cancelable operating lease obligations are presented net of future receipts on contractual sublease arrangements.
3   we have structured certain acquisitions with additional contingent purchase price obligations based on factors including future performance of the acquired entity. see note 4 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
4   the amounts presented are estimates due to inherent uncertainty of tax settlements, including the ability to offset liabilities with tax loss carryforwards.
share repurchase program in february 2016, the board authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $300.0, excluding fees, of our common stock (the "2016 share repurchase program"), which was in addition to the remaining amount available to be repurchased from the $300.0 authorization made by the board in february 2015 (the "2015 share repurchase program"). we fully utilized the 2015 share repurchase program during the third quarter of 2016. as of december 31, 2016, $155.4 remained available for repurchase under the 2016 share repurchase program.
on february 10, 2017, we announced that our board had approved a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $300.0, excluding fees, of our common stock (the "2017 share repurchase program"). the new authorization is in addition to any amounts remaining for repurchase under the 2016 share repurchase program. there is no expiration date associated with the share repurchase programs.
we may effect such repurchases through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with sec rules, derivative transactions or other means. we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock in future periods, although the timing and amount of the repurchases will depend on market conditions and other funding requirements.

financing and sources of funds substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies. our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world, primarily at the holding company level and at our largest subsidiaries. below is a summary of our sources of liquidity.

1   we are required from time to time to post letters of credit, primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries. these letters of credit historically have not been drawn upon.
at december 31, 2016, we held $698.0 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in foreign subsidiaries. we have not provided u.s. federal income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we consider such earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the united states. if in the future we distribute these amounts to the united states, an additional provision for the u.s. income and foreign withholding taxes, net of foreign tax credits, could be necessary.
credit agreements we maintain a committed corporate credit facility to increase our financial flexibility, which has been amended and restated from time to time (the "credit agreement"). the credit agreement is a revolving facility, expiring in october 2020, under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the credit agreement may be repaid and reborrowed, subject to an aggregate lending limit of $1,000.0, or the equivalent in other currencies. the company has the ability to increase the commitments under the credit agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to $250.0, provided the company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions. the aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase, subject to a sublimit on letters of credit of $200.0 or the equivalent in other currencies. we use our credit agreement to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries. our obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured.
under the credit agreement, we can elect to receive advances bearing interest based on either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate (each as defined in the credit agreement) plus an applicable margin that is determined based on our credit ratings. as of december 31, 2016, the applicable margin was 0.10% for base rate advances and 1.10% for eurocurrency rate advances. letter of credit fees accrue on the average daily aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding, at a rate equal to the applicable margin for eurocurrency rate advances, and fronting fees accrue on the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at an annual rate of 0.25%. we also pay a facility fee at an annual rate that is determined based on our credit ratings, which as of december 31, 2016, was 0.15% on the aggregate lending commitment under the credit agreement.
the table below sets forth the financial covenants in effect as of december 31, 2016.

1   the interest coverage ratio is defined as ebitda, as defined in the credit agreement, to net interest expense. the leverage ratio is defined as debt as of the last day of such fiscal quarter to ebitda for the four quarters then ended.
as of december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all of our covenants in the credit agreement. if we were unable to comply with our covenants in the future, we would seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders, but there is no assurance that our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver. if we were unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver, the credit facility could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal. in addition, under those circumstances we could be required to deposit funds with one of our lenders in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility.

we also have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates. as of december 31, 2016, there were borrowings under some of the uncommitted facilities to manage working capital needs. we have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries. if we lose access to these credit lines, we would have to provide funding directly to some of our international operations. the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted credit facilities was approximately 3% as of december 31, 2016 and 2015.
cash pooling we aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis. outside the united states, we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements. in these pooling arrangements, several ipg agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of set-off against amounts other agencies owe the bank, and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreed-upon level. typically, each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances. our consolidated balance sheets reflect cash, net of bank overdrafts, under all of our pooling arrangements, and as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 the amounts netted were $1,300.6 and $1,608.3, respectively.
debt credit ratings our long-term debt credit ratings as of february 10, 2017 are listed below.
moody's investorsservice   s&amp;p global ratings   fitch ratings rating    baa2                       bbb-                     bbb outlook   stable                     positive                 positive we are rated investment-grade by moody's investors service, s&p global ratings and fitch ratings. the most recent updates to our credit ratings occurred in july 2016 when fitch ratings revised our outlook from 'stable' to 'positive' and in april 2016 when moody's investors service upgraded our rating from baa3 to baa2 and s&p global ratings revised our outlook from 'stable' to 'positive'. a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency. the rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating. credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity, either adverse or favorable, including, among other things, because they could affect funding costs in the capital markets or otherwise. for example, our credit agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a credit ratings grid.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes. our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. we believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following critical accounting estimates involve management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our consolidated financial statements. management has discussed with our audit committee the development, selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates. we regularly evaluate our judgments, assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
revenue recognition our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multi-channel advertising, marketing and communications programs around the world. most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and, accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly. our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits. our largest clients are multinational entities, and, as such, we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies. in arranging for such services, it is possible that we will enter into global, regional and local agreements. agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved. critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements.
revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectability is reasonably assured; and (iv) services have been performed.
28
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (continued)
(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)
depending on the terms of a client contract, fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways: proportional performance (input or output), straight-line (or monthly basis) or completed contract.
depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three. commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication. contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to either qualitative or quantitative goals, or both. performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client. the classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments. if the judgments change there can be a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods.
the majority of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less pass-through expenses charged to a client. in most cases, the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our consolidated financial statements because of various pass-through expenses, such as production and media costs. we assess whether our agency or the third-party supplier is the primary obligor, and we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment. in addition, we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price, discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor. because we operate broadly as an advertising agency, based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis, we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting. accordingly, we generally record revenue net of pass-through charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business. in those businesses where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal (primarily sales promotion and event, sports and entertainment marketing), we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as office and general expenses. in general, we also report revenue net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenue-producing transactions.
as we provide services as part of our core operations, we generally incur incidental expenses, which, in practice, are commonly referred to as "out-of-pocket" expenses. these expenses often include expenses related to airfare, mileage, hotel stays, out-of-town meals and telecommunication charges. we record the reimbursements received for such incidental expenses as revenue with a corresponding offset to office and general expense.
the determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments. if we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our reported results. if it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues, have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin.
we receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that, based on the terms of our contracts and local law, are either remitted to our clients or retained by us. if amounts are to be passed through to clients, they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or, if retained by us, are recorded as revenue when earned.
in may 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance on revenue recognition which requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. we expect to adopt the standard, which is effective january 1, 2018, using the full retrospective method; however, that determination is subject to the completion of our analysis of certain items. while we continue to assess all potential impacts of the standard, based upon our initial assessment, we currently expect an impact to the timing of revenue recognition between quarters primarily as a result of estimating variable consideration. we are still assessing whether the standard will result in a change in the number of performance obligations within our contractual arrangements, and what impact, if any, the standard will have on our assessment of principal versus agent in connection with media buying, production and studio work, and our events businesses. additionally, under the new standard certain out-of-pocket expenses reimbursed by our clients will no longer be recorded in revenue.
income taxes the provision for income taxes includes u.s. federal, state, local and foreign taxes. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of change.
we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets, which is primarily dependent on future earnings. a valuation allowance shall be recognized when, based on available evidence, it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of the
29
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (continued)
(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)
deferred tax assets will not be realized. the factors used in assessing valuation allowances include all available evidence, such as past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. in circumstances where there is negative evidence, establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered. we believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three-year period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance. conversely, a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance. further, in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists, projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence, to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment. accordingly, the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings.
the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement reporting of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return. additionally, guidance is provided for de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. the assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments. we evaluate our tax positions using the "more likely than not" recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold. we have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation. we regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require.
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method, which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including projections of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples. considering the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets, as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent. as a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets.
we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of october 1st each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level. we have 11 reporting units that were subject to the 2016 annual impairment testing. our annual impairment review as of october 1, 2016 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units.
in performing our annual impairment review, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is "more likely than not" that the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. qualitative factors to consider may include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings, financial performance, and other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy or clients, as well as pending litigation. if, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances such as those described above, an entity determines that it is "more likely than not" that the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is required to determine the fair value and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value. otherwise, no additional testing is required.
for reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment, or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as "more likely than not" that the fair value is less than its carrying value, the first step of the quantitative impairment test is performed. for our annual impairment test, we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units' equity to the carrying value of their net assets. the first step is a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. the sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium. goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired, and no further testing is required. should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the first step of the quantitative impairment test is failed, and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step, which is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value. the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value, excluding goodwill. impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified.
for our 2016 and 2015 annual impairment tests, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for seven and ten reporting units and performed the first step of a two-step quantitative impairment test for four and two reporting units, respectively. for the qualitative analysis we took into consideration all the relevant events and circumstances, including financial performance, macroeconomic conditions and entity-specific factors such as client wins and losses. based on this assessment, we have concluded

that for each of our reporting units subject to the qualitative assessment, it is not "more likely than not" that its fair value was less than its carrying value; therefore, no additional testing was required.
the 2016 and 2015 fair values of reporting units for which we performed quantitative impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data. we generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for our analysis. for the income approach, we used projections, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions. factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures projections, assumed tax rates, discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management. for the market approach, we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparable-company market multiples.
these estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit. the discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit. for the 2016 test, the discount rate we used for our reporting units tested were between 9.5% and 11.0%, and the terminal value growth rate for all four reporting units tested was 3.0%. the terminal value growth rate represents the expected long-term growth rate for the advertising and marketing services industry, incorporating the type of services the reporting unit provides, and the global economy. for the 2016 test, the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between 3.0% and 5.0%. factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients, the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit. we believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period. actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material. a deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions, significant client losses, changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future.
we also perform a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test. our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit, where the low end of the range increases discount rates by 0.5%, and the high end of the range decreases discount rates by 0.5%. we use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the quantitative impairment test.
the table below displays the midpoint of the fair value range for each reporting unit tested in the 2016 and 2015 annual impairment tests, indicating that the fair value exceeded the carrying value for all reporting units by greater than 20%. when factoring in a 0.5% increase in discount rate, our results of the 2016 and 2015 tests indicate that the fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 20% for all reporting units, except for reporting unit b whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 17.5% in 2016.

d                       $4.9                 &gt; 115%
based on the analysis described above, for the reporting units for which we performed the first step of the quantitative impairment test, we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of october 1, 2016, because these reporting units passed the first step of the test as the fair values of each of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values.
we review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets. these assets are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value. impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified. intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7 and 15 years. events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client, the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting

unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations.
pension and postretirement benefit plans we use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets, which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events.
the discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. we determine our discount rates for our domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans and significant foreign pension plans based on either a bond selection/settlement approach or bond yield curve approach. using the bond selection/settlement approach, we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments. using the bond yield curve approach, we determine the discount rate by matching the plans' cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve. both approaches utilize high-quality aa-rated corporate bonds and the plans' projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments, which is then used to develop a single discount rate. in countries where markets for high-quality long-term aa corporate bonds are not well developed, a portfolio of long-term government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields, which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate.
the discount rate used to calculate net pension and postretirement benefit costs is determined at the beginning of each year. for the year ended december 31, 2016, discount rates of 4.80% for the domestic pension plan and 4.65% for the postretirement benefit plan and a weighted-average discount rate of 3.61% for the significant foreign pension plans were used to calculate 2016 net pension and postretirement benefit costs. a 25 basis-point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2016 net pension and postretirement benefit cost by approximately $0.4.
the discount rate used to measure our benefit obligations is determined at the end of each year. as of december 31, 2016, we used discount rates of 4.20% for the domestic pension plan and 4.05% for the domestic postretirement benefit plan and a weighted-average discount rate of 2.52% for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations. a 25 basis-point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the december 31, 2016 benefit obligation by approximately $26.0 and $28.0, respectively.
the expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year. our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions, current and expected market conditions, risk premiums associated with asset classes and long-term inflation rates. we determine both a short-term and long-term view and then select a long-term rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities.
for 2016, the weighted-average expected rates of return of 7.00% and 5.38% were used in the calculation of net pension costs for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans, respectively. for 2017, we plan to use expected rates of return of 7.00% and 4.66% for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans, respectively. changes in the rates are typically due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held. a lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension cost. a 25 basis-point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2016 net pension cost by approximately $1.0.

item 1a.  risk factors our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.
visibility into our markets is limited. our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. a large amount of our orders are back-end loaded toward the end of our second and fourth fiscal quarters and their timing may be influenced by the sales incentive programs we have in place. in addition, our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets. however, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect. any decline in our customers' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. also, if our customers' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.
15
if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer.
we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. in addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal. without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:
•   properly identify customer needs and predict future needs;
•   innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;
•   successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;
•   manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time;
•   differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings;
•   price our products competitively;
•   anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and
•   control product quality in our manufacturing process.
general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the united states. slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in:
•   reduced demand for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations;
•   increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;
•   increased price pressure for our products and services; and
•   greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.
failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income.
our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate. the sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products. during a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. in the past we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products. in addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. in addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. in order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. if demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses.
demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers, research and development budgets and on government funding policies.
our customers include pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, mergers and consolidations, spending priorities, institutional and governmental budgetary policies and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, consolidation, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. the timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast, including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services. if demand for our products and services is adversely affected, our revenue and operating results would suffer.
16
economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.
because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. international revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenues by approximately 2 percentage points in the year ended october 31, 2016. in addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states. accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:
•   interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;
•   changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
•   changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions;
•   trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;
•   negative consequences from changes in tax laws including changes to u.s. tax legislation that could materially increase our effective tax rate;
•   difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;
•   differing labor regulations;
•   differing protection of intellectual property;
•   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and
•   geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.
we centralized most of our accounting and tax processes to two locations: india and malaysia. these processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable, accounts receivables and tax functions. if conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.
additionally, we must comply with complex foreign and u.s. laws and regulations, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-competition regulations and sanctions imposed by the u.s. office of foreign assets control and other similar laws and regulations. violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.
in addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in u.s. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve-month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business, operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. however, for expenses beyond that twelve-month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. in addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties. the weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.
17
our strategic initiatives could have long-term adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions.
we have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar activities in the future. these strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management, could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. in addition, delays in implementing our strategic initiatives, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions. any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements.
our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.
our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. the markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. we believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. however, there is an intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees.
our acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures, exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.
in the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. in addition, we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio. as a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term. we may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines. transactions such as acquisitions have resulted, and may in the future result, in unexpected significant costs and expenses. in the future, we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, up to the full amount of the value of the assets, or, in the case of strategic investments and alliances, consolidate results, including losses, of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment. in addition, acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected, the retention of key employees and the retention of key customers.
the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.
a successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. in addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other agilent products. in exiting a business, we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses. all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price.
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls. in our annual report on form 10-k for our fiscal year ended october 31, 2015, management concluded that, because of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting for income taxes, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of october 31, 2015. we remediated the material weakness for income tax as of october 31, 2016. however, we cannot be certain that we will be able to
18
prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.
integrating dako a/s may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and our business and financial condition may be materially impaired.
we may not achieve the desired benefits from our acquisition and integration of dako. in addition, the operation of dako within agilent may be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to:
•   our response to significant competitive pressure;
•   difficulties in meeting new product timelines;
•   the ability to grow in emerging markets;
•   increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements;
•   increased costs to address certain governmental regulations and compliance issues, such as the u.s. food and drug administration ("fda") warning letter received in august 2013 which has now been lifted by the fda;
•   increased costs and use of resources; and
•   difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures, practices and sales and distribution methodologies, as well as in the assimilation and retention of geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel.
even if we are able to successfully operate dako within agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected. as a result, the dako acquisition and integration may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction.
our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
our customers and we are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. these regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations. any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. in addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. we develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. if demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our business would suffer.
our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the international standards organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the fda. we also must comply with work safety rules. if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.
we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
a number of our products are subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. in addition, a number of our products may in the future be subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. these regulations govern a wide variety of product-related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. if we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters, adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. any such fda or other regulatory
19
agency actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.
some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business.
some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the u.s. environmental protection agency ("epa") under the toxic substances control act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws. the toxic substances control act regulations govern, among other similar things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals. the toxic substances control act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the united states that has not been reviewed by epa for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an epa inventory of chemical substances. we must ensure conformance of the manufacturing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. if we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be subject to civil penalties, criminal prosecution and, in some cases, prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.
our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations.
we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to u.s., state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations, and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, or suspension from future government contracting. if our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.
our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.
we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations. the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations, and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.
the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.
the life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.
if we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted.
although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have been consolidating, and may continue to consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. if we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.
because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements. if, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet
20
product demand, we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. by contrast, if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income, margins, and operating results.
dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain, including logistics and third-party package delivery services, may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.
as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. for example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. if one or more of the third-party package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, our costs could increase and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. in addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology ("it") and other administrative functions. since it is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. in addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price. much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.
environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved, and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.
certain properties transferred to keysight technologies, inc. ("keysight") as part of the separation are undergoing remediation by hp inc. and hewlett-packard enterprise (formerly hewlett-packard company) (together "hp") for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from hp. hp has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify keysight with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. hp will have access to those keysight properties to perform remediation. while hp has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require keysight to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. we cannot be sure that keysight will not seek additional reimbursement from us for that interference or unreimbursed costs. we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations, in which case keysight may seek indemnification from us. in addition, the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us prior to the separation could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation.
other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by hp, we have agreed to indemnify hp, with respect to any liability associated with contamination from past operations, and keysight, with respect to any liability associated with contamination prior to the separation, at, respectively, properties transferred from hp to us and properties transferred by us to keysight. while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties, subsurface contamination may exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination.
our current and historical manufacturing processes involve, or have involved, the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. as a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. while we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to avago technologies ltd. and advantest corporation and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties, we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses. although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the united states, even if the sites outside the united states are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.
as part of our acquisition of varian, inc. ("varian") we assumed the liabilities of varian, including varian's costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters. one such cost is our obligation, along with the obligation of varian semiconductor equipment associates, inc. ("vsea") to each indemnify varian medical systems, inc. ("vms") for certain costs relating to (a) environmental
21
investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by varian associates, inc. ("vai") and third-party claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities, and (b) epa or third-party claims alleging that vai or vms is a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980, as amended, in connection with certain sites to which vai allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling, treatment or disposal. although any ultimate liability arising from environmental-related matters could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, could be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered unlikely. based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, management believes that the costs of environmental-related matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
regulations related to "conflict minerals" may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.
we are subject to the rules of the securities and exchange commission ("sec") which require disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. the rule, which requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the sec by may 31st of each year, requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country. there are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. in addition, our ongoing implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tin, tantalum, gold and tungsten. the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. in addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. as our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.
from time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all.
third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. we rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results.
our pending patent applications, and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. in addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.
we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our
22
intellectual property rights quickly or at all. in some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. in addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property.
changes in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
we are subject to income taxes in both the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions. governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations from time to time. any changes in corporate income tax laws relating to transfer pricing or repatriation of capital, any changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations, or any implementation of tax laws relating to proposals to curb base erosion and profit shifting or proposals for fundamental u.s. and foreign corporate tax reform, could lead to increases in overall tax liability, which could materially impact our effective tax rate and have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations. we are also subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the u.s. internal revenue service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. these assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation. intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. a difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.
agilent benefits from tax incentives extended to its foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. several jurisdictions have granted agilent tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. the incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment, or specific types of income. agilent's taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. if agilent cannot or does not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. as a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives.
we have substantial cash requirements in the united states while most of our cash is generated outside of the united states. the failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the united states could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
although the cash generated in the united states from our operations should cover our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements, a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as the maturity of our debt obligations, our stock repurchase program, our declared dividends and acquisitions of third parties. our business operating results, financial condition, and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our u.s. cash requirements through the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost.
we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.
we currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $1.9 billion in senior unsecured notes. we also are party to a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in september 2019.  on june 9, 2015, we increased the commitments under the existing credit facility by $300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total $700 million and retained a provision that allows us to further increase commitments to the credit facility by $300 million in the aggregate, subject to certain conditions. as of october 31, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding under the facility. we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, other future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.
our incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:

•   increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;
•   requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends; and
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.
our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. in addition, the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.
if we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.
our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. in particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. our production facilities, headquarters and agilent technologies laboratories in california, and our production facilities in japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. if such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. in addition, since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. also, our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance. if our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.
if we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.
we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration, software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time. if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. in addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.
adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.
as of october 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2,289 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our results and financial condition.

we could incur significant liability if the distribution of keysight common stock to our shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.
we have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of keysight qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(d) of the internal revenue code. the opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from keysight and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, we have received, the irs could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. if the separation is determined to be taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes, our shareholders that are subject to u.s. federal income tax and we could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities.
we may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation with keysight.
we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with keysight to govern the separation and the relationship of the two companies going forward. these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us. the indemnity rights we have against keysight under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us. in addition, our indemnity obligations to keysight may be significant and these risks could negatively affect our financial condition.
we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.
since the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock. the timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, estimated cash needs, earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, as well as limitations in our contractual agreements, applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant. a change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.

overview and executive summary agilent technologies inc. ("we", "agilent" or the "company"), incorporated in delaware in may 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that includes instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.
in november 2015, we completed the acquisition of seahorse bioscience ("seahorse"), a leader in providing instruments and assay kits for measuring cell metabolism and bioenergetics for $242 million in cash. seahorse's technology enables researchers to better understand cell health, function and signaling, and how the cell may be impacted by the introduction of a specific drug, by providing real-time kinetics to unlock essential cellular bioenergetics data. the financial results of seahorse have been included within agilent's consolidated financial statements from november 1, 2015.
on march 2, 2016, agilent made a preferred stock investment in lasergen for $80 million. agilent's initial ownership stake was 48 percent and we have also joined the board of lasergen and signed a collaboration agreement. we have the option to acquire all of the remaining shares of lasergen until march 2, 2018, for additional consideration of $105 million. lasergen is a variable interest entity ("vie"), however, we do not consolidate the entity in our financial statements because we do not have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance nor are we the primary beneficiary. because of the nature of the preferred stock of lasergen that we own, we account for this investment under the cost method.
on august 1, 2016 we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of ilab solutions llc ("ilab"), a cloud-based solutions provider for core laboratory management.  ilab's offerings enables customers to easily and accurately book time in shared facilities, to bill and invoice for projects, to manage studies, to generate reports and business intelligence, and to schedule instrument reservations across multiple projects. the purchase price was $26 million in cash. the financial results of ilab have been included within agilent's consolidated financial statements from august 1, 2016.
agilent's net revenue of $4,202 million in 2016 increased 4 percent when compared to 2015. foreign currency movements for 2016 had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points compared to 2015. agilent's net revenue of $4,038 million was flat in 2015 when compared to 2014.
the life sciences and applied markets business brings together agilent's analytical laboratory instrumentation and informatics. revenue increased 1 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015. foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points in 2016 when compared to 2015. for the year ended october 31, 2016 and excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, acquisitions and the nmr business our performance within the life sciences market continued to show strong revenue growth from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets. within the applied markets, and excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and the nmr business, there was strong growth in both the environmental and food markets, but revenue from sales to other applied markets was weak with a decline in revenue from sales to the chemical and energy markets. revenue decreased 2 percent in 2015 when compared to 2014. for the year ended october 31, 2015 and
30
excluding the impact of currency movements and the nmr business, our performance within the life sciences business showed consistent revenue growth from sales to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market partially offset by a decrease in the revenue generated from sales to the life sciences research market. within applied markets and excluding the impact of currency movements and the nmr business, there was weakness in the chemical and energy markets in the year ended october 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year.
the diagnostics and genomics business includes genomics, nucleic acid contract manufacturing and the pathology, companion diagnostics and reagent partnership businesses. revenue increased 7 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015. foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage points in 2016 when compared to 2015. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and acquisitions, growth in revenue from sales to the diagnostics and clinical markets continued to be strong, led by our companion diagnostics and genomics businesses in the year ended october 31, 2016 when compared to the prior year. revenue was flat in 2015 when compared to 2014. excluding foreign currency movements, our growth in revenue from sales to the diagnostics and clinical markets was strong in the year ended october 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year.
the agilent crosslab business combines our analytical laboratory services and consumables business. revenue increased 7 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015. foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points in 2016 when compared to 2015. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and acquisitions, there was growth in sales to all key markets. the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets led all the markets in revenue and revenue growth along with very strong revenue growth from the food markets. in addition, we saw moderate growth from the environmental market and modest revenue growth from the chemical and energy markets. revenue increased 2 percent in 2015 when compared to 2014. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements there was growth in sales to all key end markets, in particular, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market in the year ended october 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year. within the applied markets revenue in chemical and energy end markets were slower but still reported growth when adjusted for currency movements.
net income from continuing operations was $462 million in 2016 compared to net income from continuing operations of $438 million and $232 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. as of october 31, 2016 and 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents balances of $2,289 million and $2,003 million, respectively.
on november 22, 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program. the existing program is designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million diluted shares. for the years ended october 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 we repurchased 2.4 million shares for $98 million, 6 million shares for $267 million and 4 million shares for $200 million, respectively. all such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method.
on may 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the "2015 repurchase program"). the 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock through and including november 1, 2018. the 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. during the year ended october 31, 2016, upon the completion of our previous repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 8.3 million shares for $336 million under this authorization. all such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method.
for the years ended october 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 cash dividends of $150 million, $133 million and $176 million were paid on the company's outstanding common stock, respectively. on november 16, 2016, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.132 per share of common stock, or approximately $43 million which will be paid on january 25, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on january 3, 2017. the timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.
looking forward, we expect to continue to focus on the growth of the operating margin in our businesses by simplifying our operations, differentiating product solutions and improving our customer's experience. we anticipate returning a significant proportion of our cash flow to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. end market growth outlook in today's uncertain political and economic environment is unpredictable and challenging. however, we expect continued strength in the pharmaceutical markets and solid growth in the food and environmental markets but we remain uncertain about the growth in the chemical and energy markets. the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 2 percentage points for the year ended october 31, 2016. costs and expenses, incurred in local currency, were subject to the favorable effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates reducing our overall net exposure. the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements can be positive or negative in any period and is calculated by applying the prior period foreign currency exchange rates to the current year period. we anticipate that changes in foreign currency exchange rates
31
will continue to have an unfavorable impact on our performance for the near future.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes.
revenue recognition.    we enter into agreements to sell products (hardware or software), services, and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. revenue from product sales, net of trade discounts and allowances, is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. revenue is reduced for estimated product returns, when appropriate. for sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. for products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete. otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete. revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. we allocate revenue to each element in our multiple-element arrangements based upon their relative selling prices. we determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy. the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence (vsoe) if available, third-party evidence (tpe) if vsoe is not available, or estimated selling price (esp) if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible product's essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules. revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements.
we use vsoe of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists. vsoe of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately. tpe of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors, it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish tpe. esp represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis. we determine esp for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including, but not limited to customer type, geography, market conditions, competitive landscape, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by management. we may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future. as these pricing strategies evolve changes may occur in esp. the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements, which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement.
inventory valuation.    we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. in the fourth quarter of 2014, agilent announced it is exiting the nmr business, and as a result, recorded an excess inventory charge of $30 million. for the year ended october 31, 2015 and 2016 additional excess inventory charges were recorded in respect of the exiting of the nmr business of $4 million and $2 million, respectively.
32
share-based compensation.    we account for share-based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance. under the authoritative guidance, share-based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value and is recognized on a straight line basis. the fair value of share-based awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the black-scholes option pricing model. no stock options were granted in 2016. shares granted under the long-term performance program based on total shareholders return ("ltpp-tsr") were valued using the monte carlo simulation model. the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards and ltpp based on operating margin ("ltpp-om") is determined based on the market price of agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield. the compensation cost for ltpp (om) reflects the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period. the employee stock purchase plan ("espp") allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date. all awards granted in 2016 to our senior management employees have a one year post-vest holding restriction and the value of these awards are adjusted for this.
both the black-scholes and monte carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the option's expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. no options were granted in 2016. due to the separation of keysight on november 1, 2014, expected volatility for grants of options in 2015 was based on a 5.5 year average historical stock price volatility of a group of our peer companies. we believe our historical volatility prior to the separation of keysight is no longer relevant.  in developing our estimated life of our employee stock options of 5.8 years for 2014, we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our executive employees who were granted the majority of the options in the annual grants, which we believed was representative of future behavior. see note 4, "share-based compensation," to the consolidated financial statements for more information. for the grants awarded under the 2009 stock plan after november 1, 2010, we increased the period available to retirement eligible employees to exercise their options from three years at retirement date to the full contractual term of ten years.
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results.
in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, the company elected to early adopt new guidance that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. for additional details related to the new guidance see note 2, "new accounting pronouncements."
retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions.    retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. other important assumptions include, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. we evaluate these assumptions at least annually.
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date - october 31 for both u.s. and non-u.s. plans. for 2015 and 2016, the u.s. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. in 2016, discount rates for the u.s. plans decreased 75 basis points from the previous year. for 2016 and 2015, the discount rate for non-u.s. plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2016, decreased 60 basis points to 110 basis points from the previous year. if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would be less than $1 million on u.s. pension expense and $16 million on non-u.s. pension expense. lower discount rates increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense.
the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. for u.s. plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. for most non-u.s. plans and u.s. post-retirement benefit plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. the expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. plan assets are valued at fair value. if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be $4 million on u.s. pension expense and $7 million on non-u.s. pension expense. for 2016, actual return on assets was below expectations which, along with contributions during the year, increased next year's pension cost as well as resulting in a degradation of the funded status at year end. the net
33
periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded in continuing operations were $3 million in 2016, $26 million in 2015 and $15 million in 2014. the year ended october 31, 2016, included a $16 million gain on curtailment and settlement.
goodwill and purchased intangible assets. under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. the accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the two-step test is necessary. if an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. otherwise, no further testing will be required.
the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. these include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers.
if it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. in the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. the second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. as defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. we aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units.
in fiscal year 2016, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and agilent crosslab. we performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units, as of september 30, 2016. based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these reporting units are greater than their respective carrying values. each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. in-process research and development ("ipr&d") is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. when the ipr&d project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. if an ipr&d project is abandoned, agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to agilent's consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.
agilent's indefinite-lived intangible assets are ipr&d intangible assets. the accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. we performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of september 30, 2016. based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values. each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible asset is indicated. in the years ended october 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded an impairment of $4 million, $3 million and $4 million, respectively, due to the cancellation of certain ipr&d projects. in addition, in the year ended october 31, 2014, we also recorded $12 million of impairment of other intangibles due to the exit of our nmr business.
accounting for income taxes. we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.
significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. when it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets
34
that cannot be realized. we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. we consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we released the valuation allowance for the majority of our u.s. deferred tax assets. at october 31, 2016, we continue to recognize a valuation allowance for certain u.s. and u.s state and foreign deferred tax assets. we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal.
we have not provided for all u.s. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely. should we decide to remit this income to the u.s. in a future period, our provision for income taxes will increase materially in that period.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all u.s. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.
as a part of our accounting for business combinations, intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible and therefore deferred tax liabilities have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations.
adoption of new pronouncements see note 2, "new accounting pronouncements," to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.
foreign currency our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 2 percentage points for the year ended october 31, 2016 and 6 percentage points for the year ended october 31, 2015. costs and expenses, incurred in local currency, were subject to the favorable effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the years ended october 31, 2016 and 2015, reducing our overall net exposure. the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements can be positive or negative in any period and is calculated by applying the prior period foreign currency exchange rates to the current year period. we hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling twelve-month period). therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. to the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, agilent may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the u.s. dollar cost of the transaction.

total gross margin for the year ended october 31, 2016 increased 2 percentage points when compared to last year. increases in total gross margins for the year ended october 31, 2016 were as a result of the exit of the nmr business, several margin improvement initiatives, lower logistics costs, lower costs to address the now lifted fda warning letter offset by increased wages and variable pay. total gross margins for the year ended october 31, 2015 increased 2 percentage points when compared the prior year. increases in total gross margins for the year ended october 31, 2015 were the result of lower intangible asset amortization, favorable product mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency movements and wage increases.
total operating margin increased 2 percentage points for the year ended october 31, 2016, when compared to last year. operating margins increased due to improvements in gross margin and the impact of an employee pension curtailment gain offset by the increased acquisition and integrations costs, the impairment charge for investment-related loans and increased wages and variable pay. total operating margins increased 3 percentage points for the year ended october 31, 2015, when compared to last year. operating margins improved due to increased gross margins and reduced expenses on lower revenue compared to last year.
gross inventory charges, included in continuing operations, were $20 million in 2016, $30 million in 2015 and $46 million in 2014. sales of previously written down inventory, included in continuing operations, were $9 million in 2016, $13 million in 2015 and $8 million in 2014.
our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software, systems and solutions, life sciences and diagnostics. in each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. most of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production, focus on major new product releases, and develop new product segments for the future. due to

the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses, there are a number of drivers of this expense. we remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share.
research and development expenses was relatively flat for the year ended october 31, 2016 when compared with last year. research and development expenditures increased by a $4 million in-process research and development (ipr&d) impairment charge mostly offset by the impact of an employee pension curtailment gain. research and development expenses decreased 8 percent for the year ended october 31, 2015 when compared with last year. r&d expenditure decreased due to the impact of foreign currency movements, savings from the exit from the nmr business and transformation initiatives, offset by wage increases.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to acquisition and integration costs related to recently acquired businesses, higher wages and variable pay and an impairment charge related to equity method investment loans offset by the impact of an employee pension curtailment gain. selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. there were increases in expenditure mostly due to the impact of wage increases, higher commissions and costs associated with business improvement and transformation initiatives more than offset by favorable foreign currency movements and the decline in nmr expenses due to the exiting of that business together with a decrease in pre separation expenses related to the separation of keysight.
interest expense for the years ended october 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $72 million, $66 million and $110 million, respectively, and relates to the interest charged on our senior notes and the amortization of the deferred loss recorded upon termination of the forward starting interest rate swap contracts offset by the amortization of deferred gains recorded upon termination of interest rate swap contracts. the decrease in interest expense in 2015 compared with 2014 is due to debt redemptions as part of the debt repositioning as a result of the separation of the keysight business.
at october 31, 2016, our headcount was approximately 12,500 compared to 11,800 in 2015.
other income (expense), net for the year ended october 31, 2016 other income (expense), net includes an $18 million expense related to the impairment of an investment and $12 million of income in respect of the provision of certain site service costs to, and lease income from, keysight. the costs associated with these services are reported within income from operations. agilent expects to receive lease income and site service income from keysight over the next 3-4 years of approximately $12 million per year. for the year ended october 31, 2015, other income (expense), net included $25 million of income in respect of the provision of certain it and site service costs to, and lease income from, keysight. for the year ended october 31, 2014 other income (expense) net, included a net loss on the early redemption of senior notes of $89 million.

for 2016, the company's effective tax rate from continuing operations was 15.1 percent. the income tax expense from continuing operations was $82 million. the income tax provision from continuing operations for the year ended october 31, 2016 included net discrete tax expense of $17 million. the net discrete tax expense for the year ended october 31, 2016, included $5 million of tax benefit for the extension of the u.s. research and development tax credit attributable to the company's prior fiscal year, $6 million of tax expense related to the curtailment gain recognized with respect to the u.s. retirement plan and supplemental benefits plan, $18 million of tax expense related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on an equity method impairment that would generate a capital loss when realized, and a net $2 million of other discrete tax benefit. included in the net $2 million discrete tax benefit are $9 million of out-of-period correcting tax expense entries recorded in the second and fourth quarters of the fiscal year of 2016 associated with german return-to-provision corrections. these are offset by an $11 million out-of-period tax benefit associated with an adjustment to the deferred tax liability for unremitted foreign earnings. the out-of-period corrections were determined to be immaterial to the previously issued and current period financial statements.
for 2015, the company's effective tax rate from continuing operations was 8.7 percent. the income tax expense from continuing operations was $42 million. the income tax benefit for the year ended october 31, 2015 included a net discrete benefit
38
of $55 million primarily due to the settlement of an internal revenue service ("irs") audit in the u.s. and the recognition of tax expense related to the repatriation of dividends.
for 2014, the company's effective tax rate from continuing operations was (1.3) percent. the income tax benefit from continuing operations was $3 million. the income tax benefit for the year ended october 31, 2014 included a net discrete benefit of $33 million primarily due to the settlement of an internal revenue service ("irs") audit in the u.s. and the recognition of tax expense related to the repatriation of dividends.
agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in singapore. the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. the tax holidays are due for renewal between 2018 and 2023. as a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $86 million, $65 million, and $27 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. the benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.26, $0.19, and $0.08 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all u.s. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.
on november 1, 2014, agilent transferred deferred tax assets of $237 million, deferred tax liabilities of $37 million, current income tax payable of $40 million, and other long-term liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling $8 million to keysight as part of its separation from agilent. a current prepaid income tax asset of $19 million and long-term prepaid income tax asset of $3 million related to sales of intercompany assets was also transferred to keysight upon separation from agilent. in addition, for the year ended october 31, 2015, a $6 million return to provision adjustment for keysight associated with bonus depreciation was recognized through retained earnings.
in the u.s., tax years remain open back to the year 2012 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states. on september 22, 2015, we reached an agreement with the internal revenue service ("irs") for the tax years 2008 through 2011. during the first quarter of 2016, we made a payment of approximately $9 million of tax plus interest as part of closing the exam. in 2015, we reclassified a portion of other long-term liabilities to other accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions of continuing operations that we expected to pay within the next twelve months. this amount was partially offset by a prepaid tax account of approximately $3 million that the irs allowed as an offset to the $12 million in incremental taxes. the settlement resulted in the recognition, within the continuing operations, of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $119 million, offset by a tax liability on foreign distributions of approximately $99 million principally related to the repatriation of foreign earnings.
on january 29, 2014, we reached an agreement with the irs for the tax years 2006 through 2007. the settlement resulted in the recognition, within the continuing operations, of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $111 million, offset by a tax liability on foreign distributions of approximately $75 million principally related to the repatriation of foreign earnings.
in other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2003. with these jurisdictions and the u.s., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.
on july 27, 2015, the u.s. tax court issued an opinion in altera corp. v. commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. a final decision was entered by the u.s. tax court on december 1, 2015. at this time, the u.s. department of the treasury has not withdrawn the requirement from its regulations to include stock-based compensation. the irs notified the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit on february 19, 2016 of its intent to appeal the tax court's decision in the case. we concluded that no adjustment to our consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time due to the uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution of this case.

life science and applied markets business revenue in 2016 increased 1 percent compared to 2015. foreign currency movements for 2016 had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points on revenue growth when compared to the same period last year. geographically, revenue declined 6 percent in the americas with a 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact. revenue declined 8 percent in europe with a 4 percentage point unfavorable currency impact. revenue grew 7 percent in japan with an 8 percentage point favorable currency impact. revenue grew 14 percent in asia pacific excluding japan with a 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact. strong growth in china led the geographic portfolio during 2016, and helped offset softness in the americas and europe. liquid chromatography products revenue continued solid growth on strength in the pharmaceutical market. revenue from mass spectrometry had instances of strength, particularly in china, which were offset by continued declines in revenue in the chemical and energy markets as well as diagnostic and clinical market declines in the americas. life science and applied markets business revenue in 2015 decreased 2 percent compared to 2014. during 2015 we exited the research products business, which reduced overall life sciences and applied markets growth by 2 percentage points. product revenue results were otherwise solid across the rest of the product portfolio. strength in the americas and europe pharmaceutical business were offset by softness in applied markets and life science research.
end market performance reflected mixed growth across markets in 2016. pharmaceutical market growth continued to be robust in 2016 driven by continuing technology refresh programs. the growth led the way for life sciences and diagnostics markets, which were offset somewhat by lower diagnostic and clinical sales, notably in the us related to a slowdown in pain management related sales. food and environmental markets, driven by strong sales in china, were areas of good growth in an otherwise weak applied market sector. chemical and energy markets continued their declines throughout 2016 as oil prices remain low. markets were also mixed for 2015 with pharmaceutical growth offset by delayed capital spending in life science research markets, and chemical and energy weakness from low oil prices.
looking forward, we are optimistic about our growth opportunities in the life sciences and applied markets as our broad portfolio of products and solutions are well suited to address customer needs. we expect strong sales funnels given a number of significant new product introductions in the next few quarters as we continue to invest in expanding and improving our applications and solutions portfolio. we remain concerned about short term prospects in chemical and energy markets, but are confident in our product portfolio to address customer needs when the market does recover.

off balance sheet arrangements and other we have contractual commitments for non-cancelable operating leases. see note 15, "commitments and contingencies", to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancelable operating leases.
our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.
contractual commitments our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. as a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.
the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31, 2016 for agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions):
less than oneyear      one to three years         three to five years        more than five years operating leases                                                $38              $60                        $22                        $26
commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers             359           3                             -                          -
other purchase commitments                                       62              -                          -                          -
retirement plans                                                 45              -                          -                          -
total                                                          $504              $63                        $22                        $26
operating leases.    commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property, see note 15, "commitments and contingencies".
commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers.    we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. during the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. the above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received. however, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year.
in addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers, in the past we recorded a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory. as of october 31, 2016, the liability for our firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was less than $1 million compared to $5 million, as of october 31, 2015 and $10 million as of october 31, 2014. these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.
other purchase commitments.    we have categorized "other purchase commitments" related to contracts with professional services suppliers. typically, we can cancel contracts without penalties. for those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, we are disclosing the termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contact's termination period before such contract can be cancelled. our contractual obligations with these suppliers under "other purchase commitments" were approximately $62 million within the next year.
retirement plans.    commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit plans and to our post-retirement medical plans for the next year only. contributions after next year are impractical to estimate.
we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of october 31, 2016 or october 31, 2015.

on balance sheet arrangements the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31, 2016 related to our long-term debt and interest expense (in millions):
less than oneyear                 one to three years            three to five years           more than five years senior notes       $-                                     $100                           $500                         $1,300
interest expense   77                      144                            116                            106
total              $77                                    $244                           $616                         $1,406
other long-term liabilities include $190 million and $227 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of october 31, 2016 and october 31, 2015, respectively. we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. however, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement.

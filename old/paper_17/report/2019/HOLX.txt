item 1a. risk factors in evaluating our business, the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission should be considered carefully. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business. the occurrence of any of these events or circumstances could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flow or results of operations. this report contains forward-looking statements; please refer to the cautionary statements made under the heading "special note regarding forward-looking statements" for more information on the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements.
risks relating to our business the continuing worldwide macroeconomic and political uncertainty, as well as existing tariffs and trade wars, may adversely affect our business and prospects, both domestically and internationally.
continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long-term and wide-spread recession and geopolitical issues have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for economic growth around the world. uncertainty about global economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets and countries with government-sponsored healthcare systems, may cause decreased demand for our products and services and increased competition, which could result in lower sales volume and downward pressure on the prices for our products, longer sales cycles, and slower adoption of new technologies. a weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers, which could result in interruptions in supply.
market acceptance of our medical products in the u.s. and other countries is dependent upon the medical equipment purchasing and procurement practices of our customers, patient need for our products and procedures, the reimbursement of patients' medical expenses by government healthcare programs and third-party payors. the continuing uncertainty surrounding global economic conditions and financial markets may cause the purchasers of medical equipment to decrease their medical equipment purchasing and procurement activities. economic uncertainty as well as increasing health insurance premiums, co-payments and deductibles may continue to result in cost-conscious consumers making fewer elective trips to their physicians and specialists, which in turn would adversely affect demand for our products and procedures. furthermore, governments and other third-party payors around the world facing tightening budgets could move to further reduce the reimbursement rates or the scope of coverage offered, which could adversely affect sales of our products. also, the elective nature of the medical aesthetics procedures subjects our business to increased volatility due to macroeconomic conditions.
changes in policy in the u.s. and other countries regarding international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements, could also negatively impact our business. in 2018 and 2019, the u.s. imposed tariffs on goods imported from china and certain other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries. additional tariffs or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response, could affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products, prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
the impending exit of the united kingdom ("uk") from the european union ("eu") (commonly known as "brexit"), has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the uk and the eu. until the terms of the uk's exit from the eu are determined, including any transition period, it is difficult to predict its impact. for example, as a result of brexit, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges. we have a manufacturing facility in the uk, and, depending on the terms of brexit, we could become subject to export tariffs and regulatory restrictions that could increase the costs and time related to doing business in europe. we have increased inventories of certain products and components in anticipation of brexit, which has impacted our financial results. additionally, brexit could result in the uk or the eu significantly altering its regulations affecting the clearance or approval of our products that are developed or manufactured in the uk. any new regulations could add time and expense to the conduct of our business, as well as the process by which our products receive regulatory approval in the uk, the eu and elsewhere. given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what economic, financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the uk from the eu would have and how such withdrawal may affect us.
our international sales are often denominated in foreign currencies, including the euro, uk pound and renminbi. changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the increase in the value of the dollar against any such foreign currencies, may reduce the reported value of our revenues outside the u.s and associated cash flows and our ability to compete effectively in foreign markets. in addition, such fluctuations can also result in foreign currency exchange losses. we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates, the impact of exchange rate changes, nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes. we currently have limited hedging arrangements in place to mitigate some of the impact of negative exchange rates.
there is also uncertainty surrounding u.s. presidential and congressional elections in 2020 and the impact on existing and future healthcare legislation. while we cannot predict the outcome of the elections or any resulting legislative changes, such changes could have a material impact on our business.
our long-term success will depend upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new products, enhance our existing products and integrate acquired businesses.
the markets for our products have been characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions and evolving customer requirements. our growth depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new indications for or enhancements of existing products, either through internal research and development or through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures or licensing or other arrangements with third parties.
the development of new products and enhancement of existing products requires significant investment in research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs, innovate and develop new products, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory clearances and approvals and reimbursement in the u.s. and abroad, manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, obtain, maintain, protect and enforce appropriate intellectual property protection for our products, gain and maintain market approval of our products and access capital. if we are not able to successfully enhance existing products or develop new products, our products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology. we cannot assure that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance, and we may be unable to recover all or a meaningful part of our investment in such products and technologies.
additionally, as part of our long-term strategy, we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities to further expand our presence in or diversify into priority growth areas by accessing new products and technologies. we may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, consummate transactions or obtain agreements with favorable terms. further, once we acquire a business, any inability to successfully integrate the business, decreases in customer loyalty or product orders, failure to retain and develop the acquired workforce, failure to establish and maintain appropriate controls or unknown or contingent liabilities could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. the integration of an acquired business whether or not successful, requires significant efforts which may result in additional expenses and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel from other projects. these transactions are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any past or future transaction will be successful. for example, we were unable to achieve our anticipated benefits and results following our acquisition of cynosure (our medical aesthetics business), and as a result, we recorded impairment charges in excess of $1.4 billion, in the aggregate, in fiscal 2018 and 2019.
if we are successful in pursuing future acquisitions, we may be required to expend significant funds, incur additional debt or other obligations, or issue additional securities, which may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. if we spend significant funds or incur additional debt or other obligations, our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could be adversely affected, and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we complete.
if we fail to develop, successfully manufacture and launch new products, enhance existing products or identify, acquire and integrate complementary businesses and products, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely affected.
if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities, on a timely basis, at acceptable costs and in compliance with regulatory and quality requirements, our ability to sell our products and our business will be harmed.
the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and requires precise high quality manufacturing that is difficult to achieve. we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing our products on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities. these difficulties have primarily related to delays and difficulties associated with ramping up production of newly introduced products and may result in increased delivery lead-times and increased costs of manufacturing these products. in addition, production of these newer products may require the development of new manufacturing technologies and expertise, which we may be unable to develop. our failure, including the failure of our contract manufacturers, to achieve and maintain the required high manufacturing standards could result in further delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns, product recalls or withdrawals, increased warranty costs or other problems that could harm our business and prospects.
in determining the required quantities of our products and the manufacturing schedule, we must make significant judgments and estimates based on historical experience, inventory levels, current market trends and other related factors
(including the anticipation of brexit). there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of products we and our distributors require, which could harm our business and results of operations.
in addition, maintaining compliance with multiple regulators, and multiple centers within the fda, adds complexity and cost to our manufacturing processes. our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to periodic regulatory inspections by the fda and other regulatory agencies, and these facilities are subject to the fda's quality system regulation and good manufacturing practices. we or our contractors may fail to satisfy these regulatory requirements in the future, and any failure to do so may prevent us from selling our products.
if, despite internal testing and testing by customers, any of our products contain errors or defects or fail to meet applicable specifications, then we may be required to enhance or improve those products or technologies. we may not be able to do so on a timely basis, if at all, and may only be able to do so at considerable expense.
additionally, a government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects, including defects in labeling. any recall could divert managerial and financial resources, be difficult and costly to correct, result in the suspension of sales of certain of our products, harm our reputation and the reputation of our products and adversely affect our business and prospects.
our reliance on one third-party manufacturer for certain of our product lines and a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials, components and subassemblies for our products exposes us to increased risks associated with production delays, delivery schedules, manufacturing capability, quality control, quality assurance and costs.
we have sole source third-party manufacturers for each of our panther and tigris molecular diagnostics instruments and for our skeletal health products. similarly, we rely on one or a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products due to cost, quality, expertise or other considerations. for example, we rely on a single source supplier for alexandrite rods used in the lasers for our elite and picosure systems, our smartcool cooling systems for our sculpsure laser system and the slt ii laser system that we integrate with our own proprietary software and delivery systems for our smartlipo triplex, cellulaze and precisiontx systems. we have no firm long-term volume commitments with certain of our sole source suppliers, including the manufacturers of our panther or tigris instruments.
similarly, we rely on one or a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials for our products due to cost, quality, expertise or other considerations, and some of these suppliers are competitors. for example, f. hoffmann-laroche ltd, a direct competitor of our diagnostics business, is the parent company of roche diagnostics corporation, our current supplier of certain key raw materials for certain of our amplified nat diagnostic assays. ge healthcare bio-sciences corp., an affiliate of ge, supplies us with the membranes used in connection with our thinprep product line. ge is a direct competitor with our breast health and skeletal health businesses.
if any of sole source manufacturers or suppliers, or our other of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers, experiences delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in its development or manufacturing operations or becomes insolvent or otherwise fails to supply us with goods in sufficient quantities, then shipments to our customers could be delayed, which would decrease our revenues and harm our competitive position and reputation. moreover, the failure of a supplier to provide sufficient quantities, acceptable quality and timely delivery of goods at an acceptable price, or an interruption in the delivery of goods from such a supplier could adversely affect our business and results of operations. obtaining alternative sources of supply of products, components, subassemblies or raw materials could involve significant delays and other costs and regulatory challenges and may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all.
we may in the future need to find new contract manufacturers or suppliers to replace existing manufacturers or suppliers, increase our volumes or reduce our costs. we may not be able to find contract manufacturers or suppliers that meet our needs, including regulatory requirements, and even if we do, the process of qualifying such alternative manufacturers and suppliers is often expensive and time consuming. as a result, we may lose revenues and our customer relationships may suffer.
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.
we constantly monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete, and we continue to assess the key personnel that we believe are essential to our long-term success. if we fail to effectively manage our ongoing organizational and strategic changes, our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation, as well as our ability to successfully attract, motivate and retain key employees, could be harmed. additionally, facilitating seamless leadership transitions for key positions is a critical factor in sustaining the success of an organization. if our succession planning efforts are not effective, it could adversely impact our business.
moreover, in our industry, there is substantial competition for key personnel in the regions in which we operate and we may face increased competition for such employees. the loss of any of our key personnel, particularly management or key research and development personnel, could harm our business and prospects and could impede the achievement of our research and development, operational or strategic objectives. our success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain other qualified managerial and technical personnel. competition for such personnel is intense. we may not be able to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business.
we face intense competition from other companies and may not be able to compete successfully.
the markets in which we sell our products are intensely competitive, subject to rapid technological change and may be significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants, and these competitive pressures may reduce our gross margins. other companies may develop products that are superior to and/or less expensive than our products. improvements in existing competitive products or the introduction of new competitive products may reduce our ability to compete for sales, particularly if those competitive products demonstrate better safety or effectiveness, clinical results, ease of use or lower costs.
some companies may have significant competitive advantages over us, which may make them more attractive to hospitals, radiology clients, group purchasing organizations, laboratories, and physicians. such competitive advantages may include:
•   greater brand recognition;
•   larger or more established distribution networks and customer bases;
•   a broader product portfolio, resulting in the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage;
•   higher levels of automation and greater installed bases of such equipment;
•   more extensive research, development, sales, marketing, and manufacturing capabilities and greater financial resources; and
•   greater technical resources positioning them to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry.
the current environment of managed care, economically motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, together with current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures, may put additional competitive pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and market sizes. if we are unable to compete effectively against existing and future competitors and existing and future alternative products, our business and prospects could be harmed.
we operate in a highly regulated industry, and changes in healthcare-related laws and regulations or our inability to obtain in a timely manner or at all u.s. or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our newly developed products or product enhancements could adversely affect our business and prospects.
we operate in a highly regulated industry. as a result, governmental actions may adversely affect our business, operations or financial condition, including:
•   new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to healthcare availability, method of delivery and payment for healthcare products and services;
•   changes in the fda and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity;
•   changes in fda and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products, or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products; and
•   new laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing practices.
given the high level of regulatory oversight to which our products are subject, the process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time-consuming. in addition, there is a risk that any approvals or clearances, once obtained, may be withdrawn. most medical devices cannot be marketed in the u.s. without 510(k) clearance or premarket approval by the fda. any modifications to a device that has received a pre-market approval that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device require a pre-market approval supplement or possibly a separate pre-market approval, either of which is likely to be time-consuming, expensive and uncertain to obtain. if the fda requires us to seek one or more pre-market approval supplements or new pre-market approvals for any modification to a previously approved device, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified device until we obtain approval, and we may be subject to significant criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, but not limited to, regulatory fines or penalties. last year, we received a letter from the fda regarding the monalisa touch® laser and whether our existing 510(k) clearances adequately include certain claims made on our website. in connection with this inquiry, we elected to suspend marketing and distribution of our tempsure vitalia handpieces and single-use probes until we assessed the implications of recent fda considerations for devices in this category. this suspension had a negative impact on our revenue. states may also regulate the manufacture, sale and use of medical devices, particularly those that employ x-ray technology.
our products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies. for example, the eu has adopted the eu medical device regulation (the "eu mdr") and the in vitro diagnostic regulation (the "eu ivdr"), each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. manufacturers of currently approved medical devices will have until may 2020 to meet the requirements of the eu mdr and until may 2022 to meet the eu ivdr. complying with the requirements of these regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures. failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements.
the regulatory environment in china is evolving, and officials in the chinese government exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply regulations. it is possible that the chinese government's current or future interpretation and application of existing or new regulations will negatively impact our china operations, result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties.
we anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize the healthcare industry closely and that changes in laws, regulations or policies by governmental authorities may cause increased uncertainties and compliance costs, exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our business and operations. delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals for future products could delay or preclude realization of product revenues from new products or result in substantial additional costs which could decrease our profitability.
increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data.
increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats, computer viruses and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks, as well as cybersecurity failures resulting from human error and technological errors, pose a risk to the security of hologic and its customers, business partners and suppliers products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data on these products, systems and networks. as the perpetrators of such attacks become more capable, and as critical infrastructure is increasingly becoming digitized, the risks in this area continue to grow. while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, monitoring and testing, and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats, and there is no assurance that the impact from such threats will not be material. in addition to existing risks, the adoption of new technologies may also increase our exposure to cybersecurity breaches and failures. we also may have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations or customer-imposed controls. despite our implementation of controls to protect our systems and sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, employee errors and/or malfeasance (including misappropriation by departing employees) that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. data privacy and protection laws are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges, which increase our costs, affect our competitiveness and can expose us to substantial fines or other penalties. in addition, a cyber-related attack could result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, litigation or regulatory action. although we have experienced occasional actual or attempted breaches of our computer systems, to date we do not believe any of these breaches has had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation.
the failure of third-party payors to provide appropriate levels of coverage and reimbursement for the use of our diagnostics, breast and skeletal health and surgical products and treatments facilitated by our products could harm our business and prospects.
sales and market acceptance of our diagnostics, breast and skeletal health and surgical products and the treatments facilitated by these products is dependent upon the coverage decisions and reimbursement policies established by government healthcare programs and private health insurers. these policies affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. reimbursement varies by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and technologies. even if we develop a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless appropriate reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors. further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the u.s. and other countries in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our diagnostics, breast and skeletal health and surgical products or denies coverage for those procedures facilitated by our products, including price regulation, competitive bidding and tendering, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
healthcare cost containment legislation, including the associated rules and regulations, and the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of any such legislation, could harm our business and prospects.
the ongoing implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act, in the u.s., as well as state-level healthcare reform proposals could reduce medical procedure volumes and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products. these reforms include a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. the impact of this healthcare reform legislation, and practices including price regulation, competitive pricing, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments, and managed care arrangements could harm our business and prospects, results of operations and/or financial condition. healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures in the u.s. and in many foreign countries could limit the use of our products, reduce reimbursement available for such use, further tax the sale or use of our products, adversely affect the use of new therapies for which our products may be targeted, and further increase the administrative and financial burden of compliance.
these reforms and cost containment measures, including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect, could also have an adverse effect on our customers' purchasing decisions regarding our products and could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. we cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally. however, any changes that lower reimbursements for our products and/or procedures using our products, reduce medical procedure volumes, increase cost containment pressures or impose taxes or additional costs on us or others in the healthcare sector could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
guidelines, recommendations and studies published by various organizations may reduce the use of our products.
professional societies, government agencies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations, and organizations involved in healthcare issues may publish guidelines, recommendations or studies to the healthcare and patient communities. organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products and those of our competitors. if followed by healthcare providers and insurers, such publications could result in decreased use of our products. for example, in november 2012, the american congress of obstetrics and gynecologists, known as the acog, released updates in which they have recommended less frequent cervical cancer screening similar to guidelines released in march 2012 by the u.s. preventative services task force, or the uspstf, and the american cancer society. we believe that these recommendations and guidelines may have contributed to increased screening intervals for cervical cancer, which we believe has and may continue to adversely affect our thinprep revenues. in addition, on october 20, 2015, the american cancer society issued new guidelines recommending that women start annual mammograms at age 45 instead of 40 and have a mammogram every two years instead of annually. this recommendation could result in a decrease in purchases of our mammography systems.
if the u.s. medical device excise tax on medical devices is reinstated our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.
the united states imposed a 2.3% excise tax on u.s. sales of class i, ii and iii medical devices beginning in january 2013. as such, this excise tax applied to the majority, if not all, of our products sold in the u.s. the implementation of the medical device tax was suspended for calendar years 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. the tax for sales after december 31, 2019 will be reinstated unless there is legislative effort to temporarily suspend or permanently repeal the tax. while the excise tax was in effect, it increased our costs of doing business, and its reinstatement would increase our operating expenses, impose significant additional administrative burdens and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to increased demands for price concessions or the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our significant market segments, which could harm our business and prospects.
the cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry, which we expect will continue, including with respect to hospitals and clinical laboratories. this consolidation has resulted in greater pricing pressures, decreased average selling prices, and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our customers. we are dependent upon a relatively small number of large clinical laboratory customers in the u.s. for a significant portion of our sales of diagnostics products. due in part to a trend toward consolidation of clinical laboratories in recent years and the relative size of the largest u.s. laboratories, it is likely that a significant portion of these sales will continue to be concentrated among a relatively small number of large clinical laboratories.
interruptions, delays, shutdowns or damage at our manufacturing facilities could harm our business.
in most cases, the manufacturing of each of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations. an interruption in manufacturing capabilities at any of these facilities, as a result of equipment failure or other reasons, could reduce, delay or prevent the production of our products. our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers or suppliers are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events, such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods or weather conditions. manufacturing facilities may experience plant shutdowns, strikes or other labor disruptions, or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment failures, loss of power, gray outs, delays in deliveries or extensive damage, which could harm our business and prospects. some of our manufacturing operations are located outside the u.s., including in costa rica and the uk. those manufacturing operations are also subject to additional challenges and risks associated with international operations described herein.
some of our activities may subject us to risks under federal and state laws prohibiting "kickbacks" and false or fraudulent claims.
we are subject to the provisions of a federal law commonly known as the anti-kickback statute, and several similar state laws, which prohibit payments intended to induce physicians or others either to refer patients or to acquire or arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services. while the federal law applies only to products or services for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program, state laws often apply regardless of whether federal funds may be involved. these laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs that may be used with hospitals, physicians, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices. other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from medicare, medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. similarly, the patient protection and affordable care act also includes stringent reporting requirements of financial relationships between device manufacturers and physicians and teaching hospitals. specifically, under one provision of the law, which is commonly referred to as the physician payment sunshine act, we are required to collect data on and annually report to cms certain payments or other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and annually report certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians or their immediate family members. anti-kickback and false claims laws and the physician payment sunshine act prescribe civil and criminal penalties (including fines) for noncompliance that can be substantial.
similarly, our international operations are subject to the provisions of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended ("fcpa"), which prohibits u.s. companies and their representatives from offering or making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. in many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign official for purposes of the fcpa. our international operations are also subject to various other international anti-bribery laws such as the uk anti-bribery act. despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct, which include training and compliance programs and internal policies and procedures, we may not always prevent unauthorized, reckless or criminal acts by our employees or agents, or employees or agents of businesses or operations we may acquire. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we also could be subject to adverse publicity, severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes and other remedial actions. moreover, our failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, and withdrawal of an approved product from the market.
our international operations and foreign acquisitions expose us to additional operational challenges that we might not otherwise face.
international expansion is a key component of our growth strategy. in fiscal 2019, 24.7% of our revenue came from outside of the u.s. as we grow internationally, our future and existing international operations may subject us to a number of additional risks and expenses, any of which could harm our operating results. these risks and expenses include:
•   political and economic changes and disruptions, export/import controls and tariff regulations;
•   difficulties in developing staffing and simultaneously managing operations in multiple locations as a result of, among other things, distance, language and cultural differences;
•   governmental currency controls;
•   multiple, conflicting and changing government laws and regulations (including, among other things, antitrust and tax requirements);
•   protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies;
•   difficulties in the collection of trade accounts receivable;
•   difficulties and expenses related to implementing internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures;
•   expenses associated with customizing products for clients in foreign countries;
•   possible adverse tax consequences;
•   the inability to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals or favorable third-party reimbursement;
•   operation in parts of the world where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices;
•   the inability to effectively obtain, maintain, protect or enforce intellectual property rights, reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries, and the inability to otherwise protect against clone or "knock off" products;
•   the lack of ability to enforce non-compete agreements with former owners of acquired businesses competing with us in china and other foreign countries; and
•   lower margins on a number of our products sold outside of the u.s.
our diagnostics segment depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its product sales, the loss of any of these customers or any cancellation or delay of a large purchase by any of these customers could significantly reduce revenues in our diagnostics segment.
although we do not currently have any customers that represent more than 10% of our consolidated revenues, a material portion of product sales in our diagnostics segment comes from (and we anticipate will continue to come from) a limited number of customers, one of whom accounted for 14.5% of our diagnostics segment revenue in fiscal 2019. the loss of any of these key customers, or a significant reduction in sales volume or pricing to these customers, could significantly reduce our diagnostics segment revenues or profitability.
if we cannot maintain our current corporate collaborations and enter into new corporate collaborations, our product development could be delayed and our revenue could be adversely impacted.
we have relied and/or expect to rely on corporate collaborators for funding development, marketing, distribution, and the commercialization of certain products. if any of our corporate collaborators were to breach, terminate, fail to renew our agreements or otherwise fail to properly conduct its obligations in a timely manner, the development or commercialization and subsequent marketing of the products contemplated by the collaboration could be delayed or terminated. further, we would be required to devote additional resources to product development or marketing, to terminate some development programs or to seek alternative corporate collaborations. any corporate collaboration may divert management time and resources. in some instances, we have entered into corporate collaborations with certain partners or companies that could make it more difficult for us to enter into advantageous business transactions or relationships with others. any of the foregoing risks could harm our business and prospects.
the markets for our newly developed products and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products may not develop as expected.
the successful commercialization of our newly developed products and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products are subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:
•   uncertainty of the development of a market for such product;
•   trends relating to, or the introduction or existence of, competing products or technologies that may be more effective, safer or easier to use than our products or technologies;
•   the perception of our products as compared to other products;
•   recommendation and support for the use of our products by influential customers, such as highly regarded hospitals, physicians and treatment centers;
•   the availability and extent of data demonstrating the clinical efficacy of our products or treatments;
•   competition, including the presence of competing products sold by companies with longer operating histories, more recognizable names and more established distribution networks; and
•   other technological developments.
often, the development of a significant market for a product will depend upon the establishment of a reimbursement code or an advantageous reimbursement level for use of the product. moreover, even if addressed, such reimbursement codes or levels frequently are not established until after a product is developed and commercially introduced, which can delay the successful commercialization of a product.
if we are unable to successfully commercialize and create a significant market for our newly developed products and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products our business and prospects could be harmed.
our business is dependent on technologies we license, and if we fail to maintain these licenses or license new technologies and rights to particular nucleic acid sequences for targeted diseases in the future, we may be limited in our ability to develop new products.
our business is dependent on licenses from third parties for some of our key technologies. for example, our patented tma technology is based on technology we licensed from stanford university. we anticipate that we will enter into new licensing arrangements in the ordinary course of business to expand our product portfolio and access new technologies to enhance our products and develop new products. many of these licenses will provide us with exclusive rights to the subject technology or disease marker. if our license with respect to any of these technologies or markers is terminated for any reason, we may not be able to sell products that incorporate the technology. similarly, we may lose competitive advantages if we fail to maintain exclusivity under an exclusive license.
our ability to develop additional diagnostic tests for diseases may depend on the ability of third parties to discover particular sequences or markers and correlate them with disease, as well as the rate at which such discoveries are made. our ability to design products that target these diseases may depend on our ability to obtain the necessary rights from the third parties that make any of these discoveries. in addition, there are a finite number of diseases and conditions for which our nat diagnostic assays may be economically viable. if we are unable to access new technologies or the rights to particular sequences or markers necessary for additional diagnostic products on commercially reasonable terms, we may be limited in our ability to develop new diagnostic products.
our products and manufacturing processes may require access to technologies and materials that may be subject to patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain the additional intellectual property rights necessary to commercialize our products.
our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology.
we have relied primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and confidentiality procedures to protect our products and technology. despite these precautions, unauthorized third parties may infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property, or copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology. the pursuit and assertion of a patent right, particularly in areas like nucleic acid diagnostics and biotechnology, involve complex determinations and, therefore, are characterized by substantial uncertainty. we do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued with the full scope of the claims sought, if at all, or whether any patents that do issue will be challenged or invalidated. the patents that we own or license could also be subjected to invalidation proceedings or similar disputes, and an unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to the technology from the prevailing party. in addition, the laws governing patentability and the scope of patent coverage continue to evolve, particularly in the field of biotechnology. as a result, patents might not issue from certain of our patent applications or from applications licensed to us.
we have obtained or applied for corresponding patents and patent applications in several foreign countries for some of our u.s. patents and patent applications. there is a risk that these patent applications will not be granted or that the patent or patent application will not provide significant protection for our products and technology. moreover, there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as intellectual property laws in the u.s.
the rights provided by a patent are finite in time. over the coming years, certain patents relating to current products will expire in the u.s. and abroad thus allowing third parties to utilize certain of our technologies.
our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology that our patents do not cover. in addition, because patent applications in the u.s. are not generally publicly disclosed until eighteen months after the application is filed, applications may have been filed by third parties that relate to our technology. even if our proprietary information is protected by patents or otherwise, the initiation of actions to protect our proprietary information could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel, and the outcome of such litigation is often uncertain. as a result of these uncertainties, we could also elect to forego such litigation or settle such litigation without fully enforcing our proprietary rights. in the absence of significant patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products, processes or technology.
within our medical aesthetics business, we jointly own certain patents and patent applications with third parties. in the absence of an agreement with each co-owner of jointly owned patent rights, we will be subject to default rules pertaining to joint ownership. some countries require the consent of all joint owners to exploit, license or assign jointly owned patents, and if we are unable to obtain that consent from the joint owners, we may be unable to exploit the invention or to license or assign our rights under these patents and patent applications in those countries.
our business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device, diagnostic products and related industries. we are and have been involved in patent litigation and may in the future be subject to further claims of infringement of intellectual property rights possessed by third parties. in connection with claims of patent infringement, we may seek to enter into settlement and/or licensing arrangements. there is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms. alternatively, we may decide to litigate such claims or to design around the patented technology. these actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. as a result, any infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers resulting from infringement claims, whether or not proven to be true, may harm our business and prospects.
we utilize distributors for a portion of our sales, the loss of which could harm our revenues in the territory serviced by these distributors.
we rely on strategic relationships with a number of key distributors for sales and service of our products. if any of our strategic relationships terminate without replacement or if our strategic partners fail to perform their contractual obligations, our revenues and/or ability to service our products in the territories serviced by these distributors could be adversely affected. we do not control our distributors, and these parties may not be successful in marketing our products. these parties may fail to commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations.
if we elect to distribute new products directly, we will have to invest in additional sales and marketing resources, including additional field sales personnel, which would significantly increase future selling, general and administrative expenses. if we fail to successfully market our products, our product sales will decrease. we may also be exposed to risks as a result of transitioning a territory from a distributor sales model to a direct sales model, such as difficulties maintaining relationships with specific customers, hiring appropriately trained personnel or ensuring compliance with local product registration requirements, any of which could result in lower revenues than previously received from the distributor in that territory.
our results of operations are subject to significant quarterly variation.
our results of operations have been and may continue to be subject to significant quarterly variation. our results for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors, including:
•   the overall state of healthcare and cost containment efforts;
•   the timing and level of reimbursement for our products domestically and internationally;
•   the development status and demand for our products;
•   the development status and demand for therapies to treat the health concerns addressed by our products;
•   economic conditions in our markets;
•   foreign exchange rates;
•   the timing of orders;
•   the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales;
•   the mix of products we sell and markets we serve;
•   regulatory approval and compliance of products;
•   the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors;
•   pricing and other competitive conditions;
•   unanticipated expenses;
•   complex revenue recognition rules pursuant to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, which we refer to as u.s. gaap;
•   asset impairments;
•   contingent consideration charges;
•   restructuring and consolidation charges;
•   debt refinancing charges and expenses; and
•   seasonality of sales of certain of our products.
customers may also cancel or reschedule shipments. production difficulties could also delay shipments. any of these factors also could harm our business and prospects.
failure to comply with laws relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards related to the transmission of electronic health data, may require us to make significant changes to our products, or incur penalties or other liabilities.
state, federal and foreign laws, such as the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, or hipaa, regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information and the circumstances under which such information may be released. these measures may govern the disclosure and use of personal and patient medical record information and may require users of such information to implement specified security measures, and to notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches. evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner, either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. other health information standards, such as regulations under hipaa, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specified electronic transactions, for example transactions involving submission of claims to third-party payors. these standards also continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply.
outside the u.s., we are impacted by privacy and data security requirements at the international, national and regional level, and on an industry specific basis. more privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted, and more are being enforced, with potential for significant financial penalties. in the eu, increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules have been enacted. the eu general data protection regulation (gdpr) applies uniformly across the eu and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances. the gdpr also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the eu to comply with eu privacy and data protection rules.
failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements, or to abide by electronic health data transmission standards, could expose us to breach of contract claims, fines and penalties, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.
we are subject to the risk of product liability claims relating to our products for which we may not have adequate insurance.
our business involves the risk of product liability and other claims inherent to the medical device business. if even one of our products is found to have caused or contributed to injuries or deaths, we could be held liable for substantial damages. we maintain product liability insurance subject to deductibles and exclusions. there is a risk that the insurance coverage will not be sufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims, or that product liability insurance will not be available to us at a reasonable cost, if at all. an under-insured or uninsured claim could harm our business and prospects. in addition, claims could adversely affect the reputation of the related product, which could damage that product's competitive position in the market.
the sale and use of our diagnostic products could also lead to the filing of product liability claims if someone were to allege that one of our products contained a design or manufacturing defect that resulted in inaccurate test results or the failure to detect a disorder for which it was being used to screen, or caused injuries to a patient. any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in an increase in our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure additional coverage in the future. also, even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could be time consuming and expensive to defend, which could result in a diversion of management's attention from our business and could adversely affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products and could harm our business and prospects.
because we do not require training for users of our non-invasive medical aesthetics products, and we sell these products to non-physicians, there exists an increased potential for misuse of these products, which could harm our reputation and our business.
federal regulations allow us to sell our medical aesthetics products to or on the order of practitioners licensed by law to use or order the use of a prescription device. the definition of "licensed practitioners" varies from state to state. as a result, our products may be purchased or operated by physicians with varying levels of training and, in many states, by non-physicians, including nurse practitioners, chiropractors and technicians. outside the u.s., many jurisdictions do not require specific qualifications or training for purchasers or operators of our products. we do not supervise the procedures performed with our products, nor can we require that direct medical supervision occur. we and our distributors offer product training sessions, but neither we nor our distributors require purchasers or operators of our non-invasive products to attend training sessions. the lack of required training and the purchase and use of our non-invasive products by non-physicians may result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes, which could harm our reputation and expose us to costly product liability litigation.
we are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including related to our use and recycling of hazardous materials and the composition of our products.
our research and development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, such as toxic and carcinogenic chemicals and various radioactive compounds, and the risk of contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. in such event, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any such liability could be extensive. from time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. these regulations include, for example, regulations enacted in the eu such as the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemical substances, or reach, which requires the registration of and regulates use of certain chemicals, the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive, or rohs, which regulates the use of certain hazardous substances in certain products we manufacture, and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive, or weee, which requires the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from certain products we manufacture. these and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in japan, china and various states of the u.s. may require us to re-design our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, for example by requiring the use of different types of materials. these redesigns or the use of alternative materials may detrimentally impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions, result in additional costs or have other similar effects. we are also subject to other substantial regulation relating to environmental, health and safety matters, including occupational health and safety, environmental protection, hazardous substance control, and waste management and disposal. the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to, among other things, fines and criminal liability. we may also be required to incur significant costs to comply with these and future regulations, which may result in a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operation.
an adverse change in the projected cash flows from our business units or the business climate in which they operate could require us to record an impairment charge, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.
at least annually, we review the carrying value of our goodwill, and for other long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present, to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment of the value of these assets. conditions that could indicate impairment and necessitate an evaluation of these assets include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate or the legal or regulatory environment within which we operate. in addition, the deterioration of a company's market capitalization significantly below its net book value is an indicator of impairment. we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and in evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates.
during fiscal 2019, we identified indicators of impairment for our medical aesthetics reporting unit as a result of reductions in forecasts during the year, and in connection with our efforts to sell the business that began prior to the end of fiscal 2019. we executed a definitive agreement on november 20, 2019 to sell the business. the definitive agreement contains representations and warranties and covenants customary for a transaction of this nature, and the completion of the sale is subject to customary closing conditions. however, we cannot assure that we will be able to complete this transaction on a timely basis, if at all. although this agreement was signed subsequent to the balance sheet date, we concluded that it provided evidence regarding the estimate of fair value of the asset group at september 28, 2019 and that there were no events that occurred between september 28, 2019 and the date we entered into the definitive agreement that would significantly affect the fair value of the asset group. as a result of these indicators of impairment, we recorded total impairment charges of $685.4 million in fiscal 2019.
although we believe that we use reasonable methodologies for developing assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. any significant adverse change regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows, terminal value growth rates and discount rates used in valuing our reporting units could require us to record an impairment charge, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. it is possible that the continuation of the current global financial and economic uncertainty could negatively affect our anticipated future cash flows, or the discount rates used to value the cash flows for each of our reporting units to such an extent that we could be required to perform an interim impairment test during fiscal 2020.
we cannot assure we will be able to close our pending sale of cynosure on a timely basis, if at all.
our pending sale of cynosure is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, including the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the purchase and sale agreement, the failure of the parties to the transaction to satisfy conditions to completion of the proposed transaction, the risk that regulatory or other approvals are delayed or subject to terms and conditions that are not anticipated. as a result, we cannot assure that the pending transaction will be completed on a timely basis, if at all. the purchase price is subject to adjustment and may be different than we anticipate, and we may incur unexpected liabilities in connection with the transaction.
changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the company's operating results.
we are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income based taxes, in both the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions. we are also subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions, and tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. our future effective tax rate could be unfavorably affected by numerous factors including a change in, or the interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, a change in our geographic earnings mix, or a change in the measurement of our deferred taxes.
risks relating to our indebtedness we have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding, which limits our operating flexibility, and could adversely affect our operations and financial results and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.
as of september 28, 2019, we had approximately $3.1 billion aggregate principal of indebtedness outstanding. we also have other contractual obligations. this significant level of indebtedness and our other obligations may:
•   make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness;
•   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates;
•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, strategic transactions and other general corporate purposes;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we participate;
•   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and
•   limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, strategic transactions or other general corporate purposes.
in addition, the terms of our financing obligations contain certain covenants that restrict our ability, and that of our subsidiaries, to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions, including, among other things, limitations on our ability to:
•   incur indebtedness or issue certain preferred equity;
•   pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, or make other distributions or restricted payments;
•   make certain investments;
•   agree to payment restrictions affecting the restricted subsidiaries;
•   sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of assets, including equity interests of our subsidiaries;
•   enter into transactions with our affiliates;
•   create liens;
•   designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries;
•   consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets; and
•   use the proceeds of permitted sales of our assets.
our amended and restated credit facilities also require us to satisfy certain financial covenants. our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by general economic conditions, political decisions, industry conditions and other events beyond our control. our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our amended and restated credit facilities, including financial covenants, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
if there were an event of default under one of our debt instruments or a change of control, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately and may be cross-defaulted to other debt, including our outstanding notes. our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default or a change of control, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on such debt. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources."
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness and other obligations.
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures, strategic transactions and expansion efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. this, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.
our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and we can give no assurance that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness as such indebtedness matures and to fund our other liquidity needs. if this occurs, we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. we may need to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity or debt financing. these alternative strategies may not be affected on satisfactory terms, if at all. our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, will depend on, among other things, our financial condition at the time, restrictions in agreements governing our indebtedness, and other factors, including the condition of the financial markets and the markets in which we compete.
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and additional borrowings, refinancings or proceeds from asset sales are not available to us, we may not have sufficient cash to enable us to meet all of our obligations.
a significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which may expose us to higher interest payments.
a significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which makes us more vulnerable in the event of adverse economic conditions, increases in prevailing interest rates, or a downturn in our business. as of september 28, 2019, approximately $1.7 billion aggregate principal of our indebtedness, which represented the outstanding principal under our term loan under our 2018 credit agreement and amounts outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization program, was subject to floating interest rates. we currently have certain hedging arrangements in the form of interest rate cap and interest rate swap agreements in place to mitigate the impact of higher interest rates. the interest rate cap agreements hedge $1.0 billion of principal under our amended and restated credit agreement and have a december 2019 termination date and december 2020 termination date for the interest rate cap agreements entered into in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, respectively. in fiscal 2019, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge $1.0 billion of principal under our amended and restated credit agreement with an effective date of december 2020 and termination date of december 2023.
the proposed discontinuation or replacement of libor would require us to amend certain agreements and may otherwise adversely affect our business.
the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021. changes in the method of calculating libor, or the replacement of libor with an alternative rate or benchmark, may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. this could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. if changes are made to the method of calculating libor or libor ceases to exist, we may need to amend certain contracts, including our credit agreement and related interest rate swap agreements, and we cannot predict what alternative rate or benchmark would be negotiated. this may result in an increase to our interest expense.
risks relating to our common stock provisions in our charter, bylaws, and indebtedness may have the effect of discouraging advantageous offers for our business or common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
our charter, bylaws, and the provisions of the delaware general corporation law include provisions that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change of control. our indebtedness also contains provisions which either accelerate or require us to offer to repurchase the indebtedness at a premium upon a change of control. these provisions could limit the price that our stockholders might receive in the future for shares of our common stock.
our stock price is volatile.
the market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:
•   new, or changes in, recommendations, guidelines or studies that could affect the use of our products;
•   announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, including changes in reimbursement rates or regulatory requirements, proposed and completed acquisitions, or the industry in which we compete;
•   published studies and reports relating to the comparative efficacy of products and markets in which we participate;
•   quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels;
•   general conditions in the u.s. or worldwide economy;
•   our stock repurchase program;
•   announcements of technological innovations;
•   new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;
•   developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation;
•   developments in relationships with our customers and suppliers;
•   the implementation of healthcare reform legislation and the adoption of additional reform legislation in the future; and
•   the success or lack of success of integrating our acquisitions.
in addition, the stock market in general and the markets for shares of "high-tech" and life sciences companies, have historically experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the market price of our common stock may decline.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, the information described under the caption "risk factors" in part i, item 1a of this report and our special note regarding forward-looking statements at the outset of this report.
overview we are a developer, manufacturer and supplier of premium diagnostics products, medical imaging systems, surgical products and light-based aesthetic and medical treatment systems with an emphasis on women's health. we operate in five segments: diagnostics, breast health, medical aesthetics, gyn surgical and skeletal health. we sell and service our products through a combination of direct sales and service personnel and a network of independent distributors and sales representatives.
we offer a wide range of diagnostic products which are used primarily to aid in the diagnosis of human diseases, and through january 31, 2017, we offered products that screened donated human blood and plasma. our primary diagnostics products include our aptima family of molecular diagnostic assays, which run on our advanced instrumentation systems (panther and tigris), our thinprep cytology system, and the rapid fetal fibronectin test. the aptima family of molecular diagnostic assays is used to detect, among other things, the infectious microorganisms that cause common sexually transmitted diseases, or stds, chlamydia and gonorrhea, certain high-risk strains of human papillomavirus, or hpv, and trichomonas vaginalis, the parasite that causes trichomoniasis. in addition, in 2017 and 2018 we introduced aptima quantitative viral load tests for hiv, hepatitis c and hepatitis b. the aptima portfolio also includes diagnostic tests for a range of acute respiratory ailments that are run on the panther fusion system, a field upgradeable instrument addition to panther. the thinprep system is primarily used in cytology applications, such as cervical cancer screening, and the rapid fetal fibronectin test assists physicians in assessing the risk of pre-term birth.
our breast health products include a broad portfolio of solutions for breast cancer care for radiology, pathology and surgery. these solutions include breast imaging and analytics, such as our 2d and 3d mammography systems and reading workstations, minimally invasive breast biopsy guidance systems and devices, breast surgery and biopsy site markers and localization, specimen radiology, ultrasound and connectivity solutions. our most advanced breast imaging platforms, selenia dimensions and 3dimensions, utilizes a technology called tomosynthesis to produce 3d images that show multiple contiguous slice images of the breast, which we refer to as the genius 3d mammography exam, as well as conventional 2d full field digital mammography images. our clinical results for fda approval demonstrated that conventional 2d digital mammography with the addition of 3d tomosynthesis is superior to 2d digital mammography alone for both screening and diagnostics for women of all ages and breast densities. in addition, through our recent acquisitions of faxitron and focal we have expanded our product portfolio to include breast conserving surgery products.
our medical aesthetics segment offers a portfolio of aesthetic treatment systems, including sculpsure, picosure and monalisa touch that enable plastic surgeons, dermatologists and other medical practitioners to perform non-invasive and minimally invasive procedures to remove hair, treat vascular and benign pigmented lesions, remove multi-colored tattoos, revitalize the skin, reduce fat through laser lipolysis, reduce cellulite, clear nails infected by toe fungus, ablate sweat glands and improve gynecologic health. this segment also markets tempsure, a radio frequency (or "rf") energy sourced platform that offers both non-surgical and surgical aesthetic treatments and procedures. on november 20, 2019, we executed a definitive agreement to sell our medical aesthetics business for a sales price of $205 million in cash subject to certain closing adjustments. net of these adjustments, we expect net proceeds of approximately $138 million. we expect this disposition to be completed around the end of calendar year 2019. the definitive agreement contains representations and warranties and covenants customary for a transaction of this nature, and the completion of the sale is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, and certain other competition and regulatory approvals. the definitive agreement also contains certain termination rights for us and the purchaser, including, among other events, (i) if the transaction has not been completed on or prior to march 18, 2020, (ii) following a breach by the other party that would cause a closing condition not to be satisfied and is not or cannot be cured within 60 days' notice of that breach or (ii) if there is any law, injunction or other judgment permanently prohibiting the transaction. we cannot assure that we will be able to complete this transaction on a timely basis.
our gyn surgical products include our novasure endometrial ablation system, or novasure, and our myosure hysteroscopic tissue removal system, or myosure, as well as our fluent fluid management system, or fluent. the novasure portfolio is comprised of the novasure classic and novasure advanced devices and involves a trans-cervical procedure for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. the myosure suite of devices offers four options to provide incision-less removal of fibroids, polyps, and other pathology within the uterus. the fluent system is a fluid management system that provides liquid distention during diagnostic and operative hysteroscopic procedures.
our skeletal health segment's products includes the horizon dxa, a dual energy x-ray system, which evaluates bone density and performs body composition assessments, and the fluoroscan insight fd mini c-arm, which assists in performing minimally invasive orthopedic surgical procedures on a patient's extremities, such as the hand, wrist, knee, foot, and ankle.

acquisitions and dispositions cynosure, inc.
on march 22, 2017, we completed the acquisition of cynosure pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding shares of cynosure. the acquisition was funded through available cash, and the total purchase price was $1.66 billion.
the allocation of the purchase price was based on estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of march 22, 2017. as part of the purchase price allocation, we determined the identifiable intangible assets were developed technology of $736.0 million, in-process research and development of $107.0 million, trade names of $74.0 million, a distribution agreement of $42.0 million and customer relationships of $35.0 million. the fair values of the intangible assets were estimated using the income approach, specifically the excess earning method and relief from royalty method, and the cash flow projections were discounted using rates ranging from 11% to 12%. the cash flows were based on estimates used to price the transaction, and the discount rates applied were benchmarked with reference to the implied rate of return from the transaction model and the weighted average cost of capital.
the developed technology assets comprised know-how, patents and technologies embedded in cynosure's products and relate to currently marketed products. in-process research and development projects related to in-process projects that have not reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date and have no alternative future use. the primary basis for determining technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying product or expected commercial release depending on the project. we recorded $107.0 million of in-process research and development assets related to three projects, which were expected to be completed during fiscal 2018 and 2019 with a preliminary cost to complete of approximately $18.0 million. all of the in-process research and development assets were valued using the multiple-period excess earnings method approach using discount rates ranging from 14% to 22%.
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we obtained regulatory approval for two projects with an aggregate fair value of $61.0 million and these assets were reclassified to developed technology. the remaining project, which had an initial fair value of $46.0 million, was abandoned in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 due to unsuccessful clinical results. as a result, the company recorded a $46.0 million impairment charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
the calculation of the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired was recorded to goodwill. the factors contributing to the recognition of the amount of goodwill were based on several strategic and synergistic benefits that were expected to be realized from the cynosure acquisition. these benefits included the expectation that our entry into the aesthetics market would significantly broaden our offering in women's health. the combined company was expected to benefit from a broader global presence, synergistic utilization of hologic's direct sales force, primarily its gyn surgical sales force, with certain cynosure products and entry into an adjacent, cash-pay segment. during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we identified indicators of impairment and performed an interim goodwill impairment test. this analysis resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $685.7 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
during fiscal 2019, we identified indicators of impairment for our medical aesthetics reporting unit as a result of reductions in forecasts during the year, and in connection with our efforts to sell the business that began prior to the end of fiscal 2019. we executed a definitive agreement on november 20, 2019 to sell the business. although this agreement was signed subsequent to the balance sheet date, we concluded that it provided evidence regarding the estimate of fair value of the asset group at september 28, 2019 and that there were no events that occurred between september 28, 2019 and the date we entered into the definitive agreement that would significantly affect the fair value of the asset group. as a result of these indicators of impairment we recorded total impairment charges of $685.4 million in fiscal 2019 to record the asset group to its fair value.

medicor medical supply on april 7, 2017, we completed the acquisition of mms medicor medical supplies gmbh, or medicor, for a purchase price of $19.0 million. medicor was a long-standing distributor of our breast and skeletal health products in germany, austria and switzerland.
emsor, s.a.
on december 11, 2017, we completed the acquisition of emsor s.a., or emsor, for a purchase price of $16.3 million, which included contingent consideration estimated at $4.9 million as of the measurement date. the contingent consideration is payable upon emsor achieving predefined amounts of cumulative revenue over a two year period from the date of acquisition. emsor was a distributor of our breast and skeletal health products in spain and portugal.
faxitron on july 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of faxitron bioptics, llc, or faxitron, for a purchase price of $89.5 million, which included hold-backs of $11.7 million that were payable up to one year from the date of acquisition, and contingent consideration which we estimated at $2.9 million as of the measurement date. the contingent consideration is payable upon meeting certain revenue growth metrics. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we increased the contingent consideration liability by $1.7 million based on updated projections. in fiscal 2019, we paid $6.5 million of the hold-back and have withheld the remaining $5.2 million under the indemnification provisions of the purchase agreement, which the former shareholders are disputing. faxitron, headquartered in tucson, arizona, develops, manufactures, and markets digital radiography systems. faxitron's results of operations are reported in our breast health reportable segment from the date of acquisition. based on our valuation, we allocated $53.2 million of the purchase price to the value of intangible assets and $45.6 million to goodwill.
focal therapeutics on october 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of focal therapeutics, inc., or focal, for a purchase price of $120.1 million, which included hold-backs of $14.0 million payable up to one year from the date of acquisition. in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, $1.5 million of the hold-back was paid, and the remaining $12.5 million was paid on october 1, 2019. focal, headquartered in california, manufactures and markets its biozorb marker, which is an implantable three-dimensional marker that helps clinicians overcome certain challenges in breast conserving surgery. based on our valuation, we allocated $97.2 million of the purchase price to the value of intangible assets and $31.1 million to goodwill.
supersonic imagine on august 1, 2019, we acquired approximately 46% of the outstanding shares of supersonic imagine s. a., or ssi. ssi, headquartered in france, specializes in ultrasound imaging and designs, develops and markets an ultrasound platform used in the non-invasive care path for the characterization of breast, liver or prostate diseases. we have accounted for this investment as an equity method investment and as a result we recorded a loss of $3.3 million within other income, net, representing our proportionate share of ssi's loss for the two months ended september 28, 2019. in september 2019, we launched a tender offer to acquire all of the remaining shares of ssi that we did not already own for a price of €1.50 per share in cash. effective november 21, 2019, we acquired an additional 7.6 million shares for $12.5 million. as a result, we own approximately 78% of the outstanding shares and will launch a second tender offer with similar terms to acquire the remaining shares. we will perform purchase accounting in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and expect to begin consolidating ssi's results effective november 21, 2019.
blood screening business disposition in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our blood screening business to grifols for a sales price of $1.85 billion in cash, subject to adjustment based on the closing amount of inventory. the transaction closed on january 31, 2017 and we received $1.865 billion. the sale resulted in a gain of $899.7 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. as a result of this disposition and proceeds received, we recorded a tax obligation of $649.5 million, which was paid in fiscal 2017. upon the closing of the transaction, our existing collaboration agreement with grifols terminated, and a new collaboration agreement was executed as part of this transaction for us to provide certain research and development services to grifols. in addition, we agreed to provide transition services to grifols over a two to three year period depending on the nature of the respective service, including the manufacture of inventory, and we are in effect serving as a contract manufacturer of assays for grifols for a two to three year period from the disposal date. we also agreed to sell panther instrumentation and certain supplies to grifols as part of a long term supply agreement. following the closing of this disposition, we no longer operate our blood screening business, except to the limited extent we have agreed to support grifols. under the long term supply agreement, transition services agreement to manufacture assays, and research and development services, we recognized revenues of $58.5 million and $55.4 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. for the disposed blood screening business, in fiscal 2017, revenue was $96.5 million, gross profit was $64.8 million and operating income was $45.8 million. revenue, gross profit and operating income of the disposed business represents the financial impact of the business as it was operated prior to the date of disposition. the operating expenses include only those that were directly incurred and retained by the disposed business and are now incurred by grifols. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.

we generated a 4.8% increase in product revenues in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 due to increases across all our business segments except medical aesthetics, which experienced a decline primarily attributable to a reduction in volume of sculpsure and monalisa touch system sales. in the breast health business segment, the acquisitions of faxitron and focal contributed combined product revenues of $49.2 million in fiscal 2019.
diagnostics product revenues increased 5.0% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increases in molecular diagnostics (excluding blood screening) of $64.2 million partially offset by decreases in cytology & perinatal of $8.6 million. in addition, product revenue from blood screening, which we divested in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, increased $0.6 million under our agreement to provide grifols manufacturing support through a transition services period and long term access to panther instrumentation and certain raw material supplies. molecular diagnostics product revenue was $665.4 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $601.2 million in fiscal 2018. the increase was primarily attributable to sales volume of our aptima family of assays, which increased $41.9 million on a worldwide basis primarily due to our increased installed base of panther instruments. this installed base is driving higher volumes of assay testing. in addition, we had an increase in worldwide sales of our virology and fusion products for which we have recently received certain international regulatory approvals as part of our strategy to expand our menu of assays on the panther platform. cytology and perinatal product revenue decreased $8.6 million primarily due to lower perinatal volumes, which we primarily attribute to a shift in ordering patterns, and lower domestic thinprep test volumes, which we primarily attribute to screening interval expansion as well as a slight decline in average selling prices, partially offset by an increase in international volumes on a worldwide basis. the increase in revenue was partially offset by the negative foreign currency exchange impact on foreign sales of the strengthening u.s. dollar against a number of currencies.
breast health product revenues increased 10.3% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the inclusion of faxitron and focal products which contributed $44.7 million of the increase in revenues in fiscal 2019. in addition, we had increased unit volumes of our digital mammography systems, primarily our newest 3dimensions and 3d performance systems, which complement our older 3d systems for which we had lower sales, and an increase in our newer workflow products, consisting of intelligent 2d, clarity hd, and smartcurve upgrades, partially offset by lower sales of our brevera breast biopsy system due to supply constraints, affirm prone table and software features, and 3d software upgrades. the increase in revenue was partially offset by the negative foreign currency exchange impact on foreign sales of the strengthening u.s. dollar against a number of currencies.
medical aesthetics product revenues decreased (9.2)% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to a decrease in body contouring product revenues on a worldwide basis primarily driven by lower volumes of sculpsure lasers, submental upgrades and related pac keys, which we believe was partially due to challenges in our domestic sales force earlier in the year and increased competition in the non-invasive fat reduction category. our medical aesthetics product revenues were also adversely affected by lower women's health product sales primarily from lower sales volume of our monalisa touch device, which we believe is primarily driven by the fda's public letter in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 challenging various medical aesthetics companies' marketing of devices for so called "vaginal rejuvenation" procedures relative to their fda approvals. in november of 2018, we received confirmation from the fda that we had adequately addressed all of the concerns expressed in their letter and we continue to market our women's health products accordingly. these decreases were partially offset by higher skin product revenue in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily driven by icon and tempsure system sales. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 in response to the fda letter referred to above we voluntarily recalled the tempsure vitalia handpieces and reversed revenue for refunds and rebates totaling $6.8 million. in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we relaunched the tempsure product line. the decrease in revenue was also partly due to the negative foreign currency exchange impact on foreign sales of the strengthening u.s. dollar against a number of currencies.
gyn surgical product revenues increased 3.6% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increases in the volume of myosure system sales of $9.7 million and increases in fluent systems sales of $10.8 million. we launched our fluent system in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. in addition, we had an increase in revenues in fiscal 2019 from the launch of our new omni scope product. these increases were partially offset by decreases in novasure systems sales of $14.0 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. we attribute the decrease in novasure sales primarily to increased competition and a stagnant market for endometrial ablation. in addition, we have experienced a slight reduction in average selling prices across many of our myosure and novasure devices, which were partially offset by an increase in sales volume for the higher priced novasure advanced device.
skeletal health product revenues increased 5.1% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher sales volume of our horizon dxa systems.
in fiscal 2019, 74.6% of product revenues were generated in the united states, 12.0% in europe, 8.8% in asia-pacific, and 4.6% in other international markets. in fiscal 2018, 74.2% of product revenues were generated in the united states, 12.0% in europe, 9.0% in asia-pacific, and 4.8% in other international markets. the slight increase in the percentage of u.s. revenues was primarily due to the faxitron and focal acquisitions which generate the majority of their revenue in the u.s.

service and other revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service, installation and repair of our products. the majority of these revenues are generated within our breast health segment, and to a lesser extent, our medical aesthetics business. the breast health business continues to convert a high percentage of our installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon expiration of the warranty period. our medical aesthetics business represented 10.5% and 10.6% of service and other revenues in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. service and other revenues increased 3.8% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher installation, spare parts, and service contract conversion and renewal rates for our breast health business. in addition, in the current year, breast health had higher license revenue.

product gross margin was 33.4% in fiscal 2019 compared to 54.4% in fiscal 2018. excluding the impairment of intangible assets and equipment, product gross margin would have been 54.3%
cost of product revenues. the cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues was 34.2% in the current year compared to 33.5% in the prior year. cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to unfavorable manufacturing variances, product mix, step-up in fair value of inventory acquired in the focal acquisition that resulted in additional costs of $7.1 million, increased tariff costs for products imported into china of $7.5 million and higher international freight costs.
diagnostics' product costs as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower thinprep pap test and perinatal sales, unfavorable manufacturing variances, and lower gross margin from blood screening based on the increase in sales under our long-term supply agreement with grifols. these cost increases were partially offset by improved molecular diagnostics' gross margin from increased volume of aptima assays and viral assays.
breast health's product costs as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to unfavorable manufacturing and purchase price variances, the acquisition of focal in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and the related impact of stepping-up the acquired inventory to fair value in purchase accounting that resulted in additional costs of $7.1 million in fiscal 2019, tariff costs in china, an increase in the sales volume of digital mammography systems internationally, which generally have lower average selling prices than domestic system sales, and lower software sales. the increases in costs as a percentage of revenue were partially offset by higher domestic sales volume of the higher margin 3dimensions system sales and increased sales of the higher margin workflow products, consisting of intelligent 2d, clarity hd, and smartcurve upgrades.
medical aesthetics' product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to fiscal 2018 including a $6.8 million revenue reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 for the voluntary tempsure vitalia recall in response to the fda letter and related inventory charges in fiscal 2018. this was partially offset by lower sales volume, unfavorable product mix as we sold fewer units of our higher margin sculpsure laser and related pac keys and monalisa touch device, unfavorable manufacturing variances, increased inventory reserves and tariff costs in china.
gyn surgical's product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to favorable manufacturing variances from overall increased volumes. product costs were relatively consistent in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. while there is a continued mix shift to the lower margin myosure products from novasure comprising a higher percentage of gyn surgical product sales and increased sales of fluent, this trend was offset by an increase in sales volume in fiscal 2019 for the higher margin novasure advanced device compared to the classic device.
skeletal health's product costs as a percentage of revenue were relatively consistent in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018.
amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets included in cost of product revenues relates to acquired developed technology, which is generally amortized over its estimated useful life of between 5 and 15 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed. amortization expense decreased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower amortization from intangible assets acquired in the cynosure acquisition which were written down in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 (partially offset by shortening the remaining life of certain assets) and lower amortization of intangible assets acquired in the cytyc acquisition which reduce over time. these decreases were partially offset by combined amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the faxitron and focal acquisitions of $12.9 million in the fiscal 2019.
impairment of intangible assets and equipment. during fiscal 2019, we identified indicators of impairment for our medical aesthetics reporting unit as a result of reductions in forecasts during the year, and in connection with our efforts to sell the business that began prior to the end of fiscal 2019 as described above. as a result of these indicators of impairment, we recorded total impairment charges of $685.4 million in fiscal 2019. the impairment charge was allocated to developed technology for $576.9 million and equipment assets for $1.8 million, which is included in cost of revenues. in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, this asset group will meet the assets held-for-sale criteria and will be recorded at fair value less the costs to sell, which could result in additional charges.

service and other revenues gross margin was 41.2% in fiscal 2019 compared to 45.1% in fiscal 2018. the decrease in gross margin is primarily due to an increase in costs in breast health to repair digital mammography systems under service contracts, including an increase in spare parts revenue with unfavorable margins, increased departmental spend and higher freight costs, and increased field service costs in medical aesthetics. in fiscal 2019, the reduced gross margin was partially offset by an increase in breast health license revenue, which has a higher gross margin.

research and development expenses. research and development expenses increased 6.2% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to a $4.5 million charge related to the purchase of intellectual property in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, higher compensation expense in breast health due to increased headcount and the inclusion of expenses from the faxitron and focal acquisitions contributing a $4.8 million increase, and an increase in consulting spend, partially offset by a decrease in project spend and a reduction in diagnostics from lower headcount. at any point in time, we have a number of different research projects and clinical trials being conducted and the timing of these projects and related costs can vary from period to period.
selling and marketing expenses. selling and marketing expenses increased 3.7% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to expenses attributable to the faxitron and focal acquisitions contributing a $19.7 million increase in fiscal 2019, increased sales personnel headcount in surgical, increased marketing initiatives in diagnostic, and higher travel partially offset by lower medical aesthetics expenses primarily due to lower compensation expense as a result of lower headcount, and a reduction in marketing initiatives spend and trade shows.
general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses decreased 9.2% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the inclusion in fiscal 2018 of a $34.8 million legal settlement charge related to the smith & nephew patent infringement lawsuit related regarding our myosure system. excluding the impact of the smith & nephew settlement, general and administrative expenses were consistent in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. fiscal 2019 included higher compensation and benefits due to increased headcount and improved results, higher facility and infrastructure costs, increased acquisition and transactional related expenses including contingent consideration, and an increase in accounting and consulting fees related to the adoption of new accounting standards. additionally, the first quarter of fiscal 2018 included a $4.0 million benefit due to resolution of a non-income tax matter. offsetting these increases in fiscal 2019 was lower depreciation expense as fiscal 2018 included accelerated depreciation of cynosure's sap erp system, and a net decrease in legal fees and charges primarily related to the fuji and minerva lawsuits, partially offset by settling the enzo lawsuit in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships, trade names, distributor relationships and business licenses related to our acquisitions. these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 5 and 30 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows. amortization expense decreased 12.3% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower amortization from the intangible assets acquired in the cynosure acquisition which were written down in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
impairment of intangible assets and equipment. as discussed above, we recorded aggregate impairment charges of $685.4 million during fiscal 2019. the impairment charges were allocated to the long-lived assets and written off to operating expenses in the amounts of $22.4 million to customer relationships, $48.6 million to trade names, $27.7 million to distribution agreements and $8.0 million to equipment.
in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we decided to cancel and abandon an in-process research and development project that was recorded as an intangible asset in the cynosure acquisition purchase accounting. the project was abandoned due to unsuccessful clinical results. as a result, we recorded a $46.0 million impairment charge to write-off the full value of the asset.
impairment of goodwill. during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, in connection with commencing our company-wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process, evaluating the current operating performance of our medical aesthetics reporting unit, and abandoning an in-process research and development project, we reduced the short term and long term revenue and operating income forecasts and determined that indicators of impairment existed in our medical aesthetics reporting unit. the updated forecast reflected significantly reduced volume and market penetration projections resulting in lower short-term and long-term profitability than expected at the time of the cynosure acquisition. as a result of those current events and circumstances, we determined that it was more likely than not that this change would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. in performing the impairment test, we utilized the single step approach under accounting standards update no. 2017-04, intangibles-goodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the test for goodwill impairment (asu 2017-04). the goodwill impairment test requires a comparison of the carrying value of the medical aesthetics reporting unit to its estimated fair value. to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit, we utilized a dcf analysis. the forecasted cash flows were based on our most recent budget and strategic plan and for periods beyond the strategic plan, our estimates were based on assumed growth rates expected as of the measurement date. we believe our assumptions were consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying business. the basis of fair value for medical aesthetics assumed the reporting unit would be purchased or sold in a non-taxable transaction, and the discount rate of 12.0% applied to the after-tax cash flows was consistent with that used in the purchase accounting performed in fiscal 2017. we believe our assumptions used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit were reasonable. for additional information pertaining to impairment of goodwill, please refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report.
restructuring charges. in fiscal 2017, in connection with our acquisition of cynosure, we implemented certain organizational changes, and we also eliminated certain research and development positions in breast health and manufacturing positions primarily in our diagnostics division. in fiscal 2018, we finalized our decision to consolidate legacy international accounting and customer service organizations into our manchester, uk location and decided to eliminate positions in belgium, france, italy, spain and germany. this transition was completed in fiscal 2019. we also eliminated certain sales and marketing personnel in our diagnostics and medical aesthetics divisions. additionally, we decided to close our hicksville, new york facility which manufactured certain cynosure products and the employees were notified of termination and related benefits in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. in fiscal 2019, we decided to transfer certain shared services positions to our costa rica facility from our marlborough location and made other employee termination actions. pursuant to u.s. gaap, the related severance and benefit charges are recognized either ratably over the respective required employee service periods or up-front for contractual benefits. in fiscal 2019 and 2018, we recorded aggregate charges of $6.6 million and $14.2 million, respectively, from these actions, primarily for severance and benefits and to a lesser extent lease obligation charges for facility closure costs. for additional information, please refer to note 6 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report.

interest expense in fiscal 2019 and 2018 consists primarily of the cash interest costs and the related amortization of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs on our outstanding debt. interest expense in fiscal 2019 decreased compared to fiscal 2018 primarily from refinancing our 2022 senior notes with our 2025 and 2028 senior notes that carry lower rates, extinguishing our convertible notes in fiscal 2017 and 2018. fiscal 2018 interest expense also included issuance costs expensed from refinancing of our credit facilities and issuance of the 2025 senior notes and 2028 senior notes in fiscal 2018. these decreases in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by increased interest expense under our 2018 credit agreement due to an increase in libor and average amounts outstanding and net lower gains earned under our interest rate cap agreements that hedge the variable interest rate under our credit facilities in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 21.0% compared to 73.4% in fiscal 2018. our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019, applied to an overall pre-tax loss resulting in a benefit, was equal to the statutory tax rate primarily due to the offsetting impacts of a discrete benefit related to an internal restructuring, earnings in jurisdictions subject to lower tax rates, reserves for uncertain tax positions and releases resulting from statute of limitations expirations and favorable audit settlements, a valuation allowance resulting from the medical aesthetics impairment charge, and finalizing the impact of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act (the "act") in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. as of december 29, 2018, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the act, recording a benefit reduction of $5.0 million in the three months ended december 29, 2018. we recognized a final net benefit amount of $341.2 million related to the act, which was included as a component of income tax expense.
our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018, applied to an overall pre-tax loss resulting in a benefit, differed from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the favorable impact of the tax cuts and jobs act (the "act"), which required us to remeasure our u.s. net deferred tax liabilities at a lower rate, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the medical aesthetics goodwill impairment charge, substantially all of which was non-deductible. the net result of implementing the act was a benefit of $346.2 million representing our best estimate based on our interpretation of the act. as of september 29, 2018, we were still accumulating data to finalize the underlying calculations, and the u.s. treasury was expected to issue further guidance on the application of certain provisions of the act.
segment results of operations we report our business as five segments: diagnostics, breast health, medical aesthetics, gyn surgical and skeletal health. the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report. we measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income. revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above. the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment.

diagnostics revenues increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the increase in product revenues discussed above.
operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increase in gross profit from higher revenues partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. gross margin was 47.3% in the current year compared with 47.1% in the prior year. the increase in gross margin was primarily due to improved molecular diagnostics' gross margin from increased volume of aptima assays and lower amortization expense, partially offset by lower thinprep pap test and perinatal volumes, unfavorable manufacturing variances, lower gross margins on blood screening revenues, and the negative foreign currency impact of the strengthening u. s. dollar.
operating expenses increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the $10.5 million settlement charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 related to the enzo litigation, an increase in marketing initiatives and trade shows, an increase in consulting spend and higher sales expense partially offset by lower compensation expense due to a decrease in headcount, lower clinical trial expenses based on the timing of projects, a reduction in legal fees, lower restructuring costs and lower amortization expense.

breast health revenues increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increase of $78.3 million in product revenue and a $17.7 million in service and other revenue as discussed above.
operating income for this business segment was consistent in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increase in gross profit from higher revenue offset by an increase in operating expenses in the current year. the overall gross margin decreased to 57.8% in the current year compared to 60.2% in the prior year primarily due to a $12.9 million increase in amortization expense from the faxitron and focal acquisitions, the fair value adjustment related to focal inventory of $7.1 million, an increase in lower margin service revenue, increased service costs related primarily to spare parts, tariff costs in china, lower software sales and the negative foreign currency impact of the strengthening u. s. dollar. these reductions in gross margins were partially offset by favorable product gross margins from sales volume increases in the 3dimensions and 3d performance systems, which have higher average selling prices, and an increase in license revenue.
operating expenses increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 due to an increase in compensation from higher headcount in the breast health segment, the inclusion of expenses from the faxitron and focal acquisitions aggregating $29.4 million, increased travel expenses, increased r&d project expenses, higher acquisition related expenses including integration, a $1.7 million increase to contingent consideration related to faxitron, increased commissions from higher sales. these increases were partially offset by lower legal expenses as a result of a benefit from settling the fuji litigation and lower activity in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018.

operating loss as a % of segment revenue   (247.5            )%          (249.1            )%
medical aesthetics revenue decreased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to decrease of $25.5 million in product revenue discussed above, partially offset by increase of $1.9 million in service revenue.
the operating loss in fiscal 2019 included intangible asset and equipment impairment charges of $443.8 million and $241.6 million recorded in the second quarter and fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, respectively. the operating loss in fiscal 2018 included impairment charges aggregating $731.7 million for goodwill and an in-process research and development intangible asset recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. excluding the impairment charges, the operating loss for this business segment would have been $95.8 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $113.0 million in fiscal 2018, a decrease of $17.2 million. the reduction of the operating loss was primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses partially offset by a reduction in gross profit from lower revenues. gross margin, excluding impairment charges, decreased primarily due to lower sales volume of our higher margin monalisa touch device and sculpsure laser and related pac keys, higher sales of lower margin icon and tempsure systems, unfavorable manufacturing variances, an increase in inventory reserves, increased service costs, and tariffs in china. these decreases in gross profit were partially offset by the effect of the revenue reversal of $6.8 million in the prior year period related to the tempsure vitalia voluntary recall.
offsetting the decrease in gross profit, operating expenses other than impairment charges were lower in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to a decrease in compensation related to lower headcount across the organization from attrition and initiatives to right-size spending relative to operating results, lower depreciation expense as the prior year period included accelerated depreciation expense related to the abandonment of cynosure's sap erp system, a reduction in restructuring and integration charges, lower amortization expense as a result of impairing the intangible assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, lower marketing initiative spend, lower travel and trade show spend, and lower consulting, partially offset by an increase in legal fees.

gyn surgical revenues increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 due to the increase in product revenues discussed above.
operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the inclusion of a legal settlement charge of $34.8 million related to settling the smith & nephew patent infringement lawsuit related to the myosure system in fiscal 2018. excluding the impact of the smith & nephew settlement, operating income increased $6.1 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increased gross profit driven by higher revenue. gross margin increased to 64.3% in the current year compared to 63.1% in the prior year primarily due to lower amortization expense, increased volumes and favorable manufacturing variances.
excluding the impact of the smith & nephew settlement, operating expenses increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increased compensation from higher sales headcount and increased commissions, a $4.5 million charge in research and development expenses related to the purchase of certain intellectual property in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, higher research project spend and because the prior year period included a $3.2 million benefit related to the resolution of a tax matter, partially offset by a decrease in marketing initiatives.

we generated a 4.2% increase in product revenues in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to our acquisition of cynosure on march 22, 2017 and an increase in breast health sales. cynosure's results (after the date of the acquisition) are reported in our medical aesthetics segment. cynosure is the sole business in this segment. partially offsetting the increase, our diagnostics business product revenues declined as a result of the sale of our blood screening business effective january 31, 2017, and we had lower revenues in gyn surgical. excluding blood screening, diagnostics revenues increased $46.6 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. in addition, fiscal 2018 was a 52-week year compared to a 53-week year in fiscal 2017.
diagnostics product revenues decreased 3.6% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the decrease in blood screening revenues of $88.2 million in the fiscal 2018 as a result of the divestiture of the business during the second quarter of fiscal 17. in connection with the divestiture agreement, we committed to providing grifols manufacturing support through the defined transition services period and long term access to panther instrumentation and certain supplies. product revenue under the long term supply agreement and transition services agreement to manufacture assays for grifols was $45.4 million and $37.1 million for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. excluding the divestiture of the blood screening business, diagnostic product revenues grew driven by increases in molecular diagnostics of $43.6 million in fiscal 2018, while cytology & perinatal revenues were slightly higher by $3.0 million year over year primarily due to higher international sales volume.
molecular diagnostics product revenue was $601.2 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $557.6 million in fiscal 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to sales of our aptima family of assays on a worldwide basis due to our increased installed base of panther instruments, which is driving higher volumes of assay testing. in addition, we had an increase in the number of our virology products, as we received additional international regulatory approvals. these increases were partially offset by a slight decline in average selling prices, lower instrument sales and the loss of one week in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. cytology & perinatal product revenue increased due to higher international thinprep volumes, partially offset by lower domestic thinprep test volumes, which we primarily attribute to screening internal expansion, as well as a slight decline in average selling prices on a worldwide basis.
breast health product revenues increased 7.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to increased unit volumes of our newest 3dimensions, which also have higher average selling prices, and 3d performance systems, both of which complement our older 3d systems, increased sales volume of our affirm prone table and brevera breast biopsy system, which was recently commercially released in the u.s., an increase in eviva and atec volumes internationally, and the positive foreign currency exchange impact of the weakening u.s. dollar against a number of currencies. in addition, the acquisition of medicor and emsor, former distributors of our products, resulted in higher mammography system revenues, primarily attributable to higher direct sales prices in their respective territories. these increases were partially offset by lower sales volume of our 2d dimensions systems on a worldwide basis and lower 3d upgrades primarily as a result of a shift to 3d systems.
our medical aesthetics business commenced in fiscal 2017 as a result of the acquisition of cynosure effective march 22, 2017. product revenue increased 56.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to year over year increases in body contouring, skin, women's health and other product revenues as fiscal 2018 was a full year period compared to slightly more than six months of activity in fiscal 2017. the fourth quarter and annual period were affected by our decision to voluntary recall the tempsure vitalia system in response to a letter we received from the fda expressing concerns regarding "vaginal rejuvenation" procedures using energy-based devices, which specifically mentioned our monalisa touch laser. we believed our monalisa touch laser had the appropriate fda approvals. however, in considering the fda's broader concerns we elected to suspend marketing and distribution of our tempsure vitalia handpieces and single-use probes until we have assessed the implications of recent fda considerations for devices in this category. as a result, we requested our customers to return any vitalia handpieces and unused probes they purchased and we recorded a $6.8 million reserve to revenue for issuing refunds and rebates.
gyn surgical product revenues decreased 1.2% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower novasure system sales of $25.0 million from lower u.s. volumes partially offset by an increase in myosure system sales on a worldwide basis of $14.6 million. we attributed the decrease in novasure sales primarily to increased competition and a stagnant market for endometrial ablation, partially offset by a slight increase in average selling prices from a mix shift to the higher priced novasure advanced device. in addition, fiscal 2018 was a 52-week year compared to a 53-week year in fiscal 2017. offsetting these decreases is the positive effect of foreign currency exchange rates from a weaker u.s. dollar.
skeletal health product revenues increased 3.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher sales volume of our horizon osteoporosis assessment product revenues in the u.s., which was partially offset by a decrease in our mini c-arm sales, which we attributed primarily to competitive pressures.
in fiscal 2018, 74.2% of product revenues were generated in the united states, 12.0% in europe, 9.0% in asia-pacific, and 4.8% in other international markets. in fiscal 2017, 76.7% of product revenues were generated in the united states, 10.3% in europe, 8.5% in asia-pacific, and 4.5% in other international markets. the slight decrease in the percentage of u.s. revenues was primarily due higher revenues in other international markets as a result of our cynosure, medicor, and emsor acquisitions, and increased international sales volume of 3dimensions systems, thinprep pap tests and aptima products in europe and asia-pacific.

service and other revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service, installation and repair of our products. the majority of these revenues are generated within our breast health segment, and to a lesser extent, our medical aesthetics business. the breast health business continues to convert a high percentage of our installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon expiration of the warranty period. our medical aesthetics business represented 10.6% and 5.6% of service and other revenues in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. service and other revenues increased 10.2% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher service contract conversion and renewal rates, higher spare parts sales, and the cynosure acquisition contributing an additional $31.5 million of revenue due to a full year of operations in fiscal 2018 compared to slightly more than six months of activity in fiscal 2017. partially offsetting these increases was the prior year included $9.5 million of non-recurring royalty revenue recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.

cost of product revenues. the cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues was 33.5% in fiscal 2018, compared to 34.7% in fiscal 2017. cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues in fiscal 2018 was lower than fiscal 2017 primarily due to the acquisition of cynosure in the prior year and the related impact of stepping-up the acquired inventory to fair value in purchase accounting, resulting in additional costs of $39.3 million in fiscal 2017.
diagnostics' product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to increased aptima assay volumes and higher volumes of our newer virology products, partially offset by an increase in international sales which have lower average selling prices and the divestiture of the higher margin blood screening business that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. the products that we supply to grifols under the supply and collaboration agreements are at significantly lower gross margins than we earned in the disposed business.
breast health's product costs as a percentage of revenue increased slightly in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to decrease in 3d upgrades and c-view software sales, which have higher gross margins than capital equipment sales, lower average sales prices of 3d dimensions systems in the u.s. from a mix shift to our lower margin 3d performance system and increase in the sales volume of digital mammography systems internationally, which have lower average selling prices. the decreases were partially offset by higher sales volume of the new 3dimensions system, affirm prone table and the brevera breast biopsy system, higher average selling prices for eviva and atec devices.
medical aesthetics product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the impact of the step-up in inventory recorded in fiscal 2017 from the application of purchase accounting. partially offsetting this impact, in the current year we recorded a revenue reserve for the tempsure vitalia recall of $6.8 million and additional inventory charges.
gyn surgical's product costs as a percentage of revenue increased slightly in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower novasure volumes and continued mix shift to myosure products comprising a higher percentage of gyn surgical product sales. myosure devices have a lower gross margin than novasure devices. in addition, we had higher international sales which have lower average selling prices.
skeletal health's product costs as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to unfavorable manufacturing variances and to a lesser extent pricing pressures on our horizon system.
amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets relates to acquired developed technology. these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 8 and 15 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed. amortization expense increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase of $36.2 million related to intangible assets acquired in the cynosure acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense related to the divestiture of the blood screening business of $5.4 million, lower amortization expense related to the cytyc acquisition intangibles, which are being amortized based on the pattern of economic benefits, and having one less week of expense in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.

service and other revenues gross margin was 45.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to 50.3% in fiscal 2017. the decrease in gross margin is primarily related to the lower margin cynosure service business being a higher percentage of the overall service business in fiscal 2018 from a full year of operations, the inclusion in fiscal 2017 of $9.5 million of non-recurring royalty revenue that had no corresponding costs, and to a lesser extent an increase in costs to repair older digital mammography systems under service contracts in our breast health business. the decrease was partially offset by the breast health business continued strength to convert a high percentage of our installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon expiration of the warranty period leveraging our service infrastructure.

** - percentage not meaningful research and development expenses. research and development expenses decreased 6.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower project spend, including development materials and clinical spending, a reduction of outside consulting spend across the divisions and a reduction in headcount primarily in diagnostics, breast health and medical aesthetics. expenses were also lower in fiscal 2018 primarily due to the divestiture of the blood screening business and one less week of expenses partially offset by an increase of cynosure research and development expenses of $9.0 million due to a full year in fiscal 2018 compared to slightly more than six months of activity in the prior year. at any point in time, we have a number of different research projects and clinical trials being conducted and the timing of these projects and related costs can vary from period to period.
selling and marketing expenses. selling and marketing expenses increased 9.2% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of cynosure, which increased $49.9 million in fiscal 2018 representing a full year of activity; however, headcount was lower compared to the prior year as this business's expenses were aligned to reflect its operating results. excluding cynosure, selling and marketing expenses related to hologic's legacy business decreased $5.0 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower marketing initiatives and consulting expenses, lower spend on travel, a decline in sales personnel headcount in diagnostics and one less week of expenses, partially offset by higher salary compensation from increased headcount in breast health and to a lesser extent gyn surgical, and an increase in commissions and third-party commissions primarily in breast health.
general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased 6.6% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of cynosure, which increased $22.1 million in fiscal 2018 representing a full year of activity; however, headcount has been reduced as this business is integrated into our corporate structure. excluding the impact of cynosure, expenses related to hologic's legacy business increased slightly in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to increased legal fees including settling the smith & nephew patent infringement lawsuit related to the myosure system for $34.8 million, fees incurred in the fuji and minerva lawsuits, increased international infrastructure costs, increased bad debt expense primarily from international and cynosure customers, higher tax consulting and accounting fees and increased information systems infrastructure and project costs. these increases were partially offset by lower costs in fiscal 2018 as fiscal 2017 expenses included a $23.2 million net charge for non-income tax related matters, which was net of the benefit from the medical device excise tax refunds, acquisition and divestiture transaction expenses of $23.2 million, higher integration and consolidation charges primarily related to the cynosure acquisition, and the prior year period included an additional week of expenses.
amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships, trade names, distributor relationships and business licenses related to our acquisitions. these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 2 and 30 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows. amortization expense decreased 5.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower amortization from intangible assets related to the blood screening business of $10.4 million that was disposed of in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and one less week of expenses. this decrease was partially offset by an increase of $8.9 million of amortization expense related to cynosure intangible assets, and increases from the medicor and emsor acquisitions.
impairment of intangible asset. in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we decided to cancel and abandon an in-process research and development project that was recorded as an intangible asset in the cynosure acquisition purchase accounting. the project was abandoned due to unsuccessful clinical results. as a result, we recorded a $46.0 million impairment charge to write-off the full value of the asset.
impairment of goodwill. during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, in connection with commencing our company-wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process, evaluating the current operating performance of our medical aesthetics reporting unit, and abandoning an in-process research and development project, we reduced the short term and long term revenue and operating income forecasts and determined that indicators of impairment existed in our medical aesthetics reporting unit. the medical aesthetics reporting unit is solely comprised of the cynosure business, which we acquired on march 22, 2017. the updated forecast reflected significantly reduced volume and market penetration projections resulting in lower short-term and long-term profitability than expected at the time of the cynosure acquisition. as a result of these current events and circumstances, we determined that it was more likely than not that this change would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit, we utilized the income approach. the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow (dcf) analysis and calculates the fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to the reporting unit and then discounting the after-tax cash flows to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. assumptions used in the dcf require significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. the forecasted cash flows were based on our most recent budget and strategic plan. for the period beyond the strategic plan period, our estimates were based on assumed growth rates expected as of the measurement date. we believed our assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying business. the discount rate used was intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections and was based on an estimate of the weighted average cost of capital (wacc) of market participants relative to the reporting unit. the basis of fair value for medical aesthetics assumed the reporting unit would be purchased or sold in a non-taxable transaction, and the discount rate of 12.0% applied to the after-tax cash flows was consistent with that used in the purchase accounting performed in fiscal 2017. for additional information pertaining to impairment of goodwill, please refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report.
gain on sale of business. in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed the sale of our blood screening business to grifols and recorded a gain of $899.7 million.
restructuring charges. in fiscal 2016, we implemented organizational changes to our international operations. in fiscal 2017, in connection with our acquisition of cynosure, we implemented certain organizational changes, and we also eliminated certain research and development positions in breast health and manufacturing positions primarily in our diagnostics division. in fiscal 2018, we finalized our decision to consolidate legacy international accounting and customer service organizations into our manchester, uk location and will be eliminating positions in belgium, france, italy, spain and germany. this transition was completed in fiscal 2019. we also eliminated certain sales and marketing personnel in our diagnostics and medical aesthetics divisions. additionally, we decided to close our hicksville, new york facility which manufactures certain cynosure products and the employees were notified of termination and related benefits in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. pursuant to u.s. gaap, the related severance and benefit charges were recognized either ratably over the respective required employee service periods or up-front for contractual benefits. in fiscal 2018 and 2017, we recorded aggregate charges of $14.2 million and $13.3 million, respectively, from these actions, primarily for severance and benefits and to a lesser extent lease obligation charges for facility closure costs. for additional information, please refer to note 6 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report.

interest expense in fiscal 2018 and 2017 consists primarily of the cash interest costs and the related amortization of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs on our outstanding debt. interest expense in fiscal 2018 decreased compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to refinancing our 2022 senior notes with our 2025 and 2028 senior notes that carry lower rates, extinguishing our convertible notes in fiscal 2017 and 2018, receiving interest payments under our interest rate cap agreements, and fiscal 2017 included an additional week of expense. these decreases were partially offset by issuance costs expensed from the refinancing of our credit facilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, issuance costs expensed from the issuance of the 2025 senior notes and 2028 senior notes in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and an increase in the libor rate under our amended and restated credit agreement.

in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we entered into the 2017 credit agreement with bank of america, n.a. the proceeds under the 2017 credit agreement of were used to pay off the term loan and revolver outstanding under the prior credit agreement. in connection with this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $1.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we completed private placement of $1.0 billion aggregate principal of senior notes allocated between the 2025 senior notes and 2028 senior notes. the proceeds under the 2025 senior notes and 2028 senior notes offering and our available cash were used to redeem the 2022 senior notes in the same principal amount. in connection with this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $44.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
on various dates during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, we entered into privately negotiated repurchase transactions and extinguished $117.9 million and $168.0 million principal amount of our 2012 and 2013 notes, respectively, for an aggregate payment of $375.1 million, which includes a premium conversion resulting from our stock price on the date of the transactions being in excess of the conversion prices. in connection with these transactions, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $0.9 million and $2.3 million on the 2012 and 2013 notes, respectively, related to the difference between the fair value of their respective liability components and carrying values at the repurchase dates. the remaining cash payments were allocated to the reacquisition of the equity component and recorded within additional paid-in capital, a component of stockholders' equity.

in fiscal 2018, this account primarily consisted of net foreign currency exchange gains of $5.9 million primarily due to hedging activities, a gain of $3.2 million on the cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our deferred compensation plan, partially offset by a realized loss of $0.6 million on the sale of a marketable security.
in fiscal 2017, this account primarily consisted of a gain of $4.9 million on the cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our deferred compensation plan, $2.3 million in net foreign currency exchange gains partially due to hedging activities and $5.6 million of net realized gains on the sale of investments.

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 73.4% compared to 38.6% in fiscal 2017. our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018, applied to an overall pre-tax loss resulting in a benefit, was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to the favorable impact of the tax cuts and jobs act (the "act"), which required us to remeasure our u.s. net deferred tax liabilities at a lower rate, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the medical aesthetics goodwill impairment charge, substantially all of which is non-deductible. the net result of implementing the act was a benefit of $346.2 million representing our best estimate based on our interpretation of the act.
our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to non-deductible goodwill related to the sale of the blood screening business, partially offset by the release of valuation allowances for capital losses utilized against the capital gain generated on the sale of the blood screening business, earnings in jurisdictions subject to lower tax rates, the domestic production activities deduction benefit, the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to statutes of limitations expirations and audit settlements, stock compensation benefits, and federal and state tax credits.

diagnostics revenues decreased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the decrease in product revenues discussed above. the primary driver of the reduction in revenues was the divestiture of the blood screening business in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
operating income for this business segment decreased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to fiscal 2017 including a one-time gain on the disposition of the blood screening business of $899.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and a decrease in gross profit in fiscal 2018 primarily due to the blood screening divestiture. excluding the impact of the gain from this divestiture, operating income decreased $9.0 million in the current year compared to the prior year primarily due to the blood screening divestiture, partially offset by the improvements in sales of our aptima assays. gross margin was 47.1% in the current year compared with 47.8% in the prior year. the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower revenues as a result of the disposition of the higher-margin blood screening business and lower margins generated under the new supply and collaboration arrangement with grifols. this gross margin decrease was partially offset by the impact of the increase in aptima assay volumes, and lower amortization expense.
exclusive of the impact of the gain on the sale of the blood screening business, operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower amortization expense primarily as a result of the blood screening divestiture, lower research and development expenses related to a reduction in project spending as well as the divestiture of the blood screening business, lower headcount in research and development and sales, no disposition transaction fees in fiscal 2018, and one less week of expenses in fiscal 2018, partially offset by restructuring charges for fiscal 2018. in addition, fiscal 2017 included a $5.5 million credit related to a refund received from amending our medical device excise tax filings.

breast health revenues increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase of $50.4 million in product revenue discussed above and $29.5 million in service revenue.
operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase in gross profit from higher revenue partially offset by an increase in operating expenses in the current year. the overall gross margin decreased slightly to 60.2% in the current year compared to 60.9% in the prior year primarily due to the increase in service revenue which has lower margins, decrease in c-view software and 3d upgrades, which have higher gross margins than capital equipment sales, and an increase in international sales, which have lower average selling prices. the gross margin decreases were partially offset by higher gross margins from sales volume increases in the affirm prone table and the brevera breast biopsy system, and higher average selling prices of eviva and atec devices, and sales volume increase in the 3dimensions and 3d performance systems.
operating expenses increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase in salary compensation from increased headcount in the breast health sales organization as well as higher commissions and third-party commissions as a result of sales growth, an increase in legal expenses for the fuji litigation, increased expenses from the faxitron, medicor and emsor acquisitions, higher restructuring expenses and the fiscal 2017 included a credit of $4.5 million from amending the our medical device excise tax filings partially offset by a reduction in marketing initiatives. these increases in operating expenses were partially offset by one less week of expenses in fiscal 2018 and the fiscal 2017 included charges for non-income tax related matters of $5.8 million.

operating income for this business segment decreased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to increase in operating expense related to a legal settlement charge of $34.8 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. fiscal 2017 also included a charge recorded for non-income tax matters of $26.1 million. excluding the impact of the legal settlement and non-income tax matter, operating income in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 would have increased $2.1 million due to a decrease in operating expenses primarily due to lower compensation from a decrease in sales personnel headcount, lower product development spend, and one less week of expenses in fiscal 2018. gross margin was relatively consistent at 63.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to 63.6% in fiscal 2017. the decline is driven by lower novasure sales, which carry higher gross margins than myosure system sales, partially offset by lower amortization expense.

skeletal health revenues increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the increase in product revenues discussed above.
operating income increased in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower operating expenses. gross margin rate was 39.7% in fiscal 2018 compared to 42.2% in fiscal 2017 primarily due to pricing pressures and negative manufacturing variances. this business also had lower operating expenses from lower research and development project spend, one less week of expenses, and the prior year included facility closure costs incurred for the bedford facility of $4.8 million.
liquidity and capital resources at september 28, 2019, we had working capital of $723.0 million, and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $601.8 million. our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by $64.9 million during fiscal 2019 principally due to cash used in financing and investing activities related to net repayments of debt, repurchases of common stock and net cash paid for acquisitions, partially offset by cash generated through cash flow from our core operating activities.
in fiscal 2019, our operating activities provided us with $649.5 million of cash. we incurred a net loss of $203.6 million which was offset by non-cash intangible asset and equipment impairment charges aggregating $685.4 million, non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization aggregating $463.1 million, stock-based compensation expense of $62.0, and non-cash interest expense of $8.6 million related to our outstanding debt. these adjustments to net loss were partially offset by a decrease in net deferred tax liabilities of $235.7 million primarily from the impairment of intangible assets and to a lesser extent amortization of intangible assets. cash provided by operations included a net cash outflow of $156.3 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. changes in our operating assets and liabilities were driven primarily by an increase in accounts receivable of $76.5 million as a result of an increase in fourth quarter revenues of $52.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and an increase in days sales outstanding, an increase in inventory of $63.0 million primarily to meet anticipated demand, build up safety stock, and launch newer products, and a decrease in accrued expenses of $16.5 million primarily due to the smith & nephew legal settlement payment of $34.8 million partially offset by an increase to the bonus accrual for fiscal 2019. partially offsetting these cash outflows was an increase in deferred revenue of $14.4 million primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue for service contracts as the breast health business continues to convert a high percentage of our installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon expiration of the warranty period.
in fiscal 2019, our investing activities used cash of $280.7 million primarily related to acquisition payments of $110.6 million principally for the focal acquisition, $109.1 million for capital expenditures, which consisted of the placement of equipment under customer usage agreements and purchases of manufacturing equipment and computer hardware, an $18.2 million payment for our investment in ssi and $28.4 million in loans to ssi to assist them in paying off some debt and to support their operations.
in fiscal 2019, our financing activities used cash of $431.5 million, primarily for payments of $1.46 billion to pay off the term loan outstanding under the 2017 credit agreement, $300.0 million of net repayments on amounts borrowed under our revolving credit line, $200.1 million for repurchases of our common stock, and payments of $12.8 million for employee-related taxes withheld for the net share settlement of vested restricted stock units. partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds of $1.5 billion from the term loan under the 2018 credit agreement and $49.8 million from our equity plans, primarily the exercise of stock options.
debt we had total recorded debt outstanding of $3.1 billion at september 28, 2019, which was comprised of our term loan under our 2018 credit agreement of $1.49 billion (principal $1.50 billion), 2025 senior notes of $937.3 million (principal of $950.0 million), 2028 senior notes of $393.9 million (principal of $400.0 million), and amounts outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization program of $234.0 million.
2018 credit agreement on december 17, 2018, we refinanced our term loan and revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement, dated as of december 17, 2018 (the "2018 credit agreement") with bank of america, n.a. in its capacity as administrative agent, swing line lender and l/c issuer, and certain other lenders. the 2018 credit agreement amended and restated our prior credit and guaranty agreement, dated as of october 3, 2017 ("2017 credit agreement").
the credit facilities under the 2018 credit agreement consist of:
•   a $1.5 billion secured term loan ("2018 amended term loan") with a maturity date of december 17, 2023; and
•   a secured revolving credit facility ("2018 amended revolver"; together with the 2018 amended term loan, the "amended credit facilities") under which the company may borrow up to $1.5 billion, subject to certain sublimits, with a maturity date of december 17, 2023.
borrowings made under the 2018 credit agreement, bear interest, at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. the applicable margin is based upon our total net leverage ratio as defined in the 2018 credit agreement. as of september 28, 2019, we had no amounts outstanding under our 2018 amendment revolver and the interest rate under our term loan was 3.43%.
we are required to make scheduled principal payments under the 2018 amended term loan in increasing amounts ranging from $9.375 million per three-month period commencing with the three-month period ending on december 27, 2019 to $28.125 million per three-month period commencing with the three-month period ending on december 29, 2022 and ending on september 29, 2023. the remaining balance of the 2018 amended term loan after the scheduled principal payments, which is $1.2 billion as of september 28, 2019, and any amounts outstanding under the 2018 amended revolver are due at maturity. in addition, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the 2018 credit agreement, we may be required to make certain mandatory prepayments from the net proceeds of specified types of asset sales (subject to certain reinvestment rights), debt issuances and insurance recoveries (subject to certain reinvestment rights). these mandatory prepayments are required to be applied by us, first, to the 2018 amended term loan, second, to any outstanding amount under any swing line loans, third, to the 2018 amended revolver, fourth to prepay any outstanding reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of credit and fifth, to cash collateralize any letters of credit. subject to certain limitations, the company may voluntarily prepay any of the 2018 credit facilities without premium or penalty.
borrowings are secured by first-priority liens on, and a first-priority security interest in, substantially all of the assets of the company and its u.s. subsidiaries, with certain exceptions. for example, borrowings under the 2018 credit agreement are not secured by those accounts receivable that are transferred to the special purpose entity under our accounts receivable securitization program.
the 2018 credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customarily applicable to senior secured credit facilities, including covenants restricting our ability, subject to negotiated exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness and grant additional liens on its assets, engage in mergers or acquisitions or dispose of assets, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, pay dividends or make other distributions, voluntarily prepay other indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliated persons, make investments, and change the nature of their businesses. in addition, the 2018 credit agreement requires us to maintain certain financial ratios. the 2018 credit agreement also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross defaults and an event of default upon a change of control of the company.
the 2018 credit agreement contains two financial covenants (a total net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio) measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. as of september 28, 2019, we were in compliance with these covenants.
2025 senior notes the total aggregate principal balance of 2025 senior notes is $950.0 million. the 2025 senior notes are general senior unsecured obligations of the company and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of the company's domestic subsidiaries. the 2025 senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of october 10, 2017 and a supplement to such indenture, dated as of january 19, 2018, each among the company, the guarantors and wells fargo bank, national association, as trustee. the 2025 senior notes mature on october 15, 2025 and bear interest at the rate of 4.375% per year, payable semi-annually on april 15 and october 15 of each year, commencing on april 15, 2018. we may redeem the 2025 senior notes at any time prior to october 15, 2020 at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date and a make-whole premium set forth in the indenture. we may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 senior notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at any time and from time to time before october 15, 2020, at a redemption price equal to 104.375% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. we also have the option to redeem the 2025 senior notes on or after: october 15, 2020 through october 14, 2021 at 102.188% of par; october 15, 2021 through october 14, 2022 at 101.094% of par; and october 15, 2022 and thereafter at 100% of par. in addition, if there is a change of control coupled with a decline in ratings, as provided in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder's 2025 senior notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.
2028 senior notes the total aggregate principal balance of the 2028 senior notes is $400.0 million. the 2028 senior notes are general senior unsecured obligations of the company and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of the company's domestic subsidiaries. the 2028 senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of january 19, 2018, among the company, the guarantors and wells fargo bank, national association, as trustee. the 2028 senior notes mature on february 1, 2028 and bear interest at the rate of 4.625% per year, payable semi-annually on february 1 and august 1 of each year, commencing on august 1, 2018. we may redeem the 2028 senior notes at any time prior to february 1, 2023 at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date and a make-whole premium set forth in the indenture. we may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 senior notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at any time and from time to time before february 1, 2021, at a redemption price equal to 104.625% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. we also have the option to redeem the 2028 senior notes on or after: february 1, 2023 through february 1, 2024 at 102.312% of par; february 1, 2024 through february 1, 2025 at 101.541% of par; february 1, 2025 through february 1, 2026 at 100.770% of par; and february 1, 2026 and thereafter at 100% of par. in addition, if there is a change of control coupled with a decline in ratings, as provided in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder's 2028 senior notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.
accounts receivable securitization program on april 25, 2016, we entered into a one-year $200.0 million accounts receivable securitization program (the "securitization program") with several of our wholly owned subsidiaries and certain financial institutions. under the terms of the securitization program, we and certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries sell our customer receivables to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which is wholly-owned by us. in addition, we also contributed a portion of our customer receivables to the special purpose entity in connection with its establishment. we retain servicing responsibility. the special purpose entity, as borrower, and we, as servicer, have entered into a credit and security agreement with several lenders pursuant to which the special purpose entity may borrow from the lenders up to the maximum borrowing amount allowed, with the loans secured by the receivables. the amount that the special purpose entity may borrow at a given point in time is determined based on the amount of qualifying receivables that are present in the special purpose entity at such point in time. the assets of the special purpose entity secure the amounts borrowed and cannot be used to pay our other debts or liabilities.
we extended the program for an additional year in april 2017 and again in april 2018. effective april 18, 2019, we entered into another amendment to extend the securitization program an additional year to april 17, 2020. under the amendment, the maximum borrowing amount increased from $225.0 million to $250.0 million. as of september 28, 2019, $234.0 million was outstanding under this program.
borrowings outstanding under the securitization program bear interest at libor plus the applicable margin of 0.7% and are included as a component of current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, while the accounts receivable securing these obligations remain as a component of net receivables in our consolidated balance sheet. as of september 28, 2019, the interest rate under the securitization program was 2.76% on the outstanding amounts. we and the special purpose entity are operated and maintained as separate legal entities. the assets of the special purpose entity secure the amounts borrowed and cannot be used to pay our other debts or liabilities. the special purpose entity was not a guarantor under our credit agreement and is not a guarantor under our amended and restated credit agreement or of our 2022 and 2025 senior notes.
the credit and security agreement contains customary representations and warranties and events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, and an event of default upon a change of control. in addition, it contains financial covenants consistent with that of the credit agreement. as of september 28, 2019, the company was in compliance with the credit and security agreement covenants.
investment in ssi on august 1, 2019, we acquired 46% of the outstanding shares of ssi for $18.2 million. in september 2019, we launched a cash tender offer to acquire the remaining shares outstanding, which we expect will be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. as of september 28, 2019, the value of the remaining shares at the cash tender offer price was approximately $20.9 million. effective november 21, 2019, we acquired an additional 7.6 million shares for $12.5 million. as a result, we own approximately 78% of the outstanding shares and will launch a second tender offer with similar terms to acquire the remaining shares.
stock repurchase program on june 13, 2018, the board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan to repurchase up to $500.0 million of our outstanding common stock. this share repurchase plan, which replaced the prior plan, was effective august 1, 2018 and expires on june 13, 2023. under this authorization, during fiscal 2019, we repurchased 4.8 million shares of our common stock for a total consideration of $200.1 million. as of september 28, 2019, $211.5 million was available under this authorization.
on november 19, 2019, our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to $205 million of our outstanding shares, to be in addition to the prior authorization. pursuant to this authorization, we entered into a definitive agreement to conduct a $205 million accelerated share repurchase. on november 25, 2019, we have initially repurchased 3.3 million shares pursuant to this arrangement, subject to adjustment on the settlement date pursuant to customary terms.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of september 28, 2019:

(1)   the financing leases represent two leases for two separate manufacturing facilities, which were required to be recorded on our balance sheet under u.s. gaap. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report.
(2)   purchase obligations primarily represent minimum purchase commitments for inventory and instruments and, to a lesser extent, other operating expense commitments.
(3)   pension obligations do not include our obligation under our deferred compensation plans of $51.9 million at september 28, 2019, which is recorded as a current liability. deferred compensation plan benefits are generally paid out at retirement or termination of employment.
the above table does not reflect our long-term liabilities associated with reserves for uncertain tax positions recorded under fin 48 (codified primarily in asc 740, income taxes) totaling $101.6 million. due to the complexity associated with tax uncertainties, we cannot reasonably make a reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle these non-current liabilities. see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report for more information on our unrecognized tax benefits.
future liquidity considerations we expect to continue to review and evaluate potential strategic transactions (both acquisitions and dispositions) and alliances that we believe will complement or enhance our business and stockholder value. subject to the risk factors set forth in part i, item 1a of this annual report and the general disclaimers set forth in our special note regarding forward-looking statements at the outset of this annual report, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, the cash available under our 2018 amended revolver and our securitization program will provide us with sufficient funds in order to fund our expected normal operations and debt payments over the next twelve months. our longer-term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance. we may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures, repayment of debt, acquisitions, strategic transactions or other investments. as described above, we have significant indebtedness outstanding under our 2018 credit agreement, 2025 senior notes, 2028 senior notes and the securitization program. these capital requirements could be substantial. our operating performance may also be affected by matters discussed under the above-referenced risk factors set forth elsewhere in this report. these risks, trends and uncertainties may also adversely affect our long-term liquidity.
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and claims. in connection with these legal proceedings and claims, management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement, if any, of these proceedings. these estimates are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies. in accordance with asc 450, contingencies, loss contingencies are accrued if, in the opinion of management, an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated. it is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings.
guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements, allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventories, valuations, purchase price allocations and contingent consideration related to business combinations, expected future cash flows including growth rates, discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets and goodwill, estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill, amortization methods and periods, warranty reserves, certain accrued expenses, restructuring and other related charges, stock-based compensation, contingent liabilities, tax reserves and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate. any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
the following is a discussion of what we believe to be the more significant critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
inventory our inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. as a developer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment and diagnostic test kits, we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage. our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions. although considerable effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or expected usage could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results.
business combinations we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition. contingent consideration, which is not deemed to be linked to continuing employment, is recorded at fair value as measured on the date of acquisition. the value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections under various potential scenarios, which are generally probability weighted as to the outcome of each scenario. these cash flow projections are discounted with a risk adjusted rate. quarterly until such contingent amounts are earned, the fair value of the liability is reassessed at each reporting period and adjusted as a component of operating expenses based on changes to the underlying assumptions. the estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment and actual results are likely to differ from the amounts originally recorded.
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management's best estimate of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill.
we generally use the income approach in which cash flow projections on an after-tax basis are discounted using a risk adjusted rate to determine the estimated fair value of certain identifiable intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research and development projects, customer relationships, and trade names.
with respect to property, plant and equipment, we estimate the fair value of these assets using a combination of the cost and market approaches, depending on the component. generally, we apply the cost or income approach as the primary methods in estimating the fair value of land and buildings as the market approach is less reliable based on potential significant differences between the property being valued and the potentially comparable sales of similar properties.
goodwill we test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. events that could indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include, but are not limited to current economic and market conditions, including a decline in market capitalization, a significant adverse change in legal factors, business climate, operational performance of the business or key personnel, and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. our annual impairment test date is the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter.
in performing the test, we either use the qualitative assessment permitted by asc 350 or the single step quantitative approach prescribed under asc 350 including amendments under asu 2017-04. under the qualitative approach we consider a number of factors, including the amount by which the previous quantitative test's fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units, the forecasts in our current 5 year strategic plan compared to the forecasts in the previous quantitative test, an evaluation of discount rates, long-term growth rates including the terminal year rate, if tax rates would have significantly changed, an evaluation of current economic factors for both the worldwide economy and specifically the medical device industry, and any significant changes in customer and supplier relationships. we weigh these factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. if after performing a qualitative assessment, indicators are present, or we identify factors that cause us to believe it is appropriate to perform a more precise calculation of fair value, we would move beyond the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.
under the quantitative impairment test, we perform a comparison of the reporting unit's carrying value to its fair value. we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, including an independent valuation to conduct this test. the valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales and ratio comparisons of similar companies. we base the discount rate on the weighted average cost of capital, or wacc, of market participants. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we apply the single step approach under asu 2017-04. as a result of this simplified approach the goodwill impairment is calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value to the extent of the goodwill balance. we adopted this asu in fiscal 2018.
we conducted our fiscal 2019 annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter and utilized the qualitative approach. as a result of completing the qualitative assessment for each of our reporting units, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount and the performance of a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate fair value was unnecessary.
at september 28, 2019, we believe that our reporting units, with goodwill aggregating $2.6 billion, were not at risk of failing step 1 of the goodwill impairment test based on the current forecasts.
if the current economic environment were to deteriorate or if there was a significant negative impact on the factors considered for the qualitative assessment, this would likely result in a lower fair value and we may be required to perform a dcf to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. when there is a deterioration in such factors, this typically results in a higher wacc because market participants would require a higher rate of return. in the dcf as the wacc increases, the fair value decreases. the other significant factor in the dcf is our projected financial information (i.e., amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates) and if these assumptions were to be adversely impacted, this could result in a reduction of the fair value of a reporting unit.
intangible assets intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and stated net of accumulated amortization and impairments. we amortize intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight-line method, or if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be utilized. we evaluate the recoverability of our definite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances or business conditions indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable based on expectations of future undiscounted cash flows for each asset group. if the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, the company estimates the fair value of the assets, generally utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the assets using a risk-adjusted discount rate. to estimate the fair value of the assets, the company uses market participant assumptions pursuant to asc 820.
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of our products, primarily medical imaging systems, aesthetic treatment systems and diagnostic and surgical disposable products, and related services, which are primarily support and maintenance services on our medical imaging systems. see note 3 for further discussion of revenue recognition.
we consider revenue to be earned when all of the following criteria are met: we have a contract with a customer that creates enforceable rights and obligations; promised products or services are identified; the transaction price, or the amount that we expect to receive, including an estimate of uncertain amounts subject to a constraint to ensure revenue is not recognized in an amount that would result in a significant reversal upon resolution of the uncertainty, is determinable; and we have transferred control of the promised items to the customer. a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account in the contract. the transaction price for the contract is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods and services expected to be transferred. a contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, control of the distinct good or service is transferred. transfer of control for our products is generally at shipment or delivery, depending on contractual terms, but occurs when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer which represents the point in time when the customer obtains the use of and substantially all of the remaining benefit of the product. as such, the performance obligation related to product sales is satisfied at a point in time. revenue from support and maintenance contracts and extended warranties are recognized over time based on the contract term, which represents a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods and services given the stand-ready nature of the performance obligations. service revenue related to professional services for installation, training and repairs is recognized as the services are performed based on the specific nature of the service.
we recognize receivables when we have an unconditional right to payment. payment terms are typically 30 days in the u.s. but may be longer in international markets. we treat shipping and handling costs performed after a customer obtains control of the good as a fulfillment cost and record these costs within costs of product revenue when the corresponding revenue is recognized.
some of our contracts have multiple performance obligations. for contracts with multiple performance obligations, we are required to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. we determine the best estimate of standalone selling price using average selling prices over 3 to 12 month periods of data depending on the products or nature of the services coupled with current market considerations. if the product or service does not have a history of sales or if sales volume is not sufficient, we rely on prices set by our pricing committees or applicable marketing department adjusted for expected discounts.
we also place instruments (or equipment) at customer sites but retain title to the instrument (for example, the thinprep processor, thinprep imaging system, and the panther system). the customer has the right to use the instrument for a period of time, and then we recover the cost of providing the instrument through the sales of disposables, namely tests and assays in diagnostics and handpieces in gyn surgical. these types of agreements include an embedded operating lease for the right to use an instrument and no instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument delivery. we recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the embedded lease concurrent with the sale of disposables over the term of the agreement.
income taxes we use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc 740, income taxes. under this method, we recognize deferred income taxes for the future tax consequences of differences between the tax and financial accounting bases of assets and liabilities at each reporting period. we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws applicable to the period in which we expect the differences to affect taxable income. we establish a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
we have recognized $258.1 million in net deferred tax liabilities at september 28, 2019 and $485.3 million at september 29, 2018. the significant reduction was primarily due to intangible asset impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2019. the liabilities primarily relate to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions. the tax assets relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards, accruals and reserves, stock-based compensation, and research credits. we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. while we have considered future taxable income and the character of such income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we could realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made. likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made.
at september 28, 2019, we had $101.6 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest, of which $87.3 million, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate. at september 29, 2018, we had $89.5 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest, of which $79.0 million, if recognized, would have reduced our effective tax rate. the $12.1 million increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits from fiscal 2018 primarily related to our internal restructuring and other current year tax positions, partially offset by audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations. in the next twelve months it is reasonably possible that we will reduce our gross unrecognized tax benefits by up to $13.4 million due to expiring statutes of limitations.
in the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. in our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. while we consider our estimates reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different than amounts reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. if our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report.

16. segment information we provide financial products and services through the following segments: retirement and income solutions, principal global investors, principal international and u.s. insurance solutions. in addition, we have a corporate segment. the segments are managed and reported separately because they provide different products and services, have different strategies or have different markets and distribution channels. the retirement and income solutions segment provides retirement and related financial products and services primarily to businesses, their employees and other individuals. the segment is organized into retirement and income solutions - fee, which includes full service accumulation, trust services, individual variable annuities and revenues and expenses associated with the acquired business; and retirement and income solutions - spread, which includes individual fixed annuities, investment only, pension risk transfer and banking services. the principal global investors segment provides asset management services to our asset accumulation business, our insurance operations, the corporate segment and third party clients. this segment also includes our mutual fund business. the principal international segment has operations in latin america (brazil, chile and mexico) and asia (china, hong kong special administrative region, india and southeast asia). we focus on locations with large middle classes, favorable demographics and growing long-term savings, ideally with voluntary or mandatory pension markets. we entered these locations through acquisitions, start-up operations and joint ventures. the u.s. insurance solutions segment focuses on solutions for individuals and small-to-medium sized businesses and their employees. the segment is organized into specialty benefits insurance, which provides group dental and vision insurance, individual and group disability insurance, critical illness, accident, group life insurance and non-medical fee-for-service claims administration; and individual life insurance, which provides universal life, variable universal life, indexed universal life and traditional life insurance. our corporate segment manages the assets representing capital that has not been allocated to any other segment. financial results of the corporate segment primarily reflect our financing activities (including financing costs), income on capital not allocated to other segments, inter-segment eliminations, income tax risks and certain income, expenses and other adjustments not allocated to the segments based on the nature of such items. results of principal securities, inc. ("psi"), our retail broker-dealer and registered investment advisor ("ria"); robustwealth, inc. ("robustwealth"), our financial technology company; and our exited group medical and long-term care insurance businesses are reported in this segment. effective january 1,
2019, we made changes to the allocation of certain compensation and other expenses and net investment income among the reportable segments. these allocation changes were made as a result of a global financial process improvement project. the expense allocation changes simplify the allocation processes, increase transparency and allow for more effective expense management across the enterprise. the net investment income allocation changes better align our internal capital allocation with enterprise capital targets. segment results for prior periods were recast so they are reported on a comparable basis, with no impact to total company financial results.

16. segment information - (continued)
management uses segment pre-tax operating earnings in evaluating performance, which is consistent with the financial results provided to and discussed with securities analysts. we determine segment pre-tax operating earnings by adjusting u.s. gaap income before income taxes for pre-tax net realized capital gains (losses), as adjusted, pre-tax other adjustments that management believes are not indicative of overall operating trends and certain adjustments related to equity method investments and noncontrolling interest. while these items may be significant components in understanding and assessing the consolidated financial performance, management believes the presentation of pre-tax operating earnings enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting pre-tax earnings attributable to the normal, ongoing operations of the business.
the pre-tax net realized capital gains (losses), as adjusted, excluded from pre-tax operating earnings reflects consolidated u.s. gaap pre-tax net realized capital gains (losses) excluding the following items that are included in pre-tax operating earnings:
●  periodic settlements and accruals on derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments,
●  certain market value adjustments of derivatives and embedded derivatives and
●  certain market value adjustments of derivative instruments used to economically hedge embedded derivatives.
pre-tax net realized capital gains (losses), as adjusted, are further adjusted for:
●  amortization of hedge accounting book value adjustments for certain discontinued hedges,
●  certain hedge accounting market value revenue adjustments,
●  certain market value adjustments to fee revenues,
●  pre-tax net realized capital gains (losses) adjustments related to equity method investments,
●  pre-tax net realized capital gains (losses) adjustments related to sponsored investment funds,
●  recognition of deferred front-end fee revenues for sales charges on retirement and life insurance products and services,
●  related changes in the amortization pattern of dac and related actuarial balances,
●  certain hedge accounting market value expense adjustments and
●  net realized capital gains (losses) distributed.

segment operating revenues reflect consolidated u.s. gaap total revenues excluding:
net realized capital gains (losses), except periodic settlements and accruals on derivatives not designated
●  as hedging instruments and certain market value adjustments of derivative instruments used to economically hedge embedded derivatives, and their impact on:
●  amortization of hedge accounting book value adjustments for certain discontinued hedges,
●  certain hedge accounting market value revenue adjustments,
●  certain market value adjustments to fee revenues,
●  pre-tax net realized capital gains (losses) adjustments related to equity method investments,
●  pre-tax net realized capital gains (losses) adjustments related to sponsored investment funds and
●  recognition of deferred front-end fee revenues for sales charges on retirement and life insurance products and services.
●  pre-tax other adjustments and income taxes of equity method investments and
●  pre-tax other adjustments management believes are not indicative of overall operating trends.
the accounting policies of the segments are consistent with the accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements, with the exception of: (1) pension and other postretirement employee benefits ("opeb") cost allocations, (2) certain expenses deemed to benefit the entire organization and (3) income tax allocations. for purposes of determining pre-tax operating earnings, the segments are allocated the service component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs. the corporate segment reflects the non-service components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs as assumptions are established and funding decisions are managed from a company-wide perspective. additionally, the corporate segment reflects expenses that benefit the entire organization for which the segments are not able to influence the spend. this includes expenses such as public company costs, executive management costs, acquisition and disposition costs, among others. the corporate segment functions to absorb the risk inherent in interpreting and applying tax law. for purposes of determining non-gaap operating earnings, the segments are allocated tax adjustments consistent with the positions we took on tax returns. the corporate segment results reflect any differences between the tax returns and the estimated resolution of any disputes.

17. revenues from contracts with customers - (continued)
principal global investors fees and other revenues earned for asset management, investment advisory and distribution services provided to institutional and retail clients are based largely upon contractual rates applied to the specified amounts of the clients' portfolios. each service is a distinct performance obligation, or a series of distinct services that are a single performance obligation in that the services are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. fees and other revenues received for performance obligations such as asset management and other services are typically recognized over time utilizing the output method as the service is performed. performance fees and transaction fees on certain accounts are recognized in income when the probability of significant reversal will not occur upon resolution of the uncertainty, which could be based on a variety of factors such as market performance or other internal metrics. asset management fees are accrued each month based on the fee terms within the applicable agreement and are generally billed quarterly when values used for the calculation are available.
management fees and performance fees are variable consideration as they are subject to fluctuation based on assets under management ("aum") and other constraints. these fees are not recognized until unconstrained at the end of each reporting period.

each service is considered a distinct performance obligation; however, if the services are not distinct on their own, we combine them into a distinct bundle or we have a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. fees and other revenues are typically based upon contractual rates applied to the market value of the clients' investment portfolios and are considered variable consideration. the transaction price generally includes the amount determined at the end of the reporting period, whereby fees are deducted from the clients' investment portfolios and are recognized as revenue when no longer constrained and satisfied as the services are performed over time utilizing the output method. in addition, payments to customers can take the form of an incentive given by us to entice the customer to purchase its goods or services. incentives offered to customers are recognized as part of the transaction price as a reduction of revenue either over the period the customer remains in order to receive the incentive or monthly throughout the life of the contract.
incentive-based fees are recognized in income when the probability of significant reversal will not occur upon the resolution of the uncertainty, which is based on market performance.
fees for managing customers' mandatory retirement savings accounts in chile are collected with each monthly deposit made by our customers. if a customer stops contributing before retirement age, we collect no fees but services are still provided. we recognize revenue from these contracts as services are performed over the life of the contract and review annually.

contract costs sales compensation and other incremental costs of obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized over the period of contract benefit if the costs are expected to be recovered. the contract cost asset, which is included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial position, was $ million and $ million as of december 31,
2019 and december 31, 2018, respectively.
we apply the practical expedient for certain costs where we recognize the incremental costs of obtaining these contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets is year or less. these costs, along with costs that are not deferrable, are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.
deferred contract costs consist primarily of commissions and variable compensation. we amortize capitalized contract costs on a straight-line basis over the expected contract life, reflecting lapses as they are incurred.
deferred contract costs are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or when a triggering event occurs that could warrant an impairment. to the extent future revenues less future maintenance expenses are not adequate to cover the asset balance, an impairment is recognized. for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, $ million and $ million, respectively, of amortization expense was recorded in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and no impairment loss was recognized in relation to the costs capitalized.
18. stock-based compensation plans as of december 31, 2019, we had the 2014 stock incentive plan, the employee stock purchase plan, the 2014 directors stock plan, the amended and restated 2010 stock incentive plan, the 2005
directors stock plan, the stock incentive plan and the directors stock plan ("stock-based compensation plans"). as of may 20, 2014, nonew grants will be made under the amended and restated 2010 stock incentive plan or the 2005
directors stock plan. no grantshave been made under the stock incentive plan or the directors stock plan since at least 2005. under the terms of the 2014 stock incentive plan, grants may be nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options qualifying under section 422 of the internal revenue code, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units or other stock-based awards. the 2014 directors stock plan provides for the grant of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units or other stock-based awards to our nonemployee directors. to date, we have not granted any incentive stock options, restricted stock or performance units under any plans. as of december 31, 2019, the maximum number of new shares of common stock available for grant under the 2014 stock incentive plan and the 2014 directors stock plan was
6.7million.

nonqualified stock options nonqualified stock options were granted to certain employees under the 2014 stock incentive plan, the amended and restated 2010 stock incentive plan and the stock incentive plan. options outstanding were granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and expire after the grant date.
these options have graded vesting over a period, except in the case of specific types of terminations. total options granted were million, million and million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

the fair value of stock options is estimated using the black-scholes option pricing model. the following is a summary of the assumptions used in this model for the stock options granted during the period:
for the year ended december 31, options                                                                 2019           2018           2017

we determine expected volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using daily price observations and implied volatility from traded options on our common stock. we believe that incorporating both historical and implied volatility into our expected volatility assumption calculation better reflects market expectations. the expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. we determine expected term using historical exercise and employee termination data. the risk-free rate for periods within the expected term of the option is based on the u.s. treasury risk-free interest rate in effect at the time of grant.
the dividend yield is based on historical dividend distributions compared to the closing price of our common shares on the grant date.
as of december 31, 2019, we had $ million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options. the cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average service period of approximately years.
cash received from stock options exercised under these share-based payment arrangements during 2019, 2018 and 2017
was $ million, $ million and $ million, respectively. the actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions for options exercised under these share-based payment arrangements during 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $ million, $ million and $ million, respectively.
performance share awards we granted performance share awards to certain employees under the 2014 stock incentive plan and the amended and restated 2010 stock incentive plan. the performance share awards are treated as an equity award and are paid in shares. whether the performance shares are earned depends upon the participant's continued employment through the performance period (except in the case of specific types of terminations) and our performance against goals set at the beginning of the performance period. performance goals based on various factors must be achieved for any of the performance shares to be earned. if the performance requirements are not met, the performance shares will be forfeited, no compensation cost will be recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed. these awards have no maximum contractual term. dividend equivalents are credited on performance shares outstanding as of the record date. these dividend equivalents are only paid on the shares released. total performance share awards granted were million, million and million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

performance share awards above represent initial target awards and do not reflect potential increases or decreases resulting from the final performance results to be determined at the end of the respective performance period. the actual number of common shares to be awarded at the end of each performance period will range between % and % of the initial target awards.
the fair value of performance share awards is determined based on the closing stock price of our common shares on the grant date. the weighted-average grant-date fair value of performance share awards granted during 2019, 2018
and 2017 was $, $ and $, respectively.

restricted stock units we issue restricted stock units under the 2014 stock incentive plan, the 2014 directors stock plan, the amended and restated 2010 stock incentive plan, the 2005 directors stock plan, the stock incentive plan, and the directors stock plan. restricted stock units are treated as an equity award and are paid in shares. these awards have no maximum contractual term. dividend equivalents are credited on restricted stock units outstanding as of the record date. these dividend equivalents are only paid on the shares released. restricted stock units granted were million, million and million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
restricted stock units were issued to certain employees and agents pursuant to the 2014 stock incentive plan, the amended and restated 2010 stock incentive plan and stock incentive plan. under these plans, awards have graded or cliff vesting over a service period. when service for pfg ceases (except in the case of specific types of terminations), all vesting stops and unvested units are forfeited.
pursuant to the 2014 directors stock plan and the 2005 directors stock plan, restricted stock units are granted to each non-employee director in office immediately following each annual meeting of stockholders and, at the discretion of the nominating and governance committee, to each person who becomes a member of the board other than on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders. under these plans, awards are granted on an annual basis and cliff vest after a service period. when service to pfg ceases, all vesting stops and unvested units are forfeited.

21. condensed consolidating financial information principal life has established special purpose entities to issue secured medium-term notes. under the program, the payment obligations of principal and interest on the notes are secured by funding agreements issued by principal life. principal life's payment obligations on the funding agreements are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by pfg. all of the outstanding stock of principal life is indirectly owned by pfg and pfg is the only guarantor of the payment obligations of the funding agreements. the following tables set forth condensed consolidating financial information of (i) pfg, (ii) principal life, (iii) pfs and all other direct and indirect subsidiaries of pfg on a combined basis and (iv) the eliminations necessary to arrive at the information for pfg on a consolidated basis as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, and for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. in presenting the condensed consolidating financial statements, the equity method of accounting has been applied to (i) pfg's interest in all direct subsidiaries of pfg, (ii)
principal life's interest in all direct subsidiaries of principal life and (iii) pfs's interest in principal life even though all such subsidiaries meet the requirements to be consolidated under u.s. gaap. earnings of subsidiaries are, therefore, reflected in the parent's investment and earnings. all intercompany balances and transactions, including elimination of the parent's investment in subsidiaries, between pfg, principal life and pfs and all other subsidiaries have been eliminated, as shown in the column "eliminations." these condensed consolidating financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements. the financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations, cash flows or financial position had the subsidiaries operated as independent entities. pfg sponsors nonqualified benefit plans for select employees and agents and is responsible for the obligations of these plans. nonqualified plan assets are held in rabbi trusts for the benefit of all nonqualified plan participants. the rabbi trusts are separate legal entities and are not a part of pfg on a stand-alone basis. the plan assets are available to satisfy the claims of general creditors only in the event of bankruptcy and are, therefore, consolidated in our statements of financial position.

(ii) pfs's interest in principal life and all other subsidiaries, where applicable, even though all such subsidiaries meet the requirements to be consolidated under u.s. gaap. earnings of subsidiaries are, therefore, reflected in the parent's investment and earnings. all intercompany balances and transactions, including elimination of the parent's investment in subsidiaries, between pfg, pfs and principal life and all other subsidiaries have been eliminated, as shown in the column "eliminations." these condensed consolidating financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements. the financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations, cash flows or financial position had the subsidiaries operated as independent entities.pfg sponsors nonqualified benefit plans for select employees and agents and is responsible for the obligations of these plans. nonqualified plan assets are held in rabbi trusts for the benefit of all nonqualified plan participants. the rabbi trusts are separate legal entities and are not a part of pfg on a stand-alone basis. the plan assets are available to satisfy the claims of general creditors only in the event of bankruptcy and are, therefore, consolidated in our statements of financial position.

item9a.  controls and procedures disclosure controls and procedures in order to ensure the information we must disclose in our filings with the sec is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis, we have adopted disclosure controls and procedures. disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file with or submit to the sec is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
our chief executive officer, daniel j. houston, and our chief financial officer, deanna d. strable-soethout, have reviewed and evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31, 2019, except as noted below, and have concluded our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
our assessment of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures excludes the operations and related assets of the acquired business, which closed on july 1, 2019. for additional information regarding the acquisition, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, goodwill and other intangible assets". we are in process of evaluating internal control over financial reporting for the acquired business and, accordingly, have excluded its controls from our evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. for the year ended december 31, 2019, the acquired business's revenues related to operations represented 1% of our consolidated total revenues. as of december 31, 2019, the acquired business's assets related to operations represented less than 1% of our consolidated total assets.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting management of principal financial group, inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer, daniel j.
houston, and our chief financial officer, deanna d. strable-soethout, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, except as noted below, based on criteria established in the internal control - integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework). based on our evaluation, management has concluded that principal financial group, inc.'s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2019.
as noted above, we are in the process of evaluating internal control over financial reporting for acquired business and, accordingly, have excluded acquired business from management's report on internal control over financial reporting. see "disclosure controls and procedures" above for additional information.

(1)  allocations of net investment income and certain operating expenses are based on a number of assumptions and estimates. reported operating results would change by segment if different methods were applied.
effective january 1, 2019, we made changes to the allocation of certain compensation and other expenses and net investment income among the reportable segments. these allocation changes were made as a result of a global financial process improvement project. the expense allocation changes simplify the allocation processes, increase transparency and allow for more effective expense management across the enterprise. the net investment income allocation changes better align our internal capital allocation with enterprise capital targets. segment results for prior periods were recast so they are reported on a comparable basis, with no impact to total company financial results.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis discusses our financial condition as of december 31, 2019, compared with december 31, 2018, our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, and, where appropriate, factors that may affect our future financial performance. the discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the financial statements and the other financial information included elsewhere in this form 10-k. forward-looking information our narrative analysis below contains forward-looking statements intended to enhance the reader's ability to assess our future financial performance.
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that represent our beliefs concerning future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments, and contain words and phrases such as
"anticipate," "believe," "plan," "estimate," "expect," "intend," and other similar expressions. forward-looking statements are made based upon management's current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. actual results may differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties. those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risk factors listed in item 1a.
"risk factors." overview we provide financial products and services through the following reportable segments:
●  retirement and income solutions;
●  principal global investors;
●  principal international and
●  u.s. insurance solutions.
we also have a corporate segment, which consists of the assets and activities that have not been allocated to any other segment. see item 1. "business" for a description of our reportable segments. effective january 1, 2019, we made changes to the allocation of certain compensation and other expenses and net investment income among the reportable segments. these allocation changes were made as a result of a global financial process improvement project. the expense allocation changes simplify the allocation processes, increase transparency and allow for more effective expense management across the enterprise. the net investment income allocation changes better align our internal capital allocation with enterprise capital targets. segment results for prior periods were recast so they are reported on a comparable basis, with no impact to total company financial results. economic factors and trends positive market performance and net customer cash flow led to an increase in account values in our retirement and income solutions segment in 2019. account value is the base by which this business generates revenues. the increase in account values contributed to the overall improvement of fee revenues in this segment, in addition to the increase in fee revenues related to the acquired business. positive market performance led to an increase in aum managed by our principal global investors segment in 2019. aum is the primary base by which this business generates revenues. also included in revenues are borrower fees, transaction fees and performance fees which can fluctuate between years. in our principal international segment, we continued to grow our business organically in 2019
through our existing subsidiaries and joint ventures. local currency aum, a key indicator of earnings growth for the segment, increased in 2019 as a result of positive market performance and net customer cash flow. the financial results for the principal international segment are also impacted by fluctuations of the foreign currency to u.s.
dollar exchange rates for the locations in which we have business. aum was negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations in 2019. the u.s. insurance solutions segment has been impacted by lower interest rates in recent years, which has caused spread compression and led to higher reserves. we have mitigated some of the impact through changes in our investment strategy and changes to certain product offerings.

table of contents profitability our profitability depends in large part upon our:
●  amount of aum;
●  ability to manage the difference between the investment income we earn and the interest we credit to policyholders;
●  ability to generate fee revenues by providing trust and custody,administrative and investment management services;
●  ability to price our insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the related expenses;
●  ability to manage our investment portfolio to maximize investment returns and minimize risks such as interest rate changes or defaults or impairments of invested assets;
●  ability to effectively hedge fluctuations in foreign currency to u.s. dollar exchange rates on certain transactions and
●  ability to manage our operating expenses.
critical accounting policies and estimates the increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance requires us to closely monitor our accounting policies. our significant accounting policies are described in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 1, nature of operations and significant accounting policies." we have identified critical accounting policies that are complex and require significant judgment and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. a summary of our critical accounting policies is intended to enhance the reader's ability to assess our financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates and changes in guidance. the identification, selection and disclosure of critical accounting estimates and policies have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors. valuation and impairment of fixed income investments fixed maturities.fixed maturities include bonds, asset-backed securities ("abs"), redeemable preferred stock and certain non-redeemable preferred securities. we classify our fixed maturities as either afs or trading and, accordingly, carry them at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position. volatility in net income can result from changes in fair value of fixed maturities classified as trading. volatility in other comprehensive income can result from changes in fair value of fixed maturities classified as afs. we measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities based on assumptions used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability, which may include inherent risk, restrictions on the sale or use of an asset, or nonperformance risk, including our own credit risk. for additional details concerning the methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note
14, fair value measurements" under the caption, "determination of fair value." the fair values of our public fixed maturities are primarily based on market prices from third party pricing vendors. we have regular interactions with these vendors to ensure we understand their pricing methodologies and to confirm they are utilizing observable market information. in addition, 7% of our invested asset portfolio as of december 31, 2019, was invested in privately placed fixed maturities with no readily available market quotes to determine the fair market value. the majority of these assets are valued using a matrix pricing valuation approach that utilizes observable market inputs. in the matrix approach, securities are grouped into pricing categories that vary by sector, rating and average life. each pricing category is assigned a risk spread based on observable public market data. the expected cash flows of the security are then discounted back at the current treasury curve plus the appropriate risk spread.
although the matrix valuation approach provides a fair valuation of each pricing category, the valuation of an individual security within each pricing category may be impacted by company specific factors. this excludes privately placed securities subject to rule 144a of the securities act of 1933 that are primarily based on market prices from third party pricing vendors, similar to public fixed maturities.
41
table of contents if we are unable to price a fixed maturity security using prices from third party pricing vendors or other sources specific to the asset class, we may obtain a broker quote or utilize an internal pricing model specific to the asset utilizing relevant market information, to the extent available and where at least one significant unobservable input is utilized. these are reflected in level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and can include fixed maturities across all asset classes. as of december 31, 2019, less than 1% of our total fixed maturities were level 3 securities valued using internal pricing models. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 14, fair value measurements" for further discussion.the $4,175.6 million increase in net unrealized gains from u.s. investment operations for the year ended december 31, 2019, can be attributed to an approximate 74 basis point decrease in interest rates and tightening of credit spreads. for additional information about interest rate risk see item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."fixed maturities classified as afs are subject to impairment reviews. when evaluating fixed maturities for impairment, we consider relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether a credit or interest rate-related impairment of a security is other than temporary. relevant facts and circumstances considered include: (1) the extent and length of time the fair value has been below cost; (2) the reasons for the decline in value; (3) the financial position and access to capital of the issuer, including the current and future impact of any specific events; (4) for structured securities, the adequacy of the expected cash flows and (5) our intent to sell a security or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost which, in some cases, may extend to maturity. to the extent we determine a security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired, an impairment loss is recognized. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, investments" under the caption, "other-than-temporary impairments" for further discussion.a number of significant risks and uncertainties are inherent in the process of monitoring credit impairments and determining if an impairment is other than temporary. these risks and uncertainties include: (1) the risk that our assessment of an issuer's ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that issuer; (2) the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated; (3) the risk that our investment professionals are making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers and (4) the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and circumstances lead us to change our intent to not sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost.
any of these situations could result in a charge to net income in a future period. as of december 31, 2019, we had $8,525.0 million in afs fixed maturities with gross unrealized losses totaling $124.0 million. included in the gross unrealized losses are losses attributable to both movements in market interest rates as well as movement in credit spreads.effective january 1, 2020, with the implementation of guidance for measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, a credit loss on fixed maturities classified as afs will be recognized through an allowance for credit losses rather than a direct write-down for other than temporary impairment.mortgage loans.mortgage loans consist primarily of commercial mortgage loans on real estate.
commercial mortgage loans on real estate are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method and net of valuation allowances. these loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to contractual terms of the loan agreement. when we determine a loan is impaired, a valuation allowance is established equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the mortgage loan and the estimated value reduced by the cost to sell. estimated value is based on either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price or fair value of the collateral. subsequent changes in the estimated value are reflected in the valuation allowance. amounts on loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged off and removed from the valuation allowance. the change in the valuation allowance provision is included in net realized capital gains (losses)
on our consolidated statements of operations. for more detailed information concerning mortgage loan valuation allowances and impairments, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, investments" under the caption, "mortgage loan valuation allowance."effective january 1, 2020, with the implementation of guidance for measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, the mortgage loan valuation allowance will be based on the current expected credit loss model. this is not expected to have a material impact on the valuation allowance.
42
table of contents derivatives we use derivatives primarily to hedge or reduce exposure to market risks. the fair values of exchange-
traded derivatives are determined through quoted market prices. exchange-traded derivatives include futures that are settled daily, which reduces their fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position. the fair values of privately negotiated contracts, which are usually referred to as over-the-counter ("otc") derivatives, that are cleared through centralized clearinghouses are determined through market prices published by the clearinghouses. beginning in 2017, variation margin associated with otc cleared derivatives is settled daily, which reduces their fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position. the fair values of non-cleared otc derivatives are determined using either pricing valuation models that utilize market observable inputs or broker quotes. on an absolute fair value basis as of december 31, 2019, 91% of our otc derivative assets and liabilities were valued using pricing valuation models using market observable data and the remaining 9% using broker quotes.
see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 14, fair value measurements" for further discussion. the fair values of our derivative instruments can be impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, equity indices and volatility, as well as other contributing factors. for additional information see item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk." we also issue certain annuity, universal life and other contracts that include embedded derivatives that have been bifurcated from the host contract. they are valued using a combination of historical data and actuarial judgment. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 14, fair value measurements" for further discussion. we include our assumption for own non-
performance risk in the valuation of these embedded derivatives. as our credit spreads widen or tighten, the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities decrease or increase, leading to an increase or decrease in net income. if the current market credit spreads reflecting our own creditworthiness move to zero (tighten), the reduction to net income would be approximately $150.0 million, net of dac and income taxes, based on december 31,
2019, reported amounts. in addition, the policyholder behavior assumptions used in the valuation of embedded derivatives include risk margins, which increase the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities. the accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of the applicable accounting standards continue to evolve. judgment is applied in determining the availability and application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment. judgment and estimates are used to determine the fair value of some of our derivatives. volatility in net income can result from changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting and changes in fair value of embedded derivatives. deferred acquisition costs and other actuarial balances incremental direct costs of contract acquisition as well as certain costs directly related to acquisition activities (underwriting, policy issuance and processing, medical and inspection and sales force contract selling) for the successful acquisition of new and renewal insurance policies and investment contract business are capitalized to the extent recoverable. maintenance costs and acquisition costs that are not deferrable are charged to net income as incurred. amortization based on estimated gross profits.dac for universal life-type insurance contracts and certain investment contracts are amortized over the expected lifetime of the contracts in relation to estimated gross profits ("egps"). in addition to dac, the following actuarial balances are also amortized in relation to egps.
sales inducement asset - sales inducements are amounts that are credited to the contractholder's account
●  balance as an inducement to purchase the contract. like dac, the cost of the sales inducement is capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the contract, in proportion to egps.
unearned revenue liability - an unearned revenue liability is established when we collect fees or other
●  policyholder assessments that represent compensation for services to be provided in future periods. these revenues are deferred and then amortized over the expected life of the contract, in proportion to egps.
reinsurance asset or liability - for universal-life type products that are reinsured, a reinsurance asset or
●  liability is established to spread the expected net reinsurance costs or profits in proportion to the egps on the underlying business.
we also have additional benefit reserves that are established for annuity or universal life-type contracts that provide benefit guarantees or for contracts that are expected to produce profits followed by losses. the liabilities are accrued in relation to estimated contract assessments, and they are based on assumptions and methodologies similar to those used in the calculation of egps. for more information, see "insurance reserves ."
43
table of contents key assumptions used in the calculation of egps include mortality, morbidity, lapses, equity returns, general account investment yields and expenses as well as the change in our liability for certain guarantees and the difference between actual and expected reinsurance premiums and recoveries, depending on the nature of the contract. our general account investment yield assumption reflects our long-term projections of interest rates and net realized capital gains (losses). we develop an estimate of egps at issue and each valuation date. as actual experience and market conditions emerge, the gross profits may vary from those expected either in magnitude or timing, in which case a true-up of actuarial balances occurs as a charge or credit to current net income. in addition, we are required to revise our assumptions regarding future experience if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised; we refer to this as unlocking. both actions, reflecting actual experience and market conditions and changing future estimates, can change both the current amount and the future amortization pattern of the dac asset and related actuarial balances. for individual variable universal life insurance, individual variable annuities and group annuities that have separate account u.s. equity investment options, we utilize a mean reversion methodology (reversion to the mean assumption), a common industry practice, to determine the future domestic equity market growth rate assumption used for the calculation of egps. if actual annualized u.s. equity market performance varies from our 8% long-term assumption, we assume different performance levels in the short-term such that the weighted average return is equal to the long-term assumption over the mean reversion period. however, our mean reversion process generally limits assumed returns to a range of 4-12% during the mean reversion period. for additional details concerning methods of dac amortization see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 1, nature of operations and significant accounting policies" under the caption, "deferred acquisition costs." internal replacements.we review policies for modifications that result in the exchange of an existing contract for a new contract. if the new contract is determined to be an internal replacement that is substantially changed from the replaced contract, any unamortized dac and related actuarial balances are written off and acquisition costs related to the new contract are capitalized as appropriate. if the new contract is substantially unchanged from the replaced contract, we continue to amortize the existing dac and related actuarial balances. recoverability.dac and sales inducement assets are subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issue and loss recognition testing on an annual basis, or when an event occurs that may warrant loss recognition. if loss recognition or impairment is necessary, the asset balances are written off to the extent it is determined that future policy premiums and investment income or gross profits are not adequate to cover the balances. actuarial assumption updates.we periodically review and update actuarial assumptions that are inputs to the models for dac and other actuarial balances and make model refinements as necessary. for more information see "transactions affecting comparability of results of operations -
other - actuarial assumption updates .'' sensitivities.as of december 31, 2019, the net balance of dac and related actuarial balances, excluding balances affected by changes in other comprehensive income ("oci"), was a $527.0
million asset. we perform sensitivity analyses to assess the impact that certain assumptions have on these balances. the following table shows the estimated immediate impact of various assumption changes on our dac and related actuarial balances.

goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets include the cost of acquired subsidiaries in excess of the fair value of the net tangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions. goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; however, are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value using a discounted cash flow approach. intangibles that do not have indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. we formally conduct our annual goodwill and other intangible asset impairment testing during the third quarter. goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is the same level as or one level below the operating segment.
44
table of contents the operating segments and associated reporting units at which we perform our testing are as follows:
●  retirement and income solutions: retirement and income solutions - fee and retirement and income solutions -
spread
●  principal global investors: equity investments, fixed income investments, real estate and other alternative investments, mutual funds complex
●  principal international: latin america and asia
●  u.s. insurance solutions: specialty benefits insurance and individual life insurance
●  corporate: corporate subsidiaries goodwill.u.s. gaap permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-
than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test of the two-step goodwill impairment test. an entity also has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. we perform qualitative assessments for certain reporting units and we elect to proceed directly to a two-step quantitative test for certain reporting units in our evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill. in the qualitative assessment, all relevant events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit are assessed. each assessment uses a five-step approach: determine the starting point, identify the most relevant drivers of fair value, identify events and circumstances, weight the identified factors and conclude. for reporting units that performed a qualitative test, the estimated fair values of all such reporting units were in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired. for reporting units that performed a quantitative test, we concluded the estimated fair values of all such reporting units were in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired. other intangible assets.u.s. gaap permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an intangible asset with an indefinite life is less than its carrying amount to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment. we primarily utilize the qualitative approach for testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives. in doing so, we follow the same qualitative process as for goodwill and weigh the evidence of the events and circumstances and their potential impacts on fair value when determining if it is not more-likely-than-not that the indefinite lived intangible is impaired. intangible assets with finite lives are amortized as related benefits emerge and are reviewed periodically for indicators of impairment in value. if facts and circumstances suggest possible impairment, the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is compared to the current carrying value of the asset. if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of assets over their fair value. for those assets amortized as related benefits emerge, the most significant assumptions involved in the estimation of future benefits include surrender/lapse rates and margins. we did not recognize a material impairment in our 2019
consolidated statement of operations. sensitivities.in connection with our annual impairment testing process, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. we cannot predict certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets that totaled $1,693.8 million and $1,786.7 million, respectively, as of december 31, 2019. such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on our customer base, interest rate movements, declines in the equity markets, the legal environment in which the businesses operate or a material negative change in our relationships with significant customers. for further information see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 1, nature of operations and significant accounting policies," and "note 2, goodwill and other intangible assets." insurance reserves reserves are liabilities representing estimates of the amounts that will come due, at some point in the future, to or on behalf of our policyholders. u.s. gaap, allowing for some degree of managerial judgment, provides guidance for establishing reserves.
45
table of contents future policy benefits and claims include reserves for individual traditional and group life insurance, disability, medical and long-term care insurance and individual and group annuities that provide periodic income payments.
these reserves are computed using assumptions of mortality, morbidity, lapse, investment performance and expense.
these assumptions are based on our experience, industry results, emerging trends and future expectations. for long-
duration insurance contracts, once these assumptions are made for a given policy or group of policies, they will not be changed over the life of the policy. however, significant changes in experience or assumptions may require us to provide for expected future losses on a product by establishing premium deficiency reserves. premium deficiency reserves may also be established for short-duration contracts to provide for expected future losses. our reserve levels are reviewed throughout the year using internal analysis including, among other things, experience studies, claim development analysis and annual loss recognition analysis. to the extent experience indicates potential loss recognition, we recognize losses on certain lines of business. the ultimate accuracy of the assumptions on these long-tailed insurance products cannot be determined until the obligation of the entire block of business on which the assumptions were made is extinguished. short-term variances of actual results from the assumptions used in the computation of the reserves are reflected in current period net income and can impact quarter-to-quarter net income.
future policy benefits and claims also include reserves for incurred but unreported disability, medical, dental, vision, critical illness, accident and life insurance claims. we recognize claims costs in the period the service was provided to our policyholders. however, claims costs incurred in a particular period are not known with certainty until after we receive, process and pay the claims. we determine the amount of this liability using actuarial methods based on historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging cost trends, where applicable, to determine our estimate of claim liabilities. we also look back to assess how our prior periods' estimates developed. to the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period claim expense. historically, the amount of the claim reserve adjustment made in subsequent reporting periods for prior period estimates have been within a reasonable range given our normal claim fluctuations.
future policy benefits and claims also include benefit reserves that are established for annuity or universal life-
type contracts that provide benefit guarantees, or for contracts that are expected to produce profits followed by losses. the liabilities are accrued in relation to estimated contract assessments.
we periodically review and update actuarial assumptions that are used to compute reserves. for more information see
''transactions affecting comparability of results of operations - other - actuarial assumption updates.''
benefit plans the reported expense and liability associated with pension and opeb plans requires the use of assumptions. numerous assumptions are made regarding the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, turnover, expected compensation increases, health care claim costs, health care cost trends, retirement rates and mortality.
the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets have the most significant impact on the level of expense.
the assumed discount rate is determined by projecting future benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligation and discounting those cash flows using a spot yield curve for high quality corporate bonds. our assumed discount rates were 3.25% for our pension plans and 2.95% for our opeb plans as of december 31, 2019. typically, a
0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase the pension benefits projected benefit obligation and the net periodic pension cost ("nppc") by approximately $133.3 million and $2.3 million, respectively. typically, a 0.25%
decrease in the discount rate would increase the opeb accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $2.2 million and would have a nominal impact on the net periodic benefit cost ("npbc"). typically, a
0.25% increase in the discount rate would result in decreases in benefit obligations and expenses at a level generally commensurate with those noted above.
the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is set at the long-term rate expected to be earned based on the long-term investment policy of the plans and the various classes of the invested funds. historical and future expected returns of multiple asset classes were analyzed to develop a risk-free real rate of return and risk premiums for each asset class. the overall long-term rate for each asset class was developed by combining a long-
term inflation component, the real risk-free rate of return and the associated risk premium. a weighted average rate was developed based on long-term returns for each asset class, the plan's target asset allocation policy and the tax structure of the trusts. for the 2019 nppc and 2019 npbc, a 5.95% and 5.19% weighted average long-term rate of return was used, respectively. for the 2020 nppc and 2020 npbc, a 5.60% and 4.94% weighted average long-term rate of return assumption, respectively, will be used. typically, a 0.25% decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return would increase the nppc by approximately $7.0 million and the npbc by approximately $1.8 million. typically, a 0.25% increase in this rate would result in a decrease to expense at the same levels. the assumed return on plan assets is based on the fair market value of plan assets as of december 31, 2019.
46
table of contents the compensation increase assumption is generally set at a rate consistent with current and expected long-term compensation and salary policy, including inflation.
for pension costs, actuarial gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line amortization method over the average remaining service period of employees, which is approximately 9 years. for opeb costs, actuarial gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line amortization method over the average future lifetime, which is approximately 14 years. the qualified pension plan does not utilize the allowable corridor, while the nonqualified pension plan and opeb plans utilize the 10% corridor. prior service costs are amortized on a weighted average basis over approximately 8 years for pension costs and 8 years for opeb costs. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, employee and agent benefits" for further discussion.
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of the liability for taxes due. our tax accounting represents management's best estimate of various events and transactions, such as completion of tax audits or establishment of, or changes to, a valuation allowance associated with certain deferred tax assets, which could affect our estimates and effective income tax rate in a particular quarter or annual period. deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. we are required to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realizable. in determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider many factors, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in prior carryback years and implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies management would employ to realize the tax benefit.
u.s. federal and state deferred income taxes have not been provided on approximately $1,001.5 million of accumulated but undistributed earnings from operations of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2019. we do not record u.s. federal and state deferred income taxes on foreign earnings not expected to be distributed to the u.s.
we apply an exception to the general rule, which under u.s. gaap otherwise requires the recording of u.s. deferred income taxes on the anticipated repatriation of foreign earnings as recognized for financial reporting purposes.
the exception permits us to not record a u.s. deferred income tax liability on foreign earnings we expect to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations. the related deferred income taxes will be recorded in the period it becomes apparent we can no longer positively assert some or all the undistributed earnings will remain invested into the foreseeable future.
inherent in the provision for income taxes are estimates and our expectations regarding the deductibility of certain items, the timing of income and expense recognition, future performance and the current or future realization of operating losses, capital losses and certain tax credits. we regularly evaluate the capital needs of our domestic and foreign operations considering all available information, including operating and capital plans, regulatory capital requirements, parent company financing and cash flow needs, as well as tax laws applicable to our domestic and foreign subsidiaries. in the event these estimates differ from our prior estimates due to the receipt of new information, we may be required to significantly change the provision for income taxes recorded in the consolidated financial statements. any such change could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these estimates change. a significant decline in value of financial assets could lead to establishment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets having an adverse effect on current and future results. in management's judgment, total deferred income tax assets are more-likely-than-not to be realized.
in addition, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits in the u.s. as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. tax benefits are recognized for book purposes when the more-likely-than-not threshold is met with regard to the validity of an uncertain tax position. once this threshold is met, for each uncertain tax position we recognize in earnings the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the internal revenue service or other income taxing authorities for audits ongoing or not yet commenced.
we had $195.3 million of current income tax receivables associated with outstanding audit issues reported as other assets in our consolidated statements of financial position as of december 31, 2019. we believe there are adequate defenses against, or sufficient provisions for, the contested issues, but final resolution of contested issues could take several years while legal remedies are pursued. consequently, we do not anticipate the ultimate resolution of audits ongoing or not yet commenced to have a material impact on our net income.
the effects of tax legislation are recognized in the period of enactment. the effects of the u.s. tax reform were reflected in the 2017 financial statements as determined or as reasonably estimated provisional amounts based on available information subject to interpretation in accordance with the sec's staff accounting bulletin no. 118
("sab 118"). sab 118 provides guidance on accounting

"financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 10, income taxes" for further discussion. transactions affecting comparability of results of operations acquisitions wells fargo irt business.on july 1, 2019, we closed on our agreement with wells fargo bank, n.a. to acquire its irt business, which includes defined contribution, defined benefit, executive deferred compensation, employee stock ownership plans, institutional trust and custody, and institutional asset advisory businesses. the results of this acquisition are reflected in the retirement and income solutions segment. the purchase price consisted of (i) $1.2 billion cash paid at closing and (ii) an additional earn-out payment of up to $150.0 million based upon the retention of fee revenue of the acquired business through december 31, 2020. the transaction was funded with available cash and debt financing. for additional information regarding the debt issuance, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 9, debt." robustwealth.on july 2, 2018, we finalized the acquisition of robustwealth, a financial technology company. the acquisition adds robustwealth's digital capabilities to our industry knowledge, asset management experience and technology to help consumers meet their financial goals on an enhanced digital advice platform. the robustwealth platform will retain its open architecture philosophy, and robustwealth will continue to sell its platform to outside firms as part of its growth strategy. robustwealth is consolidated within the corporate segment due to its strategic benefits across the organization with the majority of goodwill allocated to the principal global investors segment. internos.on april 16, 2018, we finalized the acquisition of internos, a london-based european real estate investment manager. upon acquisition, internos became principal real estate europe limited and operates as our dedicated european real estate private equity focused investment team, expanding our global real estate capabilities. at the time of closing, the acquisition increased our aum by $3.5 billion.
principal real estate europe limited is reported within the principal global investors segment. metlife afore, s.a.

real estate realignment.effective august 1, 2018, we agreed to a realignment of one of our real estate investment teams. with the realignment, we no longer manage $9.2 billion of assets for a large real estate client but accelerated the recognition of a significant performance fee that was earned due to our successful management of the assets, which drove market value appreciation of the real estate investments. during the third quarter of 2018
we recognized, within the principal global investors segment, $253.1 million of fees and other revenue related to the performance fee. this was partially offset by $151.9 million of operating expenses related to revenue sharing arrangements, resulting in a $101.2 million increase to pre-tax operating earnings within the principal global investors segment. ongoing impacts to segment pre-tax operating earnings are not expected to be material. cimb joint ventures.on may 25, 2018, we and cimb completed new ownership agreements in our joint ventures, pam and piam.
with the completion we increased our ownership stake to 60% with cimb retaining 40% ownership and co-management of both pam and piam. our investment in both entities will continue to be reported using the equity method within the principal international segment. tax cuts and jobs act.the u.s. tax reform enacted on december 22, 2017, made broad and complex changes to the u.s. internal revenue code applicable to us. the u.s. statutory tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. other provisions of the u.s. tax reform effective january 1, 2018, include, but are not limited to: 1) provisions reducing the dividends received deduction; 2) essentially eliminating u.s. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; 3) retaining an element of current inclusion of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations; 4) eliminating the corporate amt and 5) changing how existing amt credits will be realized. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 10, income taxes" for further details. real estate transactions.in an effort to adjust the concentration of our real estate holdings in southern california, improve the liquidity of our real estate portfolio and gain control of certain properties that were jointly owned, we entered an exchange agreement to exit certain real estate joint ventures in september 2017. the transaction resulted in us transferring our interest in certain real estate properties in exchange for our joint venture partner's interest in certain other real estate properties. in a subsequent transaction we sold certain of these real estate properties to a third party. both transactions closed in september 2017. we recognized a $690.9 million net pre-tax realized capital gain ($410.8 million net after-tax realized capital gain) for the year ended december 31, 2017, as a result of these transactions. for additional information related to these transactions, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, investments" under the caption, "real estate transactions." other factors affecting comparability fluctuations in foreign currency to u.s. dollar exchange rates fluctuations in foreign currency to u.s. dollar exchange rates for locations in which we have operations can affect reported financial results. in years when foreign currencies weaken against the u.s. dollar, translating foreign currencies into u.s. dollars results in fewer u.s. dollars to be reported. when foreign currencies strengthen, translating foreign currencies into u.s. dollars results in more u.s. dollars to be reported.

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations create variances in our financial statement line items. the most significant impact occurs within our principal international segment where pre-tax operating earnings were negatively impacted $24.2 million and $11.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency to u.s. dollar exchange rates. this impact was calculated by comparing (a) the difference between current year results and prior year results to (b) the difference between current year results and prior year results translated using current year exchange rates for both periods. we use this approach to calculate the impact of exchange rates on all revenue and expense line items. for a discussion of our approaches to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk, see item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency risk." effects of inflation the impact of inflation has not had a material effect on our annual consolidated results of operations over the past three years. however, we may be materially affected by inflation in the future. variable investment income variable investment income includes certain types of investment returns such as prepayment fees and income (loss) from certain elements of our other alternative asset classes, including results of value-add real estate sales activity. due to its unpredictable nature, variable investment income may or may not be material to our financial results for a given reporting period and may create variances when comparing different reporting periods. for additional information, see "investment results." recent accounting changes for recent accounting changes, see item 8.

retirement and income solutions segment retirement and income solutions trends several key factors impact revenue and earnings growth in the retirement and income solutions segment. these factors include: the ability of our distribution channels to generate new sales and retain existing business;
pricing decisions that take account of competitive conditions, persistency, investment returns, mortality trends, and operating expense levels; investment management performance; equity market returns and interest rate changes.
profitability ultimately depends on our ability to price products and invest assets at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring and administering those products.

principal international segment principal international trends our principal international businesses focus on locations with growing middle classes, favorable demographics and increasing long-term savings, ideally with voluntary or mandatory pension markets. with variations depending upon the specific location, we have targeted these markets for sales of retirement and related products and services, including mutual funds, asset management, income annuities and life insurance accumulation products to businesses and individuals. we have pursued our international strategy through a combination of acquisitions, start-up operations and joint ventures, which require infusions of capital consistent with our strategy of long-term growth and profitability. principal international segment summary financial data aum is generally a key indicator of earnings growth for the segment, as aum is the base by which we can generate local currency profits. the cuprum business in chile differs in that the majority of fees are collected with each deposit by the mandatory retirement customers, based on a capped salary level, as opposed to asset levels. net customer cash flow and market performance are the two main drivers of local currency aum growth. net customer cash flow reflects our ability to attract and retain client deposits. market performance reflects the investment returns on our underlying aum. our financial results are also impacted by fluctuations of the foreign currency to u.s. dollar exchange rates for the locations in which we have business. aum of our foreign subsidiaries is translated into u.s. dollar equivalents at the end of the reporting period using the spot foreign exchange rates. revenue and expenses for our foreign subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollar equivalents at the average foreign exchange rates for the reporting period. the following table presents the principal international segment aum rollforward for the years indicated:

2018. liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources represent the overall strength of a company and its ability to generate strong cash flows, borrow funds at a competitive rate and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs. our legal entity structure has an impact on our ability to meet cash flow needs as an organization. following is a simplified organizational structure. liquidity our liquidity requirements have been and will continue to be met by funds from consolidated operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper, common stock, debt or other capital securities and borrowings from credit facilities. we believe the cash flows from these sources are sufficient to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of our operations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies. we maintain a level of cash and securities which, combined with expected cash inflows from investments and operations, we believe to be adequate to meet anticipated short-term and long-term payment obligations. we will continue our prudent capital management practice of regularly exploring options available to us to maximize capital flexibility, including accessing the capital markets and careful attention to and management of expenses. we perform rigorous liquidity stress testing to ensure our asset portfolio includes sufficient high quality liquid assets that could be utilized to bolster our liquidity position under increasingly stressed market conditions. these assets could be utilized as collateral for secured borrowing transactions with various third parties or by selling the securities in the open market if needed. we also manage liquidity risk by limiting the sales of liabilities with features such as puts or other options that can be exercised at inopportune times. for example, as of december 31, 2019, approximately $9.9 billion, or 99%, of our institutional guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements cannot be redeemed by contractholders prior to maturity. our individual annuity liabilities also contain surrender charges and other provisions limiting early surrenders. the following table summarizes the withdrawal characteristics of our domestic general account investment contracts as of december

table of contents universal life insurance and certain traditional life insurance policies are also subject to discretionary withdrawals by policyholders. however, life insurance policies tend to be less susceptible to withdrawal than our investment contracts because policyholders may be subject to a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new life insurance policy. in addition, our life insurance liabilities include surrender charges to discourage early surrenders. we had the following short-term credit facilities with various financial institutions as of december

the revolving credit facilities are committed and available for general corporate purposes. these credit facilities also provide 100% back-stop support for our commercial paper program, of which we had no outstanding balances as of december 31, 2019 and 2018.most of the banks supporting the credit facilities have other relationships with us. due to the financial strength and the strong relationships we have with these providers, we are comfortable we have very low risk the financial institutions would be unable or unwilling to fund these facilities. the holding companies: principal financial group, inc. and principal financial services, inc.the principal sources of funds available to our parent holding company, pfg, are dividends from subsidiaries as well as its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise capital to meet operating and growth needs. these funds are used by pfg to meet its obligations, which include the payment of dividends on common stock, debt service and the repurchase of stock. the declaration and payment of common stock dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our overall financial condition, results of operations, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects, receipt of dividends from principal life (as described below), risk management considerations and other factors deemed relevant by the board. no significant restrictions limit the payment of dividends by pfg, except those generally applicable to corporations incorporated in delaware. dividends from principal life, our primary subsidiary, are limited by iowa law. under iowa law, principal life may pay dividends only from the earned surplus arising from its business and must receive the prior approval of the commissioner of insurance of the state of iowa (the "commissioner") to pay stockholder dividends or make any other distribution if such distribution would exceed certain statutory limitations. iowa law gives the commissioner discretion to disapprove requests for distributions in excess of these limitations. extraordinary dividends include those made, together with dividends and other distributions, within the preceding twelve months that exceed the greater of (i) 10% of statutory policyholder surplus as of the previous year-end or (ii) the statutory net gain from operations from the previous calendar year, not to exceed earned surplus. based on statutory results for the year ended december 31, 2019, the ordinary stockholder dividend limitation for principal life is approximately $1,060.3 million in 2020. total stockholder dividends paid by principal life to its parent in 2019 were $1,145.0 million, $975.0 million of which was extraordinary and approved by the commissioner. as of december 31, 2019, we had $1,750.0 million of cash and liquid assets held in our holding companies and other subsidiaries, which is available for corporate purposes. this includes assets in excess of targeted statutory capital ratios and immediate working capital needs. corporate balances held in foreign holding companies meet the indefinite reinvestment exception (see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 10, income taxes"). we recorded a one-time deemed repatriation tax on certain accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the u.s. tax reform;
however, we have not had a change in the indefinite reinvestment assertion as we still have plans in place to use cash offshore. in 2018, total stockholder dividends paid by principal life to its parent were $840.0 million, all of which was extraordinary and approved by the commissioner.

table of contents on may 1, 2017, principal life sold its ownership interest in principal global investors, llc to principal life's direct parent, pfs, in connection with a corporate reorganization designed to better utilize and allocate capital internally. subsequent to the sale, principal life paid an extraordinary dividend of $1,068.4 million to its parent, which was approved by the commissioner, primarily from proceeds received from the sale. in 2017, total stockholder dividends paid by principal life to its parent were $1,818.4 million, all of which was extraordinary and approved by the commissioner.
operations. our primary consolidated cash flow sources are premiums from insurance products, pension and annuity deposits, asset management fee revenues, administrative services fee revenues, income from investments and proceeds from the sales or maturity of investments. cash outflows consist primarily of payment of benefits to policyholders and beneficiaries, income and other taxes, current operating expenses, payment of dividends to policyholders, payments in connection with investments acquired, payments made to acquire subsidiaries, payments relating to policy and contract surrenders, withdrawals, policy loans, interest payments and repayment of short-term debt and long-term debt. our investment strategies are generally intended to provide adequate funds to pay benefits without forced sales of investments. for a discussion of our investment objectives and strategies, see "investments."
cash flows. all cash flow activity, as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, provides relevant information regarding our sources and uses of cash. the following discussion of our operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows excludes cash flows attributable to the separate accounts.
net cash provided by operating activities was $5,493.2 million, $5,156.5 million and $4,188.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. our insurance businesses typically generate positive cash flows from operating activities, as premiums collected from our insurance products and income received from our investments exceed acquisition costs, benefits paid, redemptions and operating expenses. these positive cash flows are then invested to support the obligations of our insurance and investment products and required capital supporting these products. our cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of premiums, fees and investment income received and benefits and expenses paid. the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to fluctuations in receivables and payables associated with the timing of settlements. the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to growth in the business and a decrease in net cash outflows for trading securities and equity securities with operating intent.
net cash used in investing activities was $7,688.5 million, $5,702.5 million and $4,052.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2019
compared to 2018 was primarily due to $1,209.6 million of cash paid for the acquired business. additionally, cash used in investing activities increased as a result of portfolio mix variances, including net purchases of fixed maturities available-for-sale and equity securities with intent to hold. the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was driven by increased net purchases of fixed maturities available-for-sale and equity securities with intent to hold, an increase in mortgage loans acquired or originated and a decrease in cash provided from the sale of real estate.
net cash provided by financing activities was $1,733.7 million and $1,052.7 million for the years ended december
31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $384.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily the result of the $500.0 million senior note issuance in 2019, the proceeds of which were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of the acquired business. the increase in cash provided by financing activities in
2018 compared to 2017 was the result of higher net investment contract deposits in 2018 as compared to 2017.
shelf registration. on may 3, 2017, our shelf registration statement was filed with the sec and became effective.

contingent funding agreements for senior debt issuance.on march 8, 2018, we entered into two contingent funding agreements that give us the right at any time over a ten-year or thirty-year period to issue up to $400.0 million or $350.0 million, respectively, of senior notes. for more information on the contingent funding agreements, see item 8.

obligations contractual obligations exclude short-term liabilities, other policyholder funds, taxes and short-term debt as these are not long-term and/or not contractual in nature. contractual obligations also exclude obligations under our pension and opeb plans as we do not anticipate contributions will be needed to satisfy the minimum funding requirements of erisa for our qualified pension plan, nor do we anticipate contributions to the opeb plans due to the funded status of the trust. in addition, separate account
(1)  liabilities are excluded. separate account liabilities represent the fair market value of the assets of the funds that are separately administered by us. generally, the separate account contract owner, rather than us, bears the investment risk of these funds. the separate account liabilities are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of any other business of ours. net deposits, net investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on the separate accounts are not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. the separate account obligations will be fully funded by cash flows from the separate account assets.

pension and opeb plan funding we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our u.s.

table of contents we report the net funded status of our pension and opeb plans in the consolidated statements of financial position.
the net funded status represents the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation for pension and opeb plans. the measurement of the net funded status can vary based upon the fluctuations in the fair value of the plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for the plans as discussed below. the net underfunded status of the pension and opeb obligation was $134.7 million pre-tax and $196.0 million pre-tax as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. nonqualified pension plan assets are not included as part of the funding status mentioned above. the nonqualified pension plan assets are held in rabbi trusts for the benefit of all nonqualified plan participants. the assets held in a rabbi trust are available to satisfy the claims of general creditors only in the event of bankruptcy. therefore, these assets are fully consolidated in our consolidated statements of financial position and are not reflected in our funded status as they do not qualify as plan assets under u.s. gaap. the market value of assets held in these trusts was $377.8 million and $348.8 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
our funding policy for the qualified pension plan is to fund the plan annually in an amount at least equal to the minimum annual contributions required under erisa and, generally, not greater than the maximum amount that can be deducted for u.s. federal income tax purposes. we do not anticipate contributions will be needed in 2020 to satisfy the minimum funding requirements of erisa for our qualified pension plan. we are unable to estimate the amount that may be contributed, but it is possible that we may fund the plans in 2020 up to $35.0 million. this includes funding for both our qualified and nonqualified pension plans. we may contribute to our opeb plans in 2020 pending further analysis.
contractual commitments we have made commitments to fund certain limited partnerships and other funds in which we are not the general partner or investment manager. as of december 31, 2019, the amount of unfunded commitments was $518.2 million. we are only required to fund additional equity under these commitments when called upon to do so by the partnership or fund; therefore, these commitments are not liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position.
off-balance sheet arrangements variable interest entities. we have relationships with various types of special purpose entities and other entities where we have a variable interest as described in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 3, variable interest entities." we have made commitments to fund certain limited partnerships, as previously discussed in "contractual commitments", some of which are classified as unconsolidated variable interest entities.
guarantees and indemnifications. as of december 31, 2019, no significant changes to guarantees and indemnifications have occurred since december 31, 2018. for guarantee and indemnification information, see item 8.

financial strength and credit ratings our ratings are influenced by the relative ratings of our peers/competitors as well as many other factors including our operating and financial performance, capital levels, asset quality, liquidity, asset/liability management, overall portfolio mix, financial leverage (i.e., debt), risk exposures and operating leverage.
in february 2020, a.m. best affirmed the financial strength ratings of principal life and pnlic at 'a+'. the outlook remains 'stable' for all financial strength ratings. the affirmation reflects the strength of our balance sheets as well as our strong operating performance, favorable business profile and very strong enterprise risk management. concurrently, a.m. best upgraded the long-term issuer credit ratings. the outlook for the long-term issuer credit rating was revised to 'stable' from 'positive'. the ratings upgrade reflects the continued strengthening and evolution of our enterprise risk management capabilities.
in the fourth quarter of 2019, fitch revised its 2020 outlook on the u.s. life insurance sector to 'negative' from
'stable' which reflects concerns over the low interest rate environment. a.m. best, s&p and moody's continue to maintain a 'stable' industry outlook.
in august 2019, s&p affirmed the financial strength ratings of principal life and pnlic at 'a+'. s&p also affirmed pfg's senior unsecured debt rating at 'a-'. the outlook remains 'stable' for all ratings. the rating affirmation reflects s&p's view that we have a very strong competitive position as a leader in the u.s. small to midsize 401(k)

impacts of income taxes for income tax information, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 10, income taxes." fair value measurement fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority (level 1) to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and gives the lowest priority (level 3) to unobservable inputs. the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety considering factors specific to the asset or liability. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 14, fair value measurements"
for further details, including a reconciliation of changes in level 3 fair value measurements. as of december 31,
2019, 41% of our net assets (liabilities) were level 1, 55% were level 2 and 4% were level 3. excluding separate account assets as of december 31, 2019, 3% of our net assets (liabilities) were level 1, 97% were level 2 and 0%
were level 3. as of december 31, 2018, 39% of our net assets (liabilities) were level 1, 57% were level 2 and 4%
were level 3. excluding separate account assets as of december 31, 2018, 3% of our net assets (liabilities) were level 1, 97% were level 2 and 0% were level 3.

table of contents changes in level 3 fair value measurements net assets (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (level 3) as of december 31, 2019, were $9,191.0 million as compared to
$8,729.4 million as of december 31, 2018. the increase was primarily related to gains in our separate account assets and net purchases of certain structured securities. these increases were partially offset by net sales and transfers out of level 3 and into level 2 of our separate account assets and losses in investment contracts. the separate account assets transferred out of level 3 during 2019 primarily included those we now value using the unit trust approved pooled investment fund ("apif") as the unit of account that were previously valued using the underlying investments of the unit trust apif. net assets (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (level 3) as of december 31, 2018, were $8,729.4 million as compared to
$7,791.7 million as of december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily related to gains and net purchases in our separate account assets and net purchases of certain structured securities. these increases were partially offset by net transfers out of level 3 into level 2 for certain fixed maturities, available-for-sale. the transfers out of level 3 were due to our obtaining prices from recognized third party pricing vendors or from internal models using substantially all market observable information versus relying on broker quotes or utilizing significant unobservable inputs. investments we had total consolidated assets as of december 31, 2019, of $276,087.8 million, of which $96,351.4 million were invested assets. the rest of our total consolidated assets are comprised primarily of separate account assets for which we do not bear investment risk; therefore, the discussion and financial information below does not include such assets. overall composition of invested assets invested assets as of december 31, 2019, were predominantly high quality and broadly diversified across asset class, individual credit, industry and geographic location. asset allocation is determined based on cash flow and the risk/return requirements of our products. as shown in the following table, the major categories of invested assets are fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans.

year ended december 31, 2019 compared to year ended december 31, 2018 fixed maturities, available-for-sale and trading - noncredit had net gains in 2019 as compared to net losses in 2018 primarily due to gains versus losses on trading securities related to changes in interest rates and credit spreads and available-for-sale noncredit losses during 2018 related to portfolio rebalancing. net realized losses on derivatives and related hedge activities increased due to losses in 2019 versus gains in 2018 on the gmwb embedded derivatives, including changes in the spread reflecting our own creditworthiness, and related hedging instruments. these changes were partially offset by increased gains on interest rate swaps not designated as hedging instruments due to changes in interest rates.
additionally, our principal international segment had a decrease in losses on currency derivatives and embedded derivatives due to changes in exchange rates and interest rates, respectively. other gains increased primarily due to increases from equity securities and sponsored invested funds related primarily to mark-to-market changes and a loss on the sale of a closed block of annuity business within our principal international operating segment in
2018. these increases were partially offset by a gain from the sale of an equity method investment during 2018 and an impairment of an equity method investment in 2019. year ended december 31, 2018 compared to year ended december
31, 2017 net realized capital losses on fixed maturities, available for sale - credit impairments decreased primarily due to lower impairments on corporate and structured fixed maturities. net realized capital losses on derivatives and related hedge activities decreased primarily due to gains in 2018 versus losses in 2017 on the gmwb embedded derivatives, including changes in the spread reflecting our own creditworthiness, and related hedging instruments and on interest rate swaps not designated as hedging instruments due to changes in interest rates.
these changes were partially offset by currency derivatives that had losses in 2018 versus gains in 2017 due to changes in exchange rates. other gains decreased primarily due to net gains resulting from real estate transactions in 2017.

table of contents u.s. investment operations of our invested assets, $88,563.3 million were held by our u.s. operations as of december 31, 2019. our u.s. invested assets are managed primarily by our principal global investors segment. our investment committee, appointed by our board of directors, is responsible for establishing investment policies and monitoring risk limits and tolerances. our primary investment objective is to maximize after-tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters. we seek to protect customers' benefits by optimizing the risk/return relationship on an ongoing basis, through asset/liability matching, reducing credit risk, avoiding high levels of investments that may be redeemed by the issuer, maintaining sufficiently liquid investments and avoiding undue asset concentrations through diversification. we are exposed to two primary sources of investment risk:
●  credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of an obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest and
●  interest rate risk, relating to the market price and/or cash flow variability associated with changes in market yield curves.
our ability to manage credit risk is essential to our business and our profitability. we devote considerable resources to the credit analysis of each new investment. we manage credit risk through industry, issuer and asset class diversification. a dedicated committee, comprised of senior investment professional staff members, approves the credit rating for the fixed maturities we purchase. we have teams of security analysts, organized by industry and asset class, that analyze and monitor these investments. investments held in the portfolio are monitored on a continuous basis with a formal review documented annually or more frequently if material events affect the issuer.
the analysis includes both fundamental and technical factors. the fundamental analysis encompasses both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the issuer. the qualitative analysis includes an assessment of both accounting and management aggressiveness of the issuer. in addition, technical indicators such as stock price volatility and credit default swap levels are monitored. we regularly review our investments to determine whether we should re-rate them, employing the following criteria:
●  material changes in the issuer's revenues, margins, capital structure or collateral values;
●  significant management or organizational changes;
●  significant changes regarding the issuer's industry;
●  debt service coverage or cash flow ratios that fall below industry-specific thresholds;
●  violation of financial covenants and
●  other business factors that relate to the issuer.
we purchase credit default swaps to hedge certain credit exposures in our investment portfolio. we economically hedged credit exposure in our portfolio by purchasing credit default swaps with a notional amount of $75.0 million and $95.0 million as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, respectively. we sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to investors when entering into synthetic replicating transactions. when selling credit protection, if there is an event of default by the referenced name, we are obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the referenced security. for further information on credit derivatives sold, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 5, derivative financial instruments" under the caption, "credit derivatives sold." our use of derivatives exposes us to counterparty risk, or the risk that the counterparty fails to perform the terms of the derivative contract. we actively manage this risk by:
●  obtaining approval of all new counterparties by the investment committee;
●  establishing exposure limits that take into account non-derivative exposure we have with the counterparty as well as derivative exposure;
●  performing similar credit analysis prior to approval on each derivatives counterparty that we do when lending money on a long-term basis;
●  diversifying our risk across numerous approved counterparties;

table of contents implementing credit support annex (collateral) agreements ("csas") for over-the-counter derivative
●  transactions or similar agreements with a majority of our counterparties to further limit counterparty exposures, which provide for netting of exposures;
●  limiting exposure to a credit or better for over-the-counter derivative counterparties without csas;
●  conducting stress-test analysis to determine the maximum exposure created during the life of a prospective transaction;
●  daily monitoring of counterparty credit ratings, exposures and associated collateral levels and
●  trading mandatorily cleared contracts through centralized clearinghouses.
we manage our exposure on a net basis, whereby we net positive and negative exposures for each counterparty with agreements in place. for further information on derivative exposure, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, investments" under the caption, "balance sheet offsetting." a dedicated risk management team is responsible for centralized monitoring of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio. we apply a variety of strategies to minimize credit risk in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. when considering new commercial mortgage loans, we review the cash flow fundamentals of the property, make a physical assessment of the underlying commercial real estate, conduct a comprehensive market analysis and compare against industry lending practices. we use a proprietary risk rating model to evaluate all new and substantially all existing loans within the portfolio. the proprietary risk model is designed to stress projected cash flows under simulated economic and market downturns. our lending guidelines are typically 75% or less loan-to-
value ratio and a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2 times. we analyze investments outside of these guidelines based on cash flow quality, tenancy and other factors. the following table presents loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios for our brick and mortar commercial mortgage loans:

maturities we believe it is desirable to hold residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities due to their credit quality and liquidity as well as portfolio diversification characteristics. our portfolio is comprised of government national mortgage association, federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation pass-through securities. in addition, our residential collateralized mortgage obligation portfolio offers structural features that allow cash flows to be matched to our liabilities. we purchase cmbs to diversify the overall credit risks of the fixed maturities portfolio and to provide attractive returns. the primary risks in holding cmbs are structural and credit risks. structural risks include the security's priority in the issuer's capital structure, the adequacy of and ability to realize proceeds from the collateral and the potential for prepayments. credit risks involve collateral and issuer/servicer risk where collateral and servicer performance may deteriorate. cmbs are predominantly comprised of large pool securitizations that are diverse by property type, borrower and geographic dispersion. the risks to any cmbs deal are determined by the credit quality of the underlying loans and how those loans perform over time. another key risk is the vintage of the underlying loans and the state of the markets during a particular vintage. in the cmbs market, there is a material difference in the outlook for the performance of loans originated in 2004 and earlier relative to loans originated in 2005 through
2008. for loans originated prior to 2005, underwriting assumptions were more conservative regarding required debt service coverage and loan-to-value ratios. for the 2005 through 2008 vintages, real estate values peaked and the underwriting expectations were that values would continue to increase, which makes those loan values more sensitive to market declines. the 2009 and later vintages represent a return to debt service coverage ratios and loan-to-
value ratios that more closely resemble loans originated prior to 2005.

table of contents similar to cmbs, we purchase abs for diversification and to provide attractive returns. the primary risks in holding abs are also structural and credit risks, which are similar to those noted above for cmbs. our abs portfolio is diversified by type of asset, issuer, and vintage. we actively monitor holdings of abs to recognize adverse changes in the risk profile of each security. prepayments in the abs portfolio are, in general, insensitive to changes in interest rates or are insulated from such changes by call protection features. in the event we are subject to prepayment risk, we monitor the factors that impact the level of prepayment and prepayment speed for those abs. in addition, we hold a diverse class of securities, which limits our exposure to any one security. the international exposure held in our u.s. operation's fixed maturities portfolio was 18% of total fixed maturities as of december 31, 2019 and 20% as of december 31, 2018. it is comprised of corporate and foreign government fixed maturities. the following table presents the carrying amount of our international exposure for our u.s. operation's fixed maturities portfolio for the years indicated.

table of contents fixed maturities valuation and credit quality.valuation techniques for the fixed maturities portfolio vary by security type and the availability of market data. the use of different pricing techniques and their assumptions could produce different financial results. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 14, fair value measurements" for further details regarding our pricing methodology. once prices are determined, they are reviewed by pricing analysts for reasonableness based on asset class and observable market data. investment analysts who are familiar with specific securities review prices for reasonableness through direct interaction with external sources, review of recent trade activity or use of internal models. all fixed maturities placed on the "watch list" are periodically analyzed by investment analysts. these analysts periodically meet with the chief investment officer and the portfolio managers to determine reasonableness of the analysts' prices. the valuation of impaired bonds for which there is no quoted price is typically based on relative value analysis and the present value of the future cash flows expected to be received. although we believe these values reasonably reflect the fair value of those securities, the key assumptions about risk premiums, performance of underlying collateral (if any) and other market factors involve qualitative and unobservable inputs.
the securities valuation office ("svo") of the naic monitors the bond investments of insurers for regulatory capital and reporting purposes and, when required, assigns securities to one of six categories referred to as naic designations. although naic designations are not produced to aid the investment decision making process, naic designations may serve as a reasonable proxy for nationally recognized statistical rating organizations' ("nrsro")
credit ratings for certain bonds. for most corporate bonds, naic designations 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade by such rating organizations. bonds are considered investment grade when rated ''baa3''
or higher by moody's, or ''bbb-'' or higher by s&p. naic designations 3 through 6 include bonds generally referred to as below investment grade. bonds are considered below investment grade when rated ''ba1'' or lower by moody's, or ''bb+'' or lower by s&p. however, for loan-backed and structured securities, as defined by the naic, the naic designation is not always a reasonable indication of an nrsro rating as described below. for cmbs and non-agency rmbs, blackrock solutions undertakes the modeling of those naic designations. prior to december 31, 2018, other loan-backed and structured securities may have also been subject to an intrinsic price matrix as provided by the naic. this may result in a final designation being higher or lower than the nrsro credit rating. the following table presents our total fixed maturities by naic designation as of the years indicated as well as the percentage, based on fair value, that each designation comprises.

fixed maturities watch list.we monitor any decline in the credit quality of fixed maturities through the designation of "problem securities," "potential problem securities" and "restructured securities". we define problem securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities: (i) with principal and/or interest payments in default or where default is perceived to be imminent in the near term, or (ii) issued by a company that went into bankruptcy subsequent to the acquisition of such securities. we define potential problem securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities included on an internal "watch list" for which management has concerns as to the ability of the issuer to comply with the present debt payment terms and which may result in the security becoming a problem or being restructured. the decision whether to classify a performing fixed maturity security as a potential problem involves significant subjective judgments by our management as to the likely future industry conditions and developments with respect to the issuer. we define restructured securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities where a concession has been granted to the borrower related to the borrower's financial difficulties that would not have otherwise been considered. we determine that restructures should occur in those instances where greater economic value will be realized under the new terms than through liquidation or other disposition and may involve a change in contractual cash flows. if the present value of the restructured cash flows is less than the current cost of the asset being restructured, a realized capital loss is recorded in net income and a new cost basis is established. the following table presents the total carrying amount of our fixed maturities portfolio, as well as its problem, potential problem and restructured fixed maturities for the years indicated.

table of contents fixed maturities impairments.we have a process in place to identify securities that could potentially have a credit impairment that is other than temporary. this process involves monitoring market events that could impact issuers' credit ratings, business climate, management changes, litigation and government actions and other similar factors. this process also involves monitoring late payments, pricing levels, downgrades by rating agencies, key financial ratios, financial statements, revenue forecasts and cash flow projections as indicators of credit issues.each reporting period, a group of individuals including the chief investment officer, our portfolio managers, the assigned analysts and representatives from investment accounting review all securities to determine whether an other-than-temporary decline in value exists and whether losses should be recognized. the analysis focuses on each issuer's ability to service its debts in a timely fashion. formal documentation of the analysis and our decision is prepared and approved by management.we consider relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether a credit or interest rate related impairment of a security is other than temporary. relevant facts and circumstances considered include: (1) the extent and length of time the fair value has been below cost; (2) the reasons for the decline in value; (3) the financial position and access to capital of the issuer, including the current and future impact of any specific events; (4) for structured securities, the adequacy of the expected cash flows; and (5) our intent to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost which, in some cases, may extend to maturity. to the extent we determine a security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired, an impairment loss is recognized. for additional details, see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, investments."we would not consider a security with unrealized losses to be other than temporarily impaired when it is not our intent to sell the security, it is not more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost, which may be at maturity, and we expect to recover the amortized cost basis.
however, we do sell securities under certain circumstances, such as when we have evidence of a change in the issuer's creditworthiness, when we anticipate poor relative future performance of securities, when a change in regulatory requirements modifies what constitutes a permissible investment or the maximum level of investments held or when there is an increase in capital requirements or a change in risk weights of debt securities. sales generate both gains and losses.a number of significant risks and uncertainties are inherent in the process of monitoring credit impairments and determining if an impairment is other than temporary. these risks and uncertainties include: (1) the risk that our assessment of an issuer's ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that issuer; (2) the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated; (3) the risk that our investment professionals are making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers and (4) the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and circumstances lead us to change our intent to not sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost. any of these situations could result in a charge to net income in a future period.the net realized loss relating to other-than-temporary credit impairments and credit related sales of fixed maturities was $43.5 million, $29.1 million, and $79.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

of the $104.2 million in gross unrealized losses as of december 31, 2019, $0.9 million in losses were attributed to securities scheduled to mature in one year or less, $5.7 million attributed to securities scheduled to mature between one to five years, $4.9 million attributed to securities scheduled to mature between five to ten years,
$35.9 million attributed to securities scheduled to mature after ten years and $56.8 million related to mortgage-
backed and other abs that are not classified by maturity year. as of december 31, 2019, we were in a $4,192.9
million net unrealized gain position as compared to a $17.3 million net unrealized gain position as of december 31,
2018. the $4,175.6 million increase in net unrealized gains for the year ended december 31, 2019, can be attributed to an approximate 74 basis points decrease in interest rates and tightening of credit spreads. fixed maturities available-for-sale unrealized losses.we believe our long-term fixed maturities portfolio is well diversified among industry types and between publicly traded and privately placed securities. each year, we direct the majority of our net cash inflows into investment grade fixed maturities. our current policy is to limit the percentage of fixed maturities invested in below investment grade assets to 15%.

table of contents we invest in privately placed fixed maturities to enhance the overall value of the portfolio, increase diversification and obtain higher yields than are possible with comparable quality public market securities.
generally, private placements provide broader access to management information, strengthened negotiated protective covenants, call protection features and, where applicable, a higher level of collateral. they are, however, generally not freely tradable because of restrictions imposed by u.s. federal and state securities laws and illiquid trading markets. the following table presents our fixed maturities available-for-sale by investment grade and below investment grade and the associated gross unrealized gains and losses, including the other-than-temporary impairment losses reported in aoci, as of the years indicated.

table of contents mortgage loans mortgage loans consist of commercial mortgage loans on real estate and residential mortgage loans.
the carrying amount of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio was $14,693.2 million and $13,721.2 million as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, respectively. the carrying amount of our residential mortgage loan portfolio was $1,086.4 million and $905.8 million as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, respectively.
commercial mortgage loans.we generally report commercial mortgage loans on real estate at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method and net of valuation allowances. commercial mortgage loans play an important role in our investment strategy by:
●  providing strong risk-adjusted relative value in comparison to other investment alternatives;
●  enhancing total returns and
●  providing strategic portfolio diversification.
as a result, we have focused on constructing a high quality portfolio of mortgages. our portfolio is generally comprised of mortgages originated with conservative loan-to-value ratios, high debt service coverages and general purpose property types with a strong credit tenancy. our commercial mortgage loan portfolio consists primarily of non-recourse, fixed rate mortgages on fully or near fully leased properties. the mortgage portfolio is comprised primarily of office properties, apartments, well anchored retail properties and general - purpose industrial properties. our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is diversified by geography and specific collateral property type. commercial mortgage lending in the state of california accounted for 21% of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio before valuation allowance as of both december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018. we are, therefore, exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, that may affect the region. like other lenders, we generally do not require earthquake insurance for properties on which we make commercial mortgage loans. with respect to california properties, however, we obtain an engineering report specific to each property.
the report assesses the building's design specifications, whether it has been upgraded to meet seismic building codes and the maximum loss that is likely to result from a variety of different seismic events. we also obtain a report that assesses, by building and geographic fault lines, the amount of loss our commercial mortgage loan portfolio might suffer under a variety of seismic events. the typical borrower in our commercial loan portfolio is a single purpose entity or single asset entity. as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, the total number of commercial mortgage loans outstanding was 767 and 795, of which 46% and 48% were for loans with principal balances less than $10.0 million, respectively. the average loan size of our commercial mortgage portfolio was $19.2 million and $17.3 million as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, respectively. commercial mortgage loan credit monitoring.for further details on monitoring and management of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio, see item 8.
"financial statements and supplementary data, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, investments"
under the caption, "mortgage loan credit monitoring." we categorize loans that are 60 days or more delinquent, loans in process of foreclosure and loans with borrowers or credit tenants in bankruptcy that are delinquent as
"problem" loans. valuation allowances or charge-offs have been recognized on most problem loans. we categorize loans that are delinquent less than 60 days where the default is expected to be cured and loans with borrowers or credit tenants in bankruptcy that are current as "potential problem" loans. the decision whether to classify a loan delinquent less than 60 days as a potential problem involves significant subjective judgments by management as to the likely future economic conditions and developments with respect to the borrower. we categorize loans for which the original note rate has been reduced below market and loans for which the principal has been reduced as
"restructured" loans. we also consider loans that are refinanced more than one year beyond the original maturity or call date at below market rates as restructured.

value before reserves residential mortgage loans.the residential mortgage loan portfolio is composed of first lien mortgages with an amortized cost of $1,077.2 million and $893.3 million and home equity mortgages with an amortized cost of $11.0
million and $15.1 million as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, respectively. the home equity loans are generally second lien mortgages made up of closed-end loans and lines of credit. non-performing residential mortgage loans, which are defined as loans 90 days or greater delinquent plus non-accrual loans, totaled $5.5
million and $7.2 million as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, respectively. we establish the residential mortgage loan valuation allowance at levels considered adequate to absorb estimated probable losses within the portfolio based on management's evaluation of the size and current risk characteristics of the portfolio. such evaluation considers numerous factors, including, but not limited to net charge-off trends, loss forecasts, collateral values, geographic location, borrower credit scores, delinquency rates, industry condition and economic trends. the changes in the valuation allowance are reported in net realized capital gains (losses) on our consolidated statements of operations. the following table represents our residential mortgage loan valuation allowance for the years indicated.

value before reserves real estate real estate consists primarily of commercial equity real estate. as of december 31, 2019 and december
31, 2018, the carrying amount of our equity real estate investment was $1,713.5 million and $1,726.3 million, respectively. our commercial equity real estate is held in the form of wholly owned real estate, real estate acquired upon foreclosure of commercial mortgage loans and majority owned interests in real estate joint ventures.

table of contents equity real estate is categorized as either "real estate held for investment" or "real estate held for sale." real estate held for investment totaled $1,544.5 million and $1,518.6 million as of december 31, 2019 and december 31,
2018, respectively. the carrying value of real estate held for investment is generally adjusted for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. such impairment adjustments are recorded as net realized capital losses in our consolidated results of operations.
impairment adjustments recorded for the year ended december 31, 2019, were $0.6 million. no such impairment adjustments were recorded for the year ended december 31, 2018. the carrying amount of real estate held for sale was $169.0 million and $207.7 million as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, respectively. once we identify a real estate property to be sold and it is probable that it will be sold, we classify the property as held for sale. we establish a valuation allowance subject to periodic revisions, if necessary, to adjust the carrying value of the property to reflect the lower of its current carrying value or the fair value, less associated selling costs. the valuation allowance did not change for the year ended december 31, 2019 or for the year ended december
31, 2018. we use research, both internal and external, to recommend appropriate product and geographic allocations and changes to the equity real estate portfolio. we monitor product, geographic and industry diversification separately and together to determine the most appropriate mix. equity real estate is distributed across geographic regions of the country. as of december 31, 2019, our largest equity real estate portfolio concentration was in the pacific (45%) region of the united states. by property type, our largest concentrations were in apartments (32%), office (30%), and industrial (25%) as of december 31, 2019. other investments our other investments totaled
$2,841.7 million as of december 31, 2019, compared to $2,596.0 million as of december 31, 2018. other investments include interests in unconsolidated entities, which include real estate properties owned jointly with venture partners and operated by the partners; sponsored investment funds; the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance; derivative assets and other investments. international investment operations of our invested assets,
$7,788.1 million were held by our principal international segment as of december 31, 2019. the assets are primarily managed by the local principal international affiliate. due to the regulatory constraints in each location, each company maintains its own investment policies. as shown in the following table, the major category of international invested assets is fixed maturities. the following table excludes invested assets of the separate accounts.

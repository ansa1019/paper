item 1a. risk factors the following are important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forward-looking statements made in this annual report on form 10-k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time.
we may face slowing revenue growth which could negatively impact our profitability and stock price.
the revenue growth rate we have enjoyed in recent years may not continue in future periods and could decline. our revenue depends on continued growth in demand for our solutions and our ability to maintain the prices we charge for them. our traditional offerings, particularly our media and web performance solutions, are subject to increasing pricing pressure in certain verticals and geographies due to competition and business conditions affecting many of our customers. this has increased the difficulty of accelerating revenue growth. our ability to increase our revenue depends on many other factors including how well we can:
•   retain existing customers and sell new and additional products to them;
•   attract new customers;
•   develop and sell new solutions that are attractive to our current and potential customers and not easily replicable by competitors;
•   address potential commoditization of our delivery-based solutions, which can lead to lower prices and loss of customers to competitors;
•   counteract multi-vendor policies designed to reduce reliance on any particular provider, such as us;
•   adapt to changes in our customer contracting models from a committed revenue structure to a "pay-as-you-go" approach, which would make it easier for customers to stop doing business with us;
•   anticipate and react to changes in usage or adoption rates of the internet, e-commerce and electronic devices;
•   handle the impact of competition across our business;
•   cope with any inability of our customers, particularly commerce, travel and media companies, to continue their operations and spending levels; and
•   manage the impact of changes in general economic conditions, public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as the novel coronavirus), natural disasters and public unrest.
a slowing revenue growth rate could negatively impact our profitability and stock price.
if we are unable to continue to increase the amount of traffic we deliver over our network, it will be difficult to maintain or improve our current level of profitability without impacting our operations.
maintaining or improving our profitability depends both on our ability to increase our revenue, even with potential challenges discussed above, and limit our expenses. we base our decisions about expense levels and investments on estimates of our future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth; however, many of our expenses are fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without incurring fees to exit certain obligations early. in anticipation of higher traffic on our network, we have increased capital expenditures recently and expect to continue doing so in the near term future. as a result, increasing the amount of traffic we deliver is key to profitable revenue growth. numerous factors can impact traffic growth including:
•   the pace of introduction of ott video delivery initiatives by our customers;
•   the popularity of our customers' streaming offerings as compared to those offered by companies that do not use our solutions;
•   the pace at which our customers' enterprise applications move from behind the firewall to the cloud;
•   media and other customers utilizing their own data centers and implementing delivery approaches that limit or eliminate reliance on third party providers like us; and
•   general economic conditions and industry pressures.
if we are unable to increase revenue and limit expenses, our results of operations would suffer. if we are required to significantly reduce expenses to maintain or improve profitability, such actions may negatively affect our ability to invest in our business for innovation, systems improvement and other initiatives.
if we are unable to compete effectively, our business will be adversely affected.
we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing. our current and potential competitors vary by size, product offerings, and geographic region and range from start-ups that offer solutions competing with a discrete part of our business to large technology or telecommunications companies that offer, or may be planning to introduce, products and services that are broadly competitive with what we do. the primary competitive factors in our market are: differentiation of technology, global presence, quality of solutions, customer service, technical expertise, security, ease-of-use, breadth of services offered, price, and financial strength. our competitors include some of our current partners and customers.
many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, broader product portfolios, longer operating histories, greater brand recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do. as a result, some of these competitors may be able to:
•   develop superior products or services;
•   enter new markets more easily;
•   gain greater market acceptance for their products and services;
•   expand their offerings more efficiently and more rapidly;
•   bundle their products that are competitive with ours with other solutions they offer in a way that makes our offerings less appealing to current and potential customers;
•   more quickly adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements;
•   take advantage of acquisition, investment and other opportunities more readily;
•   offer lower prices than ours;
•   spend more money on the promotion, marketing, and sales of their products and services; and
•   spend more money on research and development, including offering higher salaries to talented professionals which may impact our ability to hire or retain engineering and other personnel.
smaller and more nimble competitors may be able to:
•   attract customers by offering less sophisticated versions of products and services than we provide at lower prices than those we charge;
•   develop new business models that are disruptive to us;
•   in some cases, use funds from recent initial public offerings or private financings to strengthen their business to enable them to better compete with us; and
•   respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies, changes in customer requirements, and market and industry developments, resulting in superior offerings.
ultimately, any type of increased competition could result in price and revenue reductions, loss of customers and loss of market share, each of which could materially impact our business, profitability, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
if current and potential large customers shift to hardware-based or other diy internal solutions, our business will be negatively impacted.
we are reliant on large media and other customers to direct significant amounts of traffic to our network for a significant part of our revenues. in the past, some of those customers have determined that it is better for them to employ a "do-it-yourself" or "diy" strategy by putting in place equipment, software, and other technology solutions for content and application delivery and security protection within their internal systems instead of using akamai solutions for some or all of their needs. essentially, this is another form of competition for us. as the amount of money a customer spends with us increases, the risk that they will seek alternative solutions such as diy or a multi-vendor policy likewise increases. if additional large customers shift to this model, traffic on our network and our contracted revenue commitments would decrease, which would negatively impact our business, profitability, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
if we do not continue to develop new solutions that are attractive to enterprises, our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.
innovation is important to our revenue growth and profitability. we must develop new solutions that customers want to purchase in a rapidly-changing technology environment where it can be difficult to anticipate the needs of potential customers and competitors are also developing new solutions. the process of developing new solutions is complex, lengthy, and uncertain; we must commit significant resources to developing new services or features without knowing whether our investments will result in solutions the market will accept, and we may choose to invest in business areas for which a viable market for our products does not ultimately develop. this could cause our expenses to grow more rapidly than our revenue. similarly, trying to innovate through acquisition can be costly and with uncertain prospects for success. if we choose to cut research and development expenses to increase our profitability, investment in innovation could suffer and limit our development of new products. failure to develop, on a cost-effective basis, innovative new or enhanced solutions that are attractive to customers and profitable to us could have a material detrimental effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we and the other companies that compete in this industry and these markets experience continually shifting business relationships, commercial focuses and business priorities, all of which occur in reaction to industry and market forces and the emergence of new opportunities. these shifts have led or could lead to our customers or partners becoming our competitors; network suppliers no longer seeking to work with us; and large technology companies that previously did not appear to show interest in the markets we seek to address entering into those markets as our competitors. with this constantly changing environment, we may face operational difficulties in adjusting to the changes or our core strategies could become obsolete. any of these developments could harm our business.
cybersecurity breaches and attacks on us, as well as steps we need to take to prevent them, could lead to significant costs and disruptions that harm our business, financial results and reputation.
the akamai intelligent edge network transmits and stores both our and our customers' information, data, and encryption keys; customer information and data may, in turn, include individual data of and about their individual end-users. maintaining the security of the information we hold and of our solutions, network and internal it systems, which include hundreds of thousands of servers, is a critical issue for us and our customers. internet-based attacks on our customers and our own network are frequent, rapidly evolving and take a variety of forms, including ddos attacks, infrastructure attacks, botnets, malicious file uploads, cross-site scripting, credential abuse, ransomware, bugs, viruses, worms and malicious software programs. malicious actors also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or suppliers to disclose sensitive information through illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics. in addition, unauthorized parties may attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our internal-use information systems. cyberthreats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them.
moreover, the complexities in managing the security profile of a distributed network with vast scale and geographic reach that evolves to incorporate new capabilities expose us to both known and unknown vulnerabilities. these vulnerabilities, resident in either software or configurations, may persist for extended periods of time. similar security risks exist with respect to acquired companies, our business partners and the third-party vendors that we rely on for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions. as a result, we are subject to risks that the activities of our business partners and third-party vendors may adversely affect our business even if an attack or breach does not directly target our systems.
to defend against security threats to our internal it systems and cloud-based services, we must continuously engineer more secure solutions, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks, and maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services. this is frequently costly, with a negative impact on near-term profitability. we may need to increase our spending in the future; these costs could reduce our operating margin.
breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide solutions to our customers and protect their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information, thereby harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, expose us to lawsuits, fines or other penalties under privacy laws and other regulations, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business. any of these occurrences could have a material detrimental effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
evolving privacy, content and other regulations could negatively impact our profitability and business operations.
laws and regulations that apply to the internet related to privacy, security requirements, data localization, and restrictions on social media or other content could pose risks to our revenues, intellectual property, and customer relationships as well as increase expenses or create other disadvantages to our business. interpretations of laws or regulations that would subject us to regulatory supervision or, in the alternative, require us to exit a line of business or a country, could lead to loss of significant revenues and have a negative impact on the quality of our solutions.
privacy laws are rapidly proliferating, changing and evolving globally. governments, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. new laws, such as the european union general data protection regulation, or gdpr, and the california consumer privacy act of 2018, or ccpa, and industry self-regulatory codes have been enacted and more laws are being considered that may affect how we use data generated from our network as well as our ability to reach current and prospective customers, understand how our solutions are being used and respond to customer requests allowed under the laws. any perception that our business practices, our data collection activities or how our solutions operate represent an invasion of privacy, whether or not consistent with current regulations and industry practices, may subject us to public criticism (or boycotts), class action lawsuits, reputational harm, or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to liability. compliance with gdpr and other laws may be administratively difficult and expensive.
engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with data localization, privacy, law enforcement access requirements, or other regulations could require us to take on substantial expense and the divert engineering resources from other projects. we might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the gdpr, the ccpa, or other data regulations, or if the changes we implement to comply with such laws and regulations make our offerings less attractive.
our ability to leverage the data generated by our global network of servers is important to the value of many of the solutions we offer, our operational efficiency and future product development opportunities. our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments. compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort.
although we take steps intended to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or end user data we store and manage. improper disclosure or misuse of personal data could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to end customers or end users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.
we face risks associated with global operations that could harm our business.
a significant portion of our revenue growth in recent quarters has been attributable to revenue gains outside the united states. our operations in foreign countries subject us to risks (in addition to the regulatory risks discussed above) that may increase our costs, make our operations less efficient and require significant management attention. these risks include:
•   uncertainty regarding liability for content or services;
•   loss of revenues if the u.s. or foreign governments impose limitations on doing business with significant current or potential customers;
•   adjusting to different employee/employer relationships and different regulations governing such relationships;
•   corporate and personal liability for alleged or actual violations of laws and regulations;
•   difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language and cultural differences;
•   theft of intellectual property in high-risk countries where we operate;
•   difficulties in transferring funds from, or converting currencies in, certain countries;
•   managing the costs and processes necessary to comply with export control, sanctions, anti-corruption, data protection and competition laws and regulations;
•   reliance on channel partners over which we have limited control or influence on a day-to-day basis; and
•   potentially adverse tax consequences.
to continue to grow our revenues generated outside the united states, we will likely need to increase our reliance on resellers, systems integrators, and other strategic partners and to leverage those relationships to expand our distribution channels. we have not always been successful at developing these relationships due to the complexity of our solutions, our historical reliance on an internal sales force, and other factors. our failure to maintain and increase the number and quality of relationships with channel partners, and any inability to successfully execute on the partnerships we initiate, could significantly impede our revenue growth prospects in the short and long term.
geo-political events such as the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union, commonly referred to as brexit, may increase the likelihood of certain of these risks materializing or heighten their impact on us in affected regions. in particular, it is possible that the level of economic activity in the united kingdom and the rest of europe will be adversely impacted and that we will face increased regulatory and legal complexities, including those related to tax, trade, security and employee relations as a result of brexit. such changes could be costly and potentially disruptive to our operations and business relationships in affected regions. trade disputes, unrest and other political activity, as well as public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as the novel coronavirus), safety issues, natural disasters or general economic or political factors that disrupt our customers' businesses or our own operations could negatively impact our revenue and ability to offer services in impacted countries.
we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the u.s. securities and exchange commission, or the commission, in june 2016 in connection with resolution of an investigation relating to sales practices in a country outside the u.s. in the event we violate the terms of this non-prosecution agreement, we could be subject to additional investigation or enforcement by the commission or the department of justice. although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the non-prosecution agreement and relevant laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws. any such violations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our solutions in one or more countries. they could also materially affect our brand or reputation, our global operations, any international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business overall, and our financial results.
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results in u.s. dollar terms.
revenue generated and expenses incurred by our international subsidiaries are often denominated in the currencies of the local countries. as a result, our consolidated u.s. dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as the financial results of our international subsidiaries are translated from local currencies into u.s. dollars. in addition, our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions in non-functional currencies. while we have implemented a foreign currency hedging program to mitigate transactional exposures, there is no guarantee that such program will be effective.
defects or disruptions in our products and it systems could require us to increase spending on upgrading systems, diminish demand for our solutions or subject us to substantial liability.
our solutions are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks that we do not control. from time to time, we have needed to correct errors and defects in the software that underlies our platform that have given rise to service incidents or otherwise impacted our operations. we have also experienced customer dissatisfaction with the quality of some of our media delivery and other services, which has led to loss of business and could lead to loss of customers in the future. while we have robust quality control processes in place, there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our operations. we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely manner, and we may have insufficient resources to efficiently address multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession. if we are unable to efficiently and cost-effectively fix errors or other problems that may be identified and improve the quality of our solutions or systems, or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services or systems, we could experience loss of revenue and market share, damage to our reputation, increased expenses, delayed payments and be exposed to legal actions by our customers.
our business relies on our data systems, traffic measurement systems, billing systems, ordering processes and other operational and financial reporting and control systems. all of these systems have become increasingly complex due to the diversification and complexity of our business, acquisitions of new businesses with different systems, and increased regulation over controls and procedures. as a result, these systems could generate errors that impact traffic measurement or invoicing, revenue recognition and financial forecasting. we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems, traffic measurement systems, billing systems, ordering processes and other operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. these upgrades and improvements may be difficult and costly. if we are unable to adapt our systems and organization in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner to accommodate changing circumstances, our business may be adversely affected.
acquisitions and other strategic transactions we complete could result in operating difficulties, dilution, diversion of management attention and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.
we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions and other types of strategic relationships that involve technology sharing or close cooperation with other companies. acquisitions and other complex transactions are accompanied by a number of risks, including the following:
•   difficulty integrating the technologies, operations and personnel of acquired businesses;
•   potential disruption of our ongoing business;
•   potential distraction of management;
•   diversion of business resources from core operations;
•   financial consequences including an increase in operating expenses and other dilutive effects on our earnings;
•   assumption of legal risks related to compliance with laws, including privacy and anti-corruption regulations;
•   failure to realize synergies or other expected benefits;
•   acquisition of it systems that expose us to cybersecurity risks;
•   increased accounting charges such as impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, amortization of intangible assets acquired and a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired; and
•   potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses.
any inability to integrate completed acquisitions or combinations in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. if we use a significant portion of our available cash to pay for acquisitions that are not successful, it could harm our balance sheet and limit our flexibility to pursue other opportunities without having enjoyed the intended benefits of the acquisition. as we complete acquisitions, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating acquired technologies into our offerings while maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. if we are not successful in completing acquisitions or other strategic transactions that we may pursue in the future, we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result. future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or result in dilutive issuances of securities.
our failure to effectively manage our operations as our business evolves could harm us.
our future operating results will depend on our ability to manage our operations. as a result of the diversification of our business, personnel growth, increased usage of alternative working arrangements, acquisitions and international expansion in recent years, many of our employees are now based outside of our cambridge, massachusetts headquarters; however, most key management decisions are made by a relatively small group of individuals based primarily at our headquarters. if we are unable to appropriately increase management depth, enhance succession planning and decentralize our decision-making at a pace commensurate with our actual or desired growth rates, we may not be able to achieve our financial or operational goals. it is also important to our continued success that we hire qualified personnel, properly train them and manage out poorly-performing personnel, all while maintaining our corporate culture and spirit of innovation. if we are not successful in these efforts, our growth and operations could be adversely affected.
our restructuring and reorganization activities may be disruptive to our operations and harm our business.
over the past several years, we have implemented internal restructurings and reorganizations designed to reduce the size and cost of our operations, improve operational efficiencies, enhance our ability to pursue market opportunities and accelerate our technology development initiatives. we may take similar steps in the future as we seek to realize operating synergies, optimize our operations to achieve our target operating model and profitability objectives, respond to market forces, or better reflect changes in the strategic direction of our business. disruptions in operations may occur as a result of taking these actions. taking these actions may also result in significant expense for us, including with respect to workforce reductions, as well as decreased productivity due to employee distraction and unanticipated employee turnover. substantial expense or business disruptions resulting from restructuring and reorganization activities could adversely affect our operating results.
if we are unable to retain our key employees and hire and retain qualified sales, technical, marketing and support personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.
our future success depends upon the services of our executive officers and other key technology, sales, marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships. there is significant competition for talented individuals in the regions in which our primary offices are located, which affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones. none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term, and members of our senior management have left akamai over the years for a variety of reasons. the loss of the services of any of our key employees or our inability to attract and retain new talent may be disruptive to our operations and overall business.
we may need to defend against patent or copyright infringement claims, which would cause us to incur substantial costs or limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.
as we expand our business and develop new technologies, products and services, we have become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims and related litigation. we have also agreed to indemnify our customers and channel and strategic partners if our solutions infringe or misappropriate specified intellectual property rights; as a result, we have been and could again become involved in litigation or claims brought against customers or channel or strategic partners if our solutions or technology are the subject of such allegations. any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, brought against us or pursuant to which we indemnify our customers or partners could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following:
•   cease selling, incorporating or using features, functionalities, products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;
•   pay substantial damages and incur significant litigation expenses;
•   obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; or
•   redesign products or services.
if we are forced to take any of these actions, our business may be seriously harmed.
our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.
we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. these legal protections afford only limited protection. we have previously brought lawsuits against entities that we believed were infringing our intellectual property rights but have not always prevailed. such lawsuits can be expensive and require a significant amount of attention from our management and technical personnel, and the outcomes are unpredictable. monitoring unauthorized use of our solutions is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take will prevent unauthorized use of our technology. furthermore, we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted, that any future patent will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us. if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use, the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced. although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents, we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. such licenses may also be non-exclusive, meaning our competition may also be able to access such technology.
we rely on certain "open-source" software the use of which could result in our having to distribute our proprietary software, including our source code, to third parties on unfavorable terms, which could materially affect our business.
certain of our offerings use software that is subject to open-source licenses. open-source code is software that is freely accessible, usable and modifiable; however, certain open-source code is governed by license agreements, the terms of which could require users of such software to make any derivative works of the software available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost. because we use open-source code, we may be required to take remedial action in order to protect our proprietary software. such action could include replacing certain source code used in our software, discontinuing certain of our products or taking other actions that could be expensive and divert resources away from our development efforts. in addition, the terms relating to disclosure of derivative works in many open-source licenses are unclear. if a court interprets one or more such open-source licenses in a manner that is unfavorable to us, we could be required to make certain of our key software available at no cost. furthermore, open-source software may have security flaws and other deficiencies that could make our solutions less reliable and damage our business.
our business strategy depends on the ability to source adequate transmission capacity and the servers we need to operate our network; failure to have access to those resources could lead to loss of revenue and service disruptions.
our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by third party telecommunications network providers and access to co-location facilities to house our servers. there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers, particularly those under cyber-attack. failure to put in place the capacity we require to operate our business effectively could result in a reduction in, or disruption of, service to our customers and ultimately a loss of those customers. the akamai intelligent edge platform relies on hundreds of thousands of servers deployed around the world. disruptions in our supply chain could prevent us from purchasing servers at attractive prices or at all. for example, it may be difficult to purchase servers and other equipment that are manufactured in areas that face disruptions to operations due to unrest or other political activity, public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as the novel coronavirus), safety issues, natural disasters or general economic conditions. failure to have adequate server deployment could harm the quality of our services, which could lead to the loss of customers and revenue.
our stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and your investment could lose value.
the market price of our common stock has historically been volatile. trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including the following:
•   quarterly variations in operating results;
•   announcements by our customers related to their businesses that could be viewed as impacting their usage of our solutions;
•   market speculation about whether we are a takeover target or considering a strategic transaction;
•   activism by any single large stockholder or combination of stockholders;
•   changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;
•   failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts;
•   purchases or sales of our stock by our officers and directors;
•   general economic conditions and other macro-economic factors;
•   repurchases of shares of our common stock;
•   successful cyber-attacks affecting our network or systems;
•   performance by other companies in our industry; and
•   geopolitical conditions such as acts of terrorism or military conflicts.
furthermore, our revenue, particularly that portion attributable to usage of our solutions beyond customer commitments, can be difficult to forecast, and, as a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially. this concern is particularly acute with respect to our media and commerce customers. we have introduced new billing models over the years, including recently offering a zero overage plan that eliminates surcharges for certain traffic. in the future, our customer contracting models may change to move away from a committed revenue structure to a "pay-as-you-go" approach, which could make it easier for customers to reduce the amount of business they do with us or leave altogether. changes in billing models and committed revenue requirements could, therefore, create challenges with our forecasting processes. because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short-term, revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability. if we announce revenue or profitability results that do not meet or exceed our guidance or make changes in our guidance with respect to future operating results, our stock price may decrease significantly as a result.
any of these events, as well as other circumstances discussed in these risk factors, may cause the price of our common stock to fall. in addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices of stock of publicly-traded technology companies in particular, have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. these broad stock market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.
if the accounting estimates we make, and the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate, our actual results may be adversely affected.
our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about, among other things, taxes, revenue recognition, stock-based compensation costs, capitalization of internal-use software development costs, investments, contingent obligations, allowance for doubtful accounts, intangible assets, and restructuring charges. these estimates and judgments affect, among other things, the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made. if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to, among other things, accrue significant additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations, which in turn could adversely affect our stock price. in addition, new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future that could adversely affect our reported financial results.
we may have exposure to greater-than-anticipated tax liabilities.
our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items such as equity-related compensation. we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions. these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions. we are currently subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions including the commonwealth of massachusetts. in the second quarter of 2018, we filed an appeal with the massachusetts appellate tax board contesting adverse audit findings relating to our eligibility to claim certain tax benefits and exemptions. the appeal hearing was held in late 2019. if the outcome of this appeal and other audits are adverse to us, our reserves may not be adequate to cover our total actual liability, and we would need to take a financial charge. although we believe our estimates, our reserves and the positions we have taken in all jurisdictions are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. as a result, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.
we have complied with section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 by assessing, strengthening and testing our system of internal controls. even though we concluded our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report, we need to continue to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them to changes as our business evolves and we rearrange management responsibilities and reorganize our business. this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section 404 is expensive and time-consuming and requires significant management attention. we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section 404. furthermore, as our business changes, including by expanding our operations in different markets, increasing reliance on channel partners and completing acquisitions, our internal controls may become more complex and we will be required to expend significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective. failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remediated, could reduce the market's confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price.
any failure to meet our debt obligations would damage our business.
as of the date of this report, we had total par value of $1,150.0 million of convertible senior notes outstanding due in 2027 and we had total par value of $1,150.0 million of convertible senior notes outstanding due in 2025. we also entered into a credit facility in may 2018 that provides for an initial $500.0 million in revolving loans; under specified circumstances, we would be able to borrow an additional $500.0 million thereunder. our ability to repay any amounts we borrow under our credit facility, refinance the notes, make cash payments in connection with conversions of the notes or repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change (as defined in the applicable indenture governing the notes) will depend on market conditions and our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. we also may not use the cash we have raised through future borrowing under the credit facility or the issuance of the convertible senior notes in an optimally productive and profitable manner. if we are unable to remain profitable or if we use more cash than we generate in the future, our level of indebtedness at such time could adversely affect our operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for additional capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. in addition, if we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the notes, we would be required to issue significant amounts of our common stock, which would be dilutive to the stock of existing stockholders. if we do not have sufficient cash to repurchase the notes following a fundamental change, we would be in default under the terms of the notes, which could seriously harm our business. although the terms of our credit facility include certain financial ratios that potentially limit our future indebtedness, the terms of the notes do not do so. if we incur significantly more debt, this could intensify the risks described above.
we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
our board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock. if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.
we have customer contracts with the u.s. government, as well as foreign, state and local governments and their respective agencies. such government entities often have the right to terminate these contracts at any time, without cause. there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending. most of our government contracts are subject to legislative approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts. these factors combine to potentially limit the revenue we derive from government contracts in the future. additionally, government contracts generally have requirements that are more complex than those found in commercial enterprise agreements and therefore are more costly to comply with. such contracts are also subject to audits and investigations that could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business.
litigation may adversely impact our business.
from time to time, we are or may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including patent, commercial, product liability, breach of contract, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. in addition, under our charter, we could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers in connection with their involvement in certain actions, suits, investigations and other proceedings. such matters can be time-consuming, divert management's attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable and may not be covered by insurance, there can be no assurance that the results of any litigation matters will not have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
global climate change and related natural resource conservation regulations could adversely impact our business.
the long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and our industry in particular remain unknown. changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. catastrophic natural disasters could negatively impact our office locations. in response to concerns about global climate change, governments may adopt new regulations affecting the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel sources. our deployed network of servers consumes significant energy resources, including those generated by the burning of fossil fuels. while we have invested in projects to support renewable energy development, our customers, investors and other stakeholders may require us to take more steps to demonstrate that we are taking ecologically responsible measures in operating our business. the costs and any expenses we may incur to make our network more energy-efficient and comply with any new regulations could make us less profitable in future periods. failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could lead to fines, lost revenue and damage to our reputation.
because we currently do not intend to pay dividends, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.
we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, for use in the operation of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock. as a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.
provisions of our charter, by-laws and delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.
provisions of our charter, by-laws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to control or acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. these provisions include:
•   a classified board structure that is being phased out over time, with approximately two-thirds of our board of directors up for re-election this year;
•   our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director;
•   stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting; and
•   our board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock.
further, as a delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain delaware anti-takeover provisions. under delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, or md&a, should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. see "risk factors" elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements. the forward-looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof.
overview we provide solutions for securing, delivering and optimizing content and business applications over the internet. the key factors that influence our financial success are our ability to build on recurring revenue commitments for our security and performance offerings, increase media traffic on our network, effectively managing the prices we charge for our solutions, develop new products and carefully manage our capital spending and other expenses.
revenue for most of our solutions, our customers commit to contracts having terms of a year or longer, which allows us to have a consistent and predictable base level of revenue. in addition to a base level of revenue, we are also dependent on media customers where usage of our solutions is more variable. as a result, our revenue is impacted by the amount of media and software download traffic we serve on our network, the rate of adoption of gaming, social media and video platform offerings, the timing and variability of customer-specific one-time events and the impact of seasonal variations on our business. the ability to expand our product portfolio and to effectively manage the prices we charge for our solutions are also key factors impacting our revenue growth.
we have observed the following trends related to our revenue in recent years:
•   increased sales of our security solutions have made a significant contribution to revenue growth. we plan to continue to invest in this area with a focus on further enhancing our product portfolio and extending our go-to-market capabilities.
•   we have experienced increases in the amount of traffic delivered for customers that use our solutions for video, gaming and software downloads, contributing to an increase in our revenue in 2019 as compared to 2018.
•   we have increased committed recurring revenue from our solutions by increasing sales of incremental solutions to our existing customers and adding new customers; however, we have also experienced slower revenue growth in recent quarters particularly in our web performance solutions. we expect the trend of slower revenue growth to continue in 2020 as our commerce customers continue to experience financial pressure and we face more contract renewals with large media and other customers in 2020 as compared to 2019.
•   the prices paid by some of our customers have declined, particularly in the context of contract renewals and large media consolidations, reflecting the impact of competition and volume discounts. our revenue would have been higher absent these price declines.
•   in recent years, revenue from our international operations has been growing at a faster pace than from our u.s. operations, particularly in terms of new customer acquisition and cross-selling of incremental solutions. because we publicly report in u.s. dollars, if the dollar continues to strengthen, our reported revenue results will be negatively impacted.
•   we have experienced variations in certain types of revenue from quarter to quarter. in particular, we typically experience higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year for some of our solutions as a result of holiday season activity. in addition, we experience quarterly variations in revenue attributable to, among other things, the nature and timing of software and gaming releases by our customers; whether there are large live sporting or other events that increase the amount of media traffic on our network; and the frequency and timing of purchases of custom solutions.
expenses our level of profitability is also impacted by our expenses, including direct costs to support our revenue such as bandwidth and co-location costs. we have observed the following trends related to our profitability in recent years:
•   our profitability improved in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to higher revenue as well as the effects of cost savings and efficiency initiatives we have undertaken. we expect to continue to undertake efforts intended to improve the efficiency of operations. if we are able to continue our efficiency efforts such that our rate of revenue growth exceeds our expense growth rate, we anticipate overall profitability improvement in 2020 as compared to 2019.
•   network bandwidth costs represent a significant portion of our cost of revenue. historically, we have been able to mitigate increases in these costs by reducing our network bandwidth costs per unit and investing in internal-use software development to improve the performance and efficiency of our network. our total bandwidth costs may increase in the future as a result of expected higher traffic levels and serving more traffic from higher cost regions. we will need to continue to effectively manage our bandwidth costs to maintain current levels of profitability.
•   co-location costs are also a significant portion of our cost of revenue. by improving our internal-use software and managing our hardware deployments to enable us to use servers more efficiently, we have been able to manage the growth of co-location costs. we expect to continue to scale our network in the future and will need to continue to effectively manage our co-location costs to maintain current levels of profitability.
•   payroll and related costs stabilized in 2019 as compared to prior years. we expect to continue to manage our headcount and payroll costs in the future to focus investments on certain areas of the business while maintaining efficient operations in others. we expect to continue to hire employees in support of our strategic initiatives, but do not expect overall headcount to increase significantly in 2020.
•   depreciation and amortization expense related to our network equipment decreased during 2019 as compared to 2018. we implemented software and hardware initiatives to manage our global network more efficiently; as a result, the expected average useful life of our network assets, primarily servers, increased from four years to five years, effective january 1, 2019. we expect to continue to invest in our network in 2020, which will increase our capital expenditures and resulting depreciation expense.
we report our revenue in two divisions: the web division and the media and carrier division. revenue by division is a customer-focused reporting view that reflects revenue from customers that are managed by the division. as the purchasing patterns and required account expertise of customers change over time, we may reassign a customer from one division to another. in 2019, we reassigned some of our customers from the media and carrier division to the web division and revised historical results in order to reflect the most recent categorization and to provide a comparable view for all periods presented.

the increase in our revenue in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily the result of higher media traffic volumes, including from our large internet platform customers, and continued strong growth in sales of our cloud security solutions. cloud security solutions revenue for the year ended december 31, 2019 was $848.7 million, compared to $658.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, which represents a 28.8% increase. the increase in our revenue in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily the result of higher media traffic volumes, increased sales of our new product offerings and continued strong growth in our cloud security solutions. cloud security solutions revenue for the year ended december 31, 2018 was $658.7 million, compared to $487.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, which represents a 35.1% increase.
the increase in web division revenue for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily the result of increased sales of both new and existing cloud security solutions to this customer base. the increase in web division revenue in 2018 as compared to 2017 was due to increased purchases of new solutions and upgrades to existing services by this customer base. increased sales of our cloud security solutions to web division customers, in particular our kona site defender, prolexic and managed security solutions, as well as our new bot manager offering were a principal contributor to our overall revenue growth in 2018.
the increase in media and carrier division revenue for 2019 as compared to 2018, as well as 2018 as compared to 2017, was primarily the result of increased customer traffic volumes from video delivery and gaming customers and sales of cloud security solutions to this customer base.

the u.s. growth rate for 2019 was negatively impacted by a reduction in prices paid by some of our customers, partially offset by an increase in revenue from our large internet platform customers, as these customers are based in the u.s. for the year ended december 31, 2019, approximately 41% of our revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the u.s., compared to 38% for the year ended december 31, 2018, and 34% for the year ended december 31, 2017. no single country outside of the u.s. accounted for 10% or more of revenue during any of these periods.
internationally, during 2019 and 2018, we continued to see strong revenue growth from our operations in the asia-pacific region. changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our revenue by $33.9 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, and positively impacted our revenue by $11.2 million in 2018 as compared to 2017.

the increase in total cost of revenue for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to increases in:
•   amortization of internal-use software as we continued to release internally-developed software onto our network related to new product launches and significant enhancements to our existing services;
•   network build-out and supporting service costs due to investments in network expansion;
•   bandwidth fees to support the increase in traffic served on our network; and
•   payroll and related costs due to increased hiring to support revenue growth.
these increases were partially offset by lower depreciation expense of network equipment of $31.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, due to software and hardware initiatives we implemented to manage our global network more efficiently, resulting in an increase in the expected average useful life of our network assets, primarily servers, from four to five years effective january 1, 2019.
the increase in total cost of revenue for 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to increases in amortization of internal-use software as we continued to release internally-developed software onto our network related to new product launches and significant enhancements to our existing services throughout 2017 and 2018; payroll and related costs, as well as stock-based compensation, due to increased hiring in our services team in 2017 to support revenue growth; and amounts paid for network build-out and supporting services related to installation fees and investments in our network. these increases were partially offset by decreases in our bandwidth and co-location fees as we have been able to more effectively manage our network and reduce our costs.
during 2020, we plan to continue to focus our efforts on expanding our operating margins, including continuing to manage our bandwidth and co-location costs. we do anticipate amortization of internal-use software development costs to increase in 2020 as we plan to continue making investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand and that we will continue to deliver more traffic to existing customers.

the increases in research and development expenses for 2019 as compared to 2018, as well as 2018 as compared to 2017, were due to increases in payroll and related costs, including stock-based compensation, as a result of headcount growth to support investments in new product development and network scaling, and as a result of employees joining us through acquisitions. these increases were partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs due to continued investment in internal-use software deployed on our network.
research and development costs are expensed as incurred, other than certain internal-use software development costs eligible for capitalization. capitalized development costs consist of payroll and related costs for personnel and external consulting expenses involved in the development of internal-use software used to deliver our services and operate our network. for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we capitalized $33.7 million, $31.9 million and $26.8 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation. these capitalized internal-use software development costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives, which is generally two years, but can be up to seven years based on the software developed and its expected useful life.
we expect research and development costs to increase in 2020 as we maintain our focus on innovation; however, we do not expect these costs to increase as a percentage of revenue.

the increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to increased spending for marketing programs and other expenses primarily for a customer conference that took place during 2019 that did not take place in 2018, partially offset by a decrease in payroll and related costs and stock-based compensation due to reduced headcount in the marketing organization. the increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to growth in payroll and related costs from headcount increases in 2017 to support our divisions' go-to-market strategies in pursuit of growth opportunities.
during 2020 we do not expect significant increases in sales and marketing expenses as we plan to continue to carefully manage costs in an our efforts to refine and optimize our go-to-market efforts and improve operating margins.

the decrease in general and administrative expenses for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to:
•   a one-time endowment contribution to the akamai foundation in 2018;
•   a reduction in legal and stockholder matter costs related to matters in 2018 that did not recur in 2019; and
•   and a decrease in other expenses due to a decrease in non-income tax reserves.
these decreases were partially offset by cessation of payments to us under the terms of a litigation settlement agreement with limelight networks, inc., or limelight.
our general and administrative expenses increased in 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to the one-time endowment contribution to the akamai foundation, legal and stockholder matter costs related to a settlement charge from our litigation with limelight, amounts paid to professional service providers for advisory services provided in connection with a non-routine stockholder matter and higher stock-based compensation expense, primarily due to performance-based awards that experienced higher achievement in 2018 as compared to 2017.

the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2019 as compared to 2018, as well as 2018 as compared to 2017, was the result of amortization of assets related to our recent acquisitions.
based on acquired intangible assets as of december 31, 2019, future amortization is expected to be approximately $41.0 million, $36.2 million, $31.0 million, $23.9 million and $16.6 million for the years ending december 31, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.

the restructuring charge in 2019 was primarily the result of management actions to focus on investments with the potential to accelerate revenue growth. the restructuring charge relates to certain headcount reductions and software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be implemented due to this action.
the restructuring charge in 2018 was primarily the result of management actions intended to re-balance investments to focus on long-term growth and scale. the restructuring charge relates to certain headcount reductions and software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be implemented due to this action.
the restructuring charge in 2017 was primarily the result of management actions intended to shift focus to more critical areas of the business and away from products that have not seen expected commercial success. the restructuring was also intended to facilitate cost efficiencies and savings. the restructuring charge relates to certain headcount and facility reductions and certain capitalized internal-use software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be completed and implemented due to this action.
in addition to the actions described above, we have also recognized restructuring charges for redundant employees, facilities and contracts associated with completed acquisitions.
we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of $4.0 million to $7.0 million in 2020 as a result of the action committed to in the fourth quarter of 2019.

for the periods presented, interest income primarily consists of interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities. the increase to interest income in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily the result of increased cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as a result of our august 2019 issuance of $1,150.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2027. the increase to interest income in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily the result of increased cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as a result of our may 2018 issuance of $1,150.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2025.
interest expense is related to our debt transactions, which are described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the increase to interest expense for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to the august 2019 issuance of $1,150.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2027, which bear regular interest of 0.375%, but have an effective interest rate of 3.1% due to the conversion feature. the increase to interest expense for 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to the may 2018 issuance of $1,150.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2025, which bear regular interest of 0.125%, but have an effective interest rate of 4.26% due to the conversion feature.
other (expense) income, net for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses mainly due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany and other non-functional currency transactions. other (expense) income, net may fluctuate in the future based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates or other events. other (expense) income, net also includes gains and losses from certain equity investments.

the increase in the provision for income taxes for 2019 as compared to 2018 was mainly due to an increase in profit before taxes and an increase in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to state credits. these amounts were partially offset by the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates and the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statutes of limitations.
the decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2018 as compared to 2017 was mainly due to the reduction in the u.s. federal statutory tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% as part of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act, or tcja, that was enacted in december 2017, an increase in the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and the net impact of the tcja recorded in 2017. these amounts were partially offset by an intercompany sale of intellectual property and an increase in non-deductible executive compensation.
for the year ended december 31, 2019, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statutes of limitations, foreign income taxed at lower rates, the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and the benefit of the u.s. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. these amounts were partially offset by the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to state tax credits, non-deductible executive compensation, an intercompany sale of intellectual property and state income taxes.
for the year ended december 31, 2018, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to foreign income taxed at lower rates, the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, a decrease in the provisional amount of the one-time transition tax that was recorded in 2017, the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statutes of limitations and the benefit of u.s. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. these amounts were partially offset by an intercompany sale of intellectual property and state income taxes.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to foreign income taxed at lower rates, the re-measurement of deferred taxes at lower tax rates expected to be in place upon realization due to the tcja, which was enacted in december 2017, the impact of the release of the acquisition-related reserve due to the expiration of the local statute of limitations and the benefit of u.s. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. these amounts were partially offset by a provisional charge for the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings taken as part of the tcja, the effects of stock-based compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance for share-based payments and state income taxes.
our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events, such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards, tax law changes and settlements of tax audits and assessments. our effective income tax rate is also impacted by, and may fluctuate in any given period because of, the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ depending on the local statutory rates.
refer to note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective income tax rate in the next 12 months and the potential impact that current litigation related to an adverse audit finding could have on our results of operations.

during 2019, we started recognizing our share of earnings from our previously announced investment with mitsubishi ufj financial group, or mufg. our investment with mufg established a joint venture, go-net, to offer a new blockchain-based online payment network. we recorded a loss of $1.1 million dollars which reflects our share of the losses incurred by go-net. we expect to record additional losses in 2020 and beyond as go-net continues executing on the early stages of its business plan.
non-gaap financial measures in addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america, or gaap, we provide additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with gaap, or non-gaap financial measures. management uses non-gaap financial measures, in addition to gaap financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, to measure executive compensation and to evaluate our financial performance. these non-gaap financial measures are non-gaap income from operations, non-gaap operating margin, non-gaap net income, non-gaap net income per share, adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, capital expenditures and impact of foreign currency exchange rates, as discussed below.
management believes that these non-gaap financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business, as they facilitate comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. management also believes that these non-gaap financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. these non-gaap financial measures may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature, infrequent or not reflective of our ongoing operating results.
the non-gaap financial measures do not replace the presentation of our gaap financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with gaap.
the non-gaap adjustments, and our basis for excluding them from non-gaap financial measures, are outlined below:
•   amortization of acquired intangible assets - we have incurred amortization of intangible assets, included in our gaap financial statements, related to various acquisitions we have made. the amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition; therefore, we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non-gaap financial measures to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-acquisition operating results.
•   stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation - although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to our employees, the grant date fair value varies based on the stock price at the time of grant, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. this makes the comparison of our current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to interpret; therefore, we believe it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation from our non-gaap financial measures in order to highlight the performance of our core business and to be consistent with the way many investors evaluate our performance and compare our operating results to peer companies.
•   acquisition-related costs - acquisition-related costs include transaction fees, advisory fees, due diligence costs and other direct costs associated with strategic activities. in addition, subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amounts of contingent consideration and indemnification associated with specific acquisitions are included within acquisition-related costs. these amounts are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions. we exclude acquisition-related costs from our non-gaap financial measures to provide a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of our acquisition transactions and do not reflect our core operations.
•   restructuring charges - we have incurred restructuring charges that are included in our gaap financial statements, primarily related to workforce reductions and estimated costs of exiting facility lease commitments. we exclude these items from our non-gaap financial measures when evaluating our continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. in addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business.
•   amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and amortization of capitalized interest expense - in august 2019, we issued $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 with a coupon interest rate of 0.375%. in may 2018, we issued $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2025 with a coupon interest rate of 0.125%. in february 2014, we issued $690 million of convertible senior notes due 2019 with a coupon interest rate of 0%. the imputed interest rates of these convertible senior notes were 3.10%, 4.26% and 3.20%, respectively. this is a result of the debt discounts recorded for the conversion features that are required to be separately accounted for as equity under gaap, thereby reducing the carrying values of the convertible debt instruments. the debt discounts are amortized as interest expense together with the issuance costs of the debt. the interest expense excluded from our non-gaap results is comprised of these non-cash components and is excluded from management's assessment of our operating performance because management believes the non-cash expense is not representative of ongoing operating performance.
•   gains and losses on investments - we have recorded gains and losses from the disposition, changes to fair value and impairment of certain investments. we believe excluding these amounts from our non-gaap financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to them are not representative of our core business operations and ongoing operating performance.
•   legal and stockholder matter costs - we have incurred losses related to the settlement of legal matters and costs from professional service providers related to a non-routine stockholder matter. we believe excluding these amounts from our non-gaap financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to them are not representative of our core business operations.
•   endowment of akamai foundation - during the second quarter of 2018, we incurred a charge to endow the akamai foundation. we believe excluding this amount from non-gaap financial measures is useful to investors as this one-time event is not representative of our core business operations.
•   transformation costs - we have incurred professional services fees associated with internal transformation programs designed to improve operating margins and that are part of a planned program intended to significantly change the manner in which business is conducted. we believe excluding these amounts from our non-gaap financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events and activities giving rise to them occur infrequently and are not representative of our core business operations and ongoing operating performance.
•   income and losses from equity method investment - we record income or losses on our share of earnings and losses of our equity method investment. we exclude such income and losses because we lack control over the operations of the investment and the related income and losses are not representative of our core business operations.
•   income tax effect of non-gaap adjustments and certain discrete tax items - the non-gaap adjustments described above are reported on a pre-tax basis. the income tax effect of non-gaap adjustments is the difference between gaap and non-gaap income tax expense. non-gaap income tax expense is computed on non-gaap pre-tax income (gaap pre-tax income adjusted for non-gaap adjustments) and excludes certain discrete tax items (such as recording or releasing of valuation allowances), if any. we believe that applying the non-gaap adjustments and their related income tax effect allows us to highlight income attributable to our core operations.

(1) may not foot due to rounding non-gaap net income per diluted share is calculated as non-gaap net income divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. gaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are adjusted in non-gaap per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to us pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes. under gaap, shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fully-diluted share calculation until they are delivered. however, we would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur, so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of net income per share. unless and until our weighted average stock price is greater than $95.10, the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes due 2025, or $116.18, the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes due 2027, there will be no difference between our gaap and non-gaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.
we consider adjusted ebitda to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends. adjusted ebitda eliminates items that we do not consider to be part of our core operations. we define adjusted ebitda as gaap net income excluding the following items: interest income; income taxes; depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; gains and losses on legal settlements; costs from professional service providers related to a non-routine stockholder matter; costs incurred related to the endowment of the akamai foundation; transformation costs; foreign exchange gains and losses; interest expense; amortization of capitalized interest expense; certain gains and losses on investments; gains and losses from equity method investments; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time. adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda stated as a percentage of revenue.

impact of foreign currency exchange rates revenue and earnings from our international operations have historically been an important contributor to our financial results. consequently, our financial results have been impacted, and management expects they will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken, generally our consolidated results stated in u.s. dollars are negatively impacted.
because exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods. the dollar impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period and comparing them to the reported amount. the percentage change at constant currency presented is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period.
liquidity and capital resources to date, we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash generated by operations. as of december 31, 2019, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which primarily consisted of corporate bonds and u.s. government agency obligations, totaled $2.4 billion. factoring in our outstanding convertible senior notes of $2.3 billion, our net cash at december 31, 2019 was $72.4 million. we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high-quality credit standards, as specified in our investment policy. our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times.
changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in, among other things, working capital items such as accounts receivable, deferred revenue, accounts payable and various accrued expenses, as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases, debt repurchases and issuances, purchases and sales of marketable securities and similar events. we believe our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial flexibility necessary to make investments at opportune times. we expect to continue to evaluate strategic investments to strengthen our business.
as of december 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $255.4 million held in accounts outside the u.s. the tcja establishes a territorial tax system in the u.s., which provides companies with the potential ability to repatriate earnings with minimal u.s. federal income tax impact beginning in 2018. as a result, our liquidity is not materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the u.s.

the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to increased profitability in 2019, partially offset by the timing of cash collections from customers, an increase of $28.8 million in cash paid for income taxes and timing of collections and payments of other working capital items.
the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to increased profitability in 2018, lower cash paid for income taxes due to a lower u.s. federal statutory tax rate due to the application of the tcja during 2018 and the timing of collections and payments of other working capital items. the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2018 as compared to 2017 was partially offset by a one-time contribution to the akamai foundation of $50.0 million, as well as higher annual bonus payouts in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to 2017 due to increased headcount from hiring in 2017.

the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in purchases of marketable securities with the proceeds from our august 2019 issuance of convertible senior notes, cash paid for acquired companies in 2019, increased capital expenditures and cash invested in an equity method investment.
the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2018 as compared to 2017 was driven by marketable securities activities. in 2017, we did not reinvest all proceeds from sales and maturities of our marketable securities which created a cash inflow in that year. the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2018 as compared to 2017 was partially offset by the cash paid in 2017 for the acquisitions of nominum, inc. and soasta, inc.

the change in net cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to our repayment of $690 million of aggregate principal of convertible notes in 2019, partially offset by a decrease in shares repurchased under our repurchase programs.
the change in net cash used in or provided by financing activities during 2018 as compared to 2017 was the result of our issuance of convertible senior notes issued in may 2018 and related note hedge and warrant transactions. the increase was partially offset by an increase in shares repurchased under our repurchase programs.
in february 2016, the board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program that was effective from february 2016 through december 2018. in march 2018, the board of directors increased the share repurchase authorization by $416.7 million, such that the amount that was authorized and available for repurchase in 2018 was $750.0 million. subsequently, effective november 2018, the board of directors authorized an additional $1.1 billion repurchase program through december 2021. our goal for the share repurchase programs is to offset the dilution created by our employee equity compensation programs and provide the flexibility to return capital to shareholders as business and market conditions warrant.
during 2019, 2018 and 2017, we repurchased 4.0 million, 10.2 million and 6.9 million shares of our common stock, respectively, at an average price per share of $82.90, $73.54 and $52.59, respectively. these repurchases have contributed to a decrease to shares outstanding over the past three years.
convertible senior notes in august 2019, we issued $1,150.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2027 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. we intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases, working capital and general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions.
in may 2018, we issued $1,150.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2025 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay at maturity all of our $690.0 million outstanding aggregate principle amount of convertible senior notes due in 2019. in addition, we have used and expect to continue to use the remaining net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases, working capital and general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions.
in february 2014, we issued $690.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. the notes were classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2018. we repaid the full $690.0 million in principal amount of the notes in cash in february 2019, as the notes matured and no conversions occurred.
the terms of the notes and the hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
revolving credit facility in may 2018, we entered into a $500.0 million, five-year revolving credit agreement, or the credit agreement. borrowings under the facility may be used to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. the facility provides for an initial $500.0 million in revolving loans. under specified circumstances, the facility can be increased to up to $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount.
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.25% or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 0.875% to 1.25%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio specified in the credit agreement. regardless of what amounts, if any, are outstanding under the credit agreement, we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0.075% to 0.15%, with such rate being based on our consolidated leverage ratio specified in the credit agreement.
the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. principal covenants include a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio. there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement as of december 31, 2019.
liquidity outlook based on our present business plan, we expect our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and our forecasted cash flows from operations to be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 12 months. our foreseeable cash needs, in addition to our recurring operating costs, include our expected capital expenditures, investments in information technology and facility expansion, opportunistic business acquisitions, anticipated share repurchases, lease and purchase commitments and settlements of other long-term liabilities.

(1) excludes $13.7 million of obligations for operating leases that have not yet commenced. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, as of december 31, 2019, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $32.6 million, including $7.8 million of accrued interest and penalties. we believe that it is reasonably possible that $2.8 million of our unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized by the end of 2020. the settlement period for the remaining amount of the unrecognized tax benefits is unknown.
letters of credit as of december 31, 2019, we had outstanding $7.4 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third party beneficiaries, primarily related to facility leases. these irrevocable letters of credit, which are not included in the table of contractual obligations above, are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect, in some cases, until 2026.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our officers and directors, shareholders of acquired companies, joint venture partners and third parties to which we license technology. generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by a third party due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence. these indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor's accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements. the fair value of guarantees issued or modified during 2019 and 2018 was determined to be immaterial.
legal matters we are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business. we do not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
significant accounting policies and estimates see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for information regarding recent and newly adopted accounting pronouncements.
application of critical accounting policies and estimates overview our md&a is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and related reserves, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, capitalized internal-use software development costs, goodwill and acquired intangible assets, income tax reserves, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets and stock-based compensation. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. actual results may differ from these estimates. for a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
definitions we define our critical accounting policies as those policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes.
review of critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition our contracts with customers sometimes include promises to transfer multiple services to a customer. determining whether services are distinct performance obligations often requires the exercise of judgment by management. advanced features that enhance a main product or service and are highly interrelated are generally not considered distinct; rather, they are combined with the service they relate to into one performance obligation. different determinations related to combining services into performance obligations could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period.
determination of the standalone selling price, or ssp, also requires the exercise of judgment by management. ssp is based on observable inputs such as the price we charge for the service when sold separately, or the discounted list price per management's approved price list. in cases where services are not sold separately or price list rates are not available, a cost-plus-margin approach or adjusted market approach is used to determine ssp. changes to ssp could result in differences in the allocation of transaction price among performance obligations, which could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period.
from time to time, we enter into contracts to sell services or license technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time that we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises. consideration payable to a customer is reviewed as part of the transaction price. if the payment to the customer does not represent payment for a distinct service, revenue is recognized only up to the net amount of consideration after customer payment obligations are considered. different determinations on whether a payment represents a distinct service could result in differences in the amount of revenue recognized.
we may also resell the licenses or services of third parties. if we are acting as an agent in an arrangement with a customer to provide third party services, the transaction price reflects only the net amount to which we will be entitled, after accounting for payments made to the third party responsible for satisfying the performance obligation. different determinations on whether we are acting as an agent or a principal could change the amount of revenue recognized.
accounts receivable and related reserves trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. in addition to trade accounts receivable, our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month. we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance. these reserves primarily consist of allowances for doubtful accounts. increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income.
estimates are used in determining our reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customer-specific, account-by-account basis. the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided. we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers. if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided, any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments.
valuation and impairment of marketable securities we measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period. fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (principally cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities) that have been classified as level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the reporting date. fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. fair values determined by level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability.
marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other-than-temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including, among other factors, the duration of the period that, and extent to which, the fair value is less than cost basis; the financial health of, and business outlook for, the issuer, including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors; overall market conditions and trends; and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, a write-down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established. assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty. write-downs, if recorded, could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio if, among other things, relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment.
impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets we review our long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and acquired intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset. when such events occur, we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. if this comparison indicates that impairment is present, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. if a readily determinable market price does not exist, fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset. the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long-lived assets, the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows. changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations.
goodwill and acquired intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as of december 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. we have concluded that we have one reporting unit and that our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer and the executive management team. we have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to our one reporting unit. the fair value of the reporting unit was based on our market capitalization as of each of december 31, 2019 and 2018, and it was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit at each date.
acquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies, customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, non-compete agreements and acquired license rights. we engaged third party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets. acquired intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets.
income taxes our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards by using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized.
we currently have net deferred tax assets, comprised of net operating loss, or nol, carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences. our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes, management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability, the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards, applicable tax rates, transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies. judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain; therefore, actual results could differ materially from our projections.
we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax positions. these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be more or less than the amount that we estimated.
uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our consolidated financial statements using a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. first, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. if the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained based on technical merit, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that we believe has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
accounting for stock-based compensation we issue stock-based compensation awards including stock options, restricted stock units and deferred stock units. we measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period. we have selected the black-scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards and the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of market-based restricted stock unit awards. determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock. our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods. changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock-based awards, which could have a material impact on our financial statements. judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted. in addition, for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions, we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved. changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense and could materially impact our result of operations.
capitalized internal-use software costs we capitalize salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal-use software development projects, as well as interest expense related to our senior convertible notes. capitalization begins during the application development stage, once the preliminary project stage has been completed. if a project constitutes an enhancement to previously-developed software, we assess whether the enhancement creates additional functionality to the software, thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization. once the project is available for general release, capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization. we periodically assess whether triggering events are present to review internal-use software for impairment. changes in our estimates related to internal-use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period.

item 1a.   risk factors our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. if any of such events should occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. additional risks relating to our securities may be included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the future.
crude oil, natural gas, and ngl price volatility could adversely affect our operating results and the price of our common stock.
our revenues, operating results, and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas, and ngl production. historically, the markets for these commodities have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. for example, the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in 2019 ranged from a high of $66.30 per barrel to a low of $45.89 per barrel. the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in 2019 ranged from a high of $3.59 per mmbtu to a low of $2.07 per mmbtu. the market prices for crude oil, natural gas, and ngls depend on factors beyond our control. these factors include demand, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including:
•   worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil, natural gas, and ngls;
•   actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations, including the organization of the petroleum exporting countries (opec);
•   political conditions and events (including instability, changes in governments, or armed conflict) in oil and gas producing regions;
•   the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories;
•   the price and level of imported foreign crude oil, natural gas, and ngls;
•   the price and availability of alternative fuels, including coal and biofuels;
•   the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure;
•   the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity;
•   weather conditions;
•   domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and
•   the overall economic environment.
our results of operations, as well as the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, are substantially dependent upon the prices of oil, natural gas, and ngls, which have declined significantly since june 2014. despite slight increases in oil and natural gas prices in 2019, prices have remained significantly lower than levels seen in recent years, which has adversely affected our revenues, operating income, cash flow, and proved reserves. continued low prices could have a material adverse impact on our operations and limit our ability to fund capital expenditures. without the ability to fund capital expenditures, we would be unable to replace reserves and production. sustained low prices of crude oil, natural gas, and ngls may further adversely impact our business as follows:
•   limiting our financial condition, liquidity, and/or ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations;
•   reducing the amount of crude oil, natural gas, and ngls that we can produce economically;
•   causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects;
•   reducing our revenues, operating income, and cash flows;
•   limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt;
•   reducing the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, resulting in additional non-cash impairments;
•   reducing the carrying value of our gathering, processing, and transmission facilities, resulting in additional impairments; or
•   reducing the carrying value of goodwill.
14
our ability to sell crude oil, natural gas, or ngls and/or receive market prices for these commodities and/or meet volume commitments under transportation services agreements may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints, the inability to procure and resell volumes economically, and various transportation interruptions.
a portion of our crude oil, natural gas, and ngl production in any region may be interrupted, limited, or shut in from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering systems, processing facilities, or interstate pipelines to transport our production, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flows. additionally, if we are unable to procure and resell third-party volumes at or above a net price that covers the cost of transportation, our cash flows could be adversely affected.
future economic conditions in the u.s. and certain international markets may materially adversely impact our operating results.
current global market conditions and uncertainty, including the economic instability in europe and certain emerging markets, are likely to have significant long-term effects on our operating results. global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. a lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for our oil and gas production as well as lower commodity prices, which would reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability.
weather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and production.
demand for oil and gas are, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impact the price we receive for the commodities we produce. in addition, our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as freezing temperatures, hurricanes in the gulf of mexico, or storms in the north sea, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance programs, and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions, and not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated, or insured against.
our operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage or loss of equipment, and environmental accidents.
our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production, and transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and ngls, including:
•   well blowouts, explosions, and cratering;
•   pipeline or other facility ruptures and spills;
•   fires;
•   formations with abnormal pressures;
•   equipment malfunctions;
•   hurricanes, storms, and/or cyclones, which could affect our operations in areas such as on and offshore the gulf coast and north sea, and other natural and anthropogenic disasters and weather conditions; and
•   surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents, saltwater, or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives.
failure or loss of equipment, as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyberattacks, or natural disasters such as hurricanes, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution, and other damages for which we could be liable. litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a well blowout, explosion, fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, or ground water contamination from hydraulic fracturing chemical additives may result in substantial claims for damages. ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture or surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses. if a significant amount of our production is interrupted, our containment efforts prove to be ineffective, or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
15
a terrorist or cyberattack targeting systems and infrastructure used by us or others in the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations.
our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, and production activities. we depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, communicate with our employees and third-party partners, and conduct many of our activities. unauthorized access to our digital technology could lead to operational disruption, data corruption, communication interruption, loss of intellectual property, loss of confidential and fiduciary data, and loss or corruption of reserves or other proprietary information. strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks, environmental activist group activities, or cyberattacks than other targets in the united states. also, external digital technologies control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution and refining systems in the united states and abroad, which are necessary to transport and market our production. a cyberattack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. any such terrorist attack, environmental activist group activity, or cyberattack that affects the company or our customers, suppliers, or others with whom we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause it to incur a material financial loss, subject it to possible legal claims and liability, and/or damage our reputation.
while certain of our insurance policies may allow for coverage of associated damages resulting from such events, if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. in addition, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur.
while we have experienced cyberattacks in the past, we have not suffered any material losses as a result of such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. further, as cyberattacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. in addition, cyberattacks against us or others in our industry could result in additional regulations, which could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs, insurance coverage cost, or capital expenditures. the company cannot predict the potential impact to our business or the energy industry resulting from additional regulations.
our commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks.
to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. in addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:
•   our production falls short of the hedged volumes;
•   there is a widening of price-basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement;
•   the counterparties to our hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; or
•   an unexpected event materially impacts commodity prices.
the credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us.
we have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, other investment funds, and other institutions. these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. deterioration in the credit or financial markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. we may also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with any hedges. we also have exposure to insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies. in addition, if any lender under our credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender's commitment under our credit facilities.
16
we are exposed to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. this risk of counterparty non-performance is of particular concern given the recent volatility of the financial markets and significant decline in commodity prices, which could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty's liquidity and impair its ability to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. we are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or ability to perform. even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions. furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our hedge providers or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to us by the distressed entity or entities. during periods of falling commodity prices, our hedge receivable positions increase, which increases our exposure. if the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss.
the distressed financial conditions of our purchasers and partners could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or to reimburse us for their share of costs.
concerns about global economic conditions and the volatility of oil, natural gas, and ngl prices have had a significant adverse impact on the oil and gas industry. we are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables. we sell our crude oil, natural gas, and ngls to a variety of purchasers. as operator, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. as a result of current economic conditions and the severe decline in commodity prices, some of our customers and non-operating partners may experience severe financial problems that may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness. we cannot provide assurance that one or more of our financially distressed customers or non-operating partners will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, future results of operations, or future cash flows. furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our customers or non-operating partners or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities. nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.
a downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.
we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the united states. factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, commodity pricing levels, and other factors are also considered by the rating agencies. a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost of future debt; past ratings downgrades have required, and any future downgrades may require, us to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations. throughout 2019, our credit rating remained unchanged by moody's at baa3/stable and standard and poor's at bbb/stable. any future downgrades could result in additional postings of collateral ranging from approximately $864 million to $1.4 billion, depending upon timing and availability of tax relief.
market conditions may restrict our ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs, which may limit our financial flexibility.
the financial markets are subject to fluctuation and are vulnerable to unpredictable shocks. we have a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio, which will require substantial future investment. we and/or our partners may need to seek financing in order to fund these or other future activities. our future access to capital, as well as that of our partners and contractors, could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained. this could significantly delay development of our property interests.
the discontinuation of libor, and the adoption of an alternative reference rate, may have a material adverse impact on our floating rate indebtedness and financing costs.
pursuant to the terms of our revolving credit facility (1) we may elect to use london interbank offering rate (libor) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate on floating interest rate borrowings and (2) the commission payable to the lenders on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit uses libor as a benchmark. in july 2017, the financial conduct authority (the regulatory authority over libor) stated they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of libor after 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternate reference rate. in the united states, the alternative reference rates committee (the working group formed to recommend an alternative rate to libor) has identified the secured overnight financing rate (sofr) as its preferred alternative rate for libor. there can be no guarantee that sofr will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of libor. although the full impact of the transition away from libor, including the discontinuance of libor publication and the adoption of sofr as the replacement rate for libor, remains unclear, these changes may have an adverse impact on our floating rate indebtedness and financing costs under our revolving credit facility.
17
our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations.
the payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations, and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. our board of directors is not required to declare dividends on our common stock and may decide not to declare dividends.
any indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock, including common stock. in addition, under delaware law, dividends on capital stock may only be paid from "surplus," which is the amount by which the fair value of our total assets exceeds the sum of our total liabilities, including contingent liabilities, and the amount of our capital; if there is no surplus, cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid from our net profits for the then-current and/or the preceding fiscal year. further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and delaware law to pay cash dividends on common stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on our common stock.
discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production.
the production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, while related per-unit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. therefore, unless we add reserves through exploration and development activities, identify additional behind-pipe zones, secondary recovery reserves, or tertiary recovery reserves through engineering studies, or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, our estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced. future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. furthermore, if oil or gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase.
we may not realize an adequate return on wells that we drill.
drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. the wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. the costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including, but not limited to:
•   unexpected drilling conditions;
•   pressure or irregularities in formations;
•   equipment failures or accidents;
•   fires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering;
•   marine risks, such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes;
•   other adverse weather conditions; and
•   increases in the cost of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and equipment.
future drilling activities may not be successful, and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. while all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.
material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events or costs may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects.
we are involved in several large development projects, and the completion of these projects may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates. our projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners, timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies, weather conditions, manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment, and other unforeseen events. delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect our large development projects and our ability to participate in large-scale development projects in the future. in addition, our estimates of future development costs are based on current expectation of prices and other costs of equipment and personnel we will need to implement such projects. our actual future development costs may be significantly higher than we currently estimate.
18
if costs become too high, our development projects may become uneconomic to us, and we may be forced to abandon such development projects.
we may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves.
although we perform a review of properties that we acquire that we believe is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete. it generally is not feasible to review in-depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. ordinarily, we will focus our review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample the remainder. however, even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential. inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. even when problems are identified, we often assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. in addition, there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our operating results, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into our ongoing operations.
our liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of our transaction counterparties become the subject of a bankruptcy case.
from time to time we have divested noncore or nonstrategic domestic and international assets. the agreements relating to these transactions contain provisions pursuant to which liabilities related to past and future operations have been allocated between the parties by means of liability assumptions, indemnities, escrows, trusts, and similar arrangements. one of the most significant of these liabilities involves the decommissioning of wells and facilities previously owned by us. one or more of the counterparties in these transactions could fail to perform its obligations under these agreements as a result of financial distress. in the event that any such counterparty were to become the subject of a case or proceeding under title 11 of the united states code or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law (which we collectively refer to as insolvency laws), the counterparty may not perform its obligations under the agreements related to these transactions. in that case, our remedy in the proceeding would be a claim for damages for the breach of the contractual arrangements, which may be either a secured claim or an unsecured claim depending on whether or not we have collateral from the counterparty for the performance of the obligations. resolution of our claim for damages in such a proceeding may be delayed, and we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of the obligations assumed by the counterparties under such agreements should they arise.
despite the provisions in our agreements requiring purchasers of our state or federal leasehold interests to assume certain liabilities and obligations related to such interests, if a purchaser of such interests becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or becomes unable financially to perform such liabilities or obligations, we would expect the relevant governmental authorities to require us to perform and hold us responsible for such liabilities and obligations. in such event, we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.
if a court or a governmental authority were to make any of the foregoing determinations or take any of the foregoing actions, or any similar determination or action, it could adversely impact our cash flows, operations, or financial condition.
crude oil, natural gas, and ngl reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly.
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil, natural gas, and ngl reserves and their value. reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil, natural gas, and ngls that cannot be measured in an exact manner. because of the high degree of judgment involved, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation. our reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices, except where contractual arrangements exist; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. in addition, results of drilling, testing, and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time. the estimates of our proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including:
•   historical production from the area compared with production from other areas;
•   the effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including changes to severance and excise taxes;
•   future operating costs and capital expenditures; and
•   workover and remediation costs.
19
for these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and ngls attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves, and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue, and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates.
additionally, because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. in addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. a change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved.
certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.
a sizeable portion of our acreage is currently undeveloped. unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. if our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, commodity prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals.
we may incur significant costs related to environmental matters.
as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and protection of the environment. these laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution cleanup and other remediation activities resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages, limit or constrain operations in affected areas, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. our efforts to limit our exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to our results of operations. in addition, it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require us to make significant capital expenditures. such capital expenditures could adversely impact our cash flows and our financial condition.
our united states operations are subject to governmental risks.
our united states operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state, and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering rate controls, and environmental protection laws and regulations.
in response to the deepwater horizon incident in the u.s. gulf of mexico in april 2010 and as directed by the secretary of the u.s. department of the interior, the bureau of ocean energy management (boem) and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (bsee) issued guidelines and regulations regarding safety, environmental matters, drilling equipment, and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the gulf of mexico. these regulations imposed additional requirements and caused delays with respect to development and production activities in the gulf of mexico.
with respect to oil and gas operations in the gulf of mexico, the boem has issued a notice to lessees (ntl no. 2016-n01) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the gulf of mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies' oil and gas leases. while requirements under the ntl have not yet been fully implemented by boem, the ntl will likely require that apache provide additional security to boem with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to apache's current ownership interests in various gulf of mexico leases. we are working closely with boem to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security becomes necessary under the ntl. additionally, we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which apache has sold gulf of mexico assets or with whom apache has joint ownership. such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties' solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.
new political developments, the enactment of new or stricter laws or regulations or other governmental actions impacting our united states operations, and increased liability for companies operating in this sector may adversely impact our results of operations.
20
changes to existing regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact our business.
certain countries where we operate, including the united kingdom, either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas (ghg) related fees on our operations. exposure has not been material to date, although a change in existing regulations could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. additionally, there has been discussion in other countries where we operate, including the united states, regarding legislation or regulation of ghg. any such legislation or regulation, if enacted, could either tax or assess some form of ghg-related fees on our operations and could lead to increased operating expenses or cause us to make significant capital investments for infrastructure modifications.
in the event the predictions for rising temperatures and sea levels suggested by reports of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change do transpire, we do not believe those events by themselves are likely to impact our assets or operations. however, any increase in severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our assets and operations.
negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.
negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, waste disposal, oil spills, and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines, and enforcement interpretations. these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens, and increased risk of litigation. moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance, and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. negative public perception could cause the permits we require to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.
changes in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act (the tcja) was signed into law. in addition to reducing the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective january 1, 2018, certain provisions in the tcja move the u.s. away from a worldwide tax system and closer to a territorial system for earnings of foreign corporations, establishing a participation exemption system for taxation of foreign income. the new law includes a transition rule to effect this participation exemption regime. the tcja also includes provisions which could impact or limit the company's ability to deduct interest expense or utilize net operating losses.
the u.s. federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and gas exploration, development, and extraction may be further modified by administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time. previous legislative proposals, if enacted into law, could make significant changes to such laws, including the elimination of certain key u.s. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. these changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. the passage or adoption of these changes, or similar changes, could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development. we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be enacted. any such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
proposed federal, state, or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our operating and capital costs.
several proposals are before the u.s. congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the safe drinking water act. several states and political subdivisions are considering legislation, ballot initiatives, executive orders, or other actions to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to induced seismicity. in addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so. we routinely use fracturing techniques in the u.s. and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore. it is typically done at substantial depths in formations with low permeability.
21
although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the governmental actions regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal, state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the u.s.
international operations have uncertain political, economic, and other risks.
our operations outside the united states are based primarily in egypt and the united kingdom. on a barrel equivalent basis, approximately 41 percent of our 2019 production was outside the united states, and approximately 32 percent of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves on december 31, 2019, were located outside the united states. as a result, a significant portion of our production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations including, but not limited to:
•   general strikes and civil unrest;
•   the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation and resource nationalization, and forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;
•   import and export regulations;
•   taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;
•   price control;
•   transportation regulations and tariffs;
•   constrained oil or natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area;
•   exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluations, or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds;
•   laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade, including trade sanctions;
•   the effects of the u.k.'s withdrawal from the european union, including any resulting instability in global financial markets or the value of foreign currencies such as the british pound;
•   the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we currently operate;
•   the possible inability to subject foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of courts in the united states; and
•   difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations.
foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes. if a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or be lost. even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting management's attention from our more significant assets. certain regions of the world in which we operate have a history of political and economic instability. this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as ours. in an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of our assets. this could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability.
the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities, as have occurred in countries and regions in which we operate, may have on the oil and gas industry in general and on our operations in particular is not known at this time. uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, processing plants, and refineries, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. we may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities.

a deterioration of conditions in egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in egypt could have an adverse impact on our business.
deterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with egpc, or threats or acts of terrorism could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our operations in egypt, excluding the impacts of a one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed 21 percent of our 2019 production and accounted for 13 percent of our year-end estimated proved reserves and 23 percent of our estimated discounted future net cash flows.
our operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations.
our operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly between the u.s. dollar and the british pound. our financial statements, presented in u.s. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies.
we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements, and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations.
we conduct many of our e&p operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not an operator under the agreement. there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and, therefore, decisions may be made which are not what we believe to be in our best interest. moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations, and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. in either case, the value of our investment may be adversely affected.
we face strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas e&p industry. we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisitions of oil and gas leases, properties, and reserves, equipment and labor required to explore, develop, and operate those properties, and marketing of crude oil, natural gas, and ngl production. crude oil, natural gas, and ngl prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess and have established strategic, long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. as a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. in addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production, such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels, and the application of government regulations. we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other specialists. these competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
our insurance policies do not cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure.
exploration for and production of crude oil, natural gas, and ngls can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other events such as blowouts, cratering, fires, explosions, and loss of well control, which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the environment. our international operations are also subject to political risk. the insurance coverage that we maintain against certain losses or liabilities arising from our operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability; moreover, insurance is not available to us against all operational risks.
certain anti-takeover provisions in our charter and delaware law could delay or prevent a hostile takeover.
our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to determine the voting rights and dividend rights, dividend rates, liquidation preferences, conversion rights, redemption rights, including sinking fund provisions and redemption prices, and other terms and rights of each series of preferred stock. in addition, delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock. these provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts that could result in an acquisition of us that would have been financially beneficial to our shareholders.

we own an approximate 79 percent interest in altus, which holds substantially all of our former gathering, processing and transmission assets in alpine high. altus may be subject to different risks than those described in this form 10-k.
we own an approximate 79 percent interest in altus, which holds substantially all of our former gathering, processing and transmission assets in alpine high. altus owns, develops, and operates a midstream energy asset network in the permian basin of west texas, anchored by midstream service contracts to service apache's production from its alpine high resource play. altus primarily generates revenue by providing fee-based natural gas gathering, compression, processing and transmission services. given the nature of its business, altus may be subject to different and additional risks than those described in this form 10-k. for a description of these risks, please refer to the forms 10-k and 10-q filed by altm.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k, and the risk factors and related information set forth in part i, item 1a and part ii, item 7a of this form 10-k. this section of this form 10-k generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this form 10-k are incorporated by reference to "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018 (filed with the sec on march 1, 2019).
overview apache's mission is to grow in an innovative, safe, environmentally responsible, and profitable manner for the long-term benefit of its stakeholders. apache is focused on rigorous portfolio management, disciplined financial structure, and optimization of returns.
apache corporation, a delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and ngls. apache currently has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the u.s., egypt, and offshore the u.k. in the north sea (north sea). apache also has exploration interests in suriname and other international locations that may, over time, result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities. apache's midstream business is operated by altus midstream company through its subsidiary altus midstream lp (collectively, altus). altus owns, develops, and operates a midstream energy asset network in the permian basin of west texas. additionally, altus owns equity interests in a total of four permian basin pipelines that will access various points along the texas gulf coast, providing it with fully integrated, wellhead-to-water connectivity.
apache's u.s. unconventional assets are complemented by its conventional international assets in egypt and the north sea, each of which adds to the company's inventory of exploration and development opportunities and generates cash flows in excess of current capital investments, facilitating the company's ability to develop its onshore u.s. properties while maintaining financial flexibility in a volatile commodity price environment. apache's diverse portfolio and asset inventory allows for very flexible allocation of capital across the portfolio. consistent with this strategy, apache closely monitors hydrocarbon pricing fundamentals and will reallocate capital as part of its ongoing planning process. for additional detail on the company's forward capital investment outlook, refer to the "capital and operational outlook" below.
for 2019, apache reduced its upstream capital costs incurred by approximately 27 percent compared to the prior year in response to lower realized commodity prices. worldwide crude oil price realizations declined 8 percent, and natural gas and natural gas liquids price realizations were lower by 27 percent and 41 percent, respectively, compared to 2018. apache's capital spending reduction aligned with its $2.9 billion of cash from operating activities generated in 2019, which was down $910 million or 24 percent from the prior year. during the year, the company advanced key environmental, social and governance initiatives, met corporate goals around capital spending and cash returns, and further streamlined and repositioned its asset portfolio. specifically, the company closed on several divestitures of non-core, gas-weighted assets in the oklahoma and texas panhandle areas. these decisions progressed apache's efforts to invest to prioritize long-term returns and cash flow, strengthen its balance sheet, and maintain the company's dividend.
during 2019, apache reported a loss attributable to common stock of $3.6 billion, or $9.43 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $40 million, or $0.11 per share in 2018. the 2019 results include asset impairments of $2.9 billion and unproved leasehold impairments of $619 million. these non-cash impairments were primarily related to the company's upstream assets in alpine high and gathering and processing assets from the consolidated results of altus midstream. given the prevailing gas and ngl price environment and disappointing performance of recent multi-well development pads, apache materially reduced planned investment and currently has no future drilling plans at alpine high.

operational highlights key operational highlights for the year include:
united states
•   equivalent production from the permian region, which accounts for 91 percent of apache's total u.s. production, increased 21 percent from 2018 to 2019 driven by the success of the midland basin oil-focused drilling program and production increases at its alpine high field. the permian region averaged 11 operated rigs during the year, drilling 233 gross wells.
international
•   the egypt region's gross equivalent production decreased 7 percent and net production decreased 11 percent from 2018 primarily a result of natural decline and fewer wells brought on-line during the period. the region continues to build and enhance its robust drilling inventory, supplemented with recent seismic acquisitions and new play concept evaluations, on both new and existing acreage.
•   the north sea region averaged 3 rigs during 2019, drilling 11 gross development wells with a 100 percent success rate. during the year, the region averaged production of 61 mboe/d and contributed $1.3 billion of revenues. production increased 9 percent from 2018, primarily the result of production from the garten field, which came on-line in november 2018.
•   the north sea region's storr exploration discovery came on-line in the fourth quarter of 2019, and its second well at garten came on-line in the first quarter of 2020. the first well at the company's storr development is a high-rate gas condensate well that is tied back to existing infrastructure at the beryl alpha platform. the garten #2 well encountered approximately 1,200 feet of net pay and compares favorably to the garten #1 well, which came on-line in november 2018 with initial 30-day production rates of 13 mb/d and 17 mmcf/d from 700 feet of net pay. apache holds a 100 percent working interest in the garten complex.
•   during 2019, the company drilled an exploration well, the maka central-1, in block 58 offshore suriname and announced a significant oil discovery in january 2020. the well successfully tested the presence of hydrocarbons in multiple stacked targets in the upper cretaceous-aged campanian and santonian intervals. the well confirmed 73 meters of oil pay and 50 meters of light oil and gas condensate pay, and appraisal planning is underway. the company began drilling its second exploration well, sapakara west-1, in january 2020. following completion of the sapakara west-1, the company will drill a third, and likely a fourth exploration test in block 58 during 2020.
•   in december 2019, apache entered into a joint venture agreement to explore and develop block 58 offshore suriname. under the terms of the agreement, apache and total s.a. will each hold a 50 percent working interest in block 58, which comprises approximately 1.4 million acres in water depths ranging from less than 100 meters to more than 2,100 meters. in exchange for a 50 percent interest, apache will receive various forms of consideration, including $5 billion of carry for its first $7.5 billion of appraisal and development capital and 25 percent carry on all appraisal and development capital beyond its first $7.5 billion. the company also received $100 million at closing and $75 million in the first quarter of 2020 for reimbursement of 50 percent of all costs incurred on block 58 to date. apache will receive an additional $75 million upon achievement of first oil production. apache will operate the drilling of the first three exploration wells in the block (and may operate a fourth), including the maka central-1 well, and subsequently transfer operatorship to total.

acquisition and divestiture activity over apache's 65-year history, the company has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to capitalize quickly and decisively on changes in its industry and economic conditions. a key component of this strategy is to continuously review and optimize apache's portfolio of assets in response to these changes. most recently, apache has completed a series of divestitures designed to monetize nonstrategic assets and enhance apache's portfolio in order to allocate resources to more impactful exploration and development opportunities. these divestments include:
•   midcontinent/gulf coast divestiture in the second quarter of 2019, apache completed the sale of non-core, gas-weighted assets in the woodford-scoop and stack plays for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $223 million. in the third quarter of 2019, apache completed the sale of non-core, gas-weighted assets in the western anadarko basin of
29
oklahoma and texas for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $322 million and the assumption of asset retirement obligations of $49 million.
•   u.s. leasehold divestitures &amp; other during 2019, the company also completed the sale of certain other non-core producing assets, gpt assets, and leasehold acreage, primarily in the permian region, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of $73 million.
•   altus transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018, the company completed the previously announced agreement with altus midstream company and its then wholly-owned subsidiary altus midstream lp (collectively, altus). altus owns gas gathering, processing, and transmission assets in the permian basin of west texas, anchored by midstream contracts to service apache's production from its alpine high resource play. altus primarily generates revenue by providing fee-based natural gas gathering, compression, processing, and transmission services.
•   altus pipeline options as part of the altus transaction, apache contributed options to acquire equity interests in five separate third-party pipeline projects to altus midstream lp and/or its subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2019, four of the five joint venture equity options had been exercised by altus to acquire various ownership interests in the associated third-party pipeline limited liability entities.
•   u.s. and north sea divestitures during 2018, apache completed the sale of certain non-core assets, primarily leasehold acreage in the u.s. and north sea regions, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of approximately $138 million.
•   canadian operations on june 30, 2017, apache completed the sale of its canadian assets at midale and house mountain for total cash proceeds of approximately $228 million. in august of 2017, apache completed the sale of its remaining canadian operations for cash proceeds of approximately $478 million, effectively exiting operations in canada.
•   u.s. leasehold divestitures during 2017, apache completed the sale of certain non-core assets, primarily leasehold acreage in the permian and midcontinent/gulf coast regions, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of $798 million.
•   north sea gathering, processing, and transmission (gpt) facility in november 2017, apache completed the sale of its 30.28 percent interest in the scottish area gas evacuation (sage) gas plant and its 60.56 percent interest in the beryl pipeline in the north sea to ancala midstream acquisitions limited for cash proceeds of $134 million.

crude oil prices a substantial portion of our crude oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of the company's control. average realized crude oil prices for 2019 were down 8 percent compared to 2018, a direct result of the decreasing benchmark oil prices over the past year. crude oil prices realized in 2019 averaged $60.05 per barrel.
continued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of our asset portfolio. while the market price received for natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil tends to trade within a global market. price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction.
natural gas prices natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions. our primary markets include north america, egypt, and the u.k. an overview of the market conditions in our primary gas-producing regions follows:
•   north america has a common market. most of the company's gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly or daily index-based prices. the company's u.s. regions averaged $1.26 per mcf in 2019, down from $2.12 per mcf in 2018. current year prices realized by apache were negatively influenced by limited pipeline takeaway capacity from the permian basin that resulted in over supply at various locations in the basin.
•   in egypt, our gas is sold to egyptian general petroleum corporation (egpc), primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale based on dated brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per mmbtu and a maximum of $2.65 per mmbtu,
33
plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. overall, the region averaged $2.83 per mcf in 2019, which remained flat compared with the prior year.
•   natural gas from the north sea beryl field is processed through the sage gas plant. the gas is sold to a third party at the st. fergus entry point of the national grid on a national balancing point index price basis. the region averaged $4.48 per mcf in 2019, a 39 percent decrease from an average of $7.33 per mcf in 2018.
ngl prices apache's u.s. ngl production, which accounts for 96 percent of the company's total 2019 ngl production, is sold under contracts with prices at market indices based on gulf coast supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.
crude oil revenues  crude oil revenues for 2019 totaled $5.2 billion, a $616 million decrease from the 2018 total of $5.8 billion. an 8 percent decrease in average realized prices reduced 2019 revenues by $470 million compared to 2018, while 2 percent lower average daily production decreased revenues by $146 million. average daily production in 2019 was 239.4 mb/d, with prices averaging $60.05 per barrel. crude oil accounted for 83 percent of apache's 2019 oil and gas production revenues and 51 percent of its worldwide production.
worldwide crude oil production decreased 6.0 mb/d compared to 2018, primarily a result of lower gross production in egypt due to natural decline.
natural gas revenues  natural gas revenues for 2019 totaled $678 million, a $241 million decrease from the 2018 total of $919 million. a 27 percent decrease in average realized prices reduced 2019 revenues by $251 million compared to 2018, while 2 percent higher average daily production increased revenues by $10 million. average daily production in 2019 was 980 mmcf/d, with prices averaging $1.90 per mcf. natural gas accounted for 11 percent of apache's 2019 oil and gas production revenues and 34 percent of its worldwide production.
worldwide gas production increased 14.7 mmcf/d compared to 2018, primarily a result of the alpine high development, partially offset by lower gross production in egypt due to natural decline and the sale of the company's woodford-scoop and stack plays and western anadarko basin assets in the u.s.
ngl revenues  ngl revenues for 2019 totaled $407 million, a $176 million decrease from the 2018 total of $583 million. a 41 percent decrease in average realized prices reduced 2019 revenues by $242 million compared to 2018, while 19 percent higher average daily production increased revenues by $66 million. average daily production in 2019 was 71.1 mb/d, with prices averaging $15.74 per barrel. ngls accounted for 6 percent of apache's 2019 oil and gas production revenues and 15 percent of its worldwide production.
worldwide production of ngls increased 11.5 mb/d compared to 2018, primarily a result of the alpine high development and partially offset by the sale of the company's woodford-scoop and stack plays and western anadarko basin assets in the u.s.
altus revenues apache is the largest single owner of the voting common stock of altus and has an approximate 79 percent ownership interest in altus. altus generates revenue primarily by providing fee-based natural gas gathering, compression, processing, and transmission services. altus owns and operates a midstream energy asset network in the permian basin of west texas primarily to service apache's production from its alpine high resource play, which commenced production in may 2017.
during 2019 and 2018, midstream services revenues totaling $136 million and $77 million, respectively, were generated through fee-based contractual arrangements with apache. these affiliated revenues are eliminated upon consolidation. the increase compared to the prior year was primarily driven by higher throughput volumes from apache's drilling activity levels at alpine high in late 2018 and the first half of 2019.
given the prevailing gas and ngl price environment and disappointing performance of multi-well development pads in the second half of 2019, apache materially reduced planned investment and currently has no future drilling plans at alpine high. as such, altus' aggregate gathering and processing volumes from apache are expected to decline over time. other producers developing plays in surrounding areas are expected to provide additional opportunities for altus to pursue third-party treating, processing, and transportation agreements.

lease operating expenses (loe)
loe includes several key components, such as direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, and workover costs. direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.). fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. they directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based. commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as rig rates, labor, boats, helicopters, materials, and supplies. oil, which contributed approximately half of apache's 2019 production, is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties.
during 2019, loe increased $8 million, or 1 percent, on an absolute dollar basis compared to 2018. on a per-unit basis, loe decreased $0.09, or 1 percent, compared to 2018, from $8.47 per boe to $8.38 per boe. loe in the u.s. decreased 10 percent on a per-boe basis, partially offset by localized cost increases in egypt.
gathering, processing, and transmission (gpt)
gpt expenses include processing and transmission costs paid to third-party carriers and to altus for apache's upstream natural gas production associated with its alpine high play. gpt expenses also include midstream operating costs incurred by altus. the following table presents a summary of these expenses:
for the year ended december 31,

total gathering, processing, and transmission          $306                $348                $195
35
gpt costs decreased $42 million from 2018. third-party processing and transmission costs decreased $44 million, primarily driven by a decrease in contracted pricing and the company's sale of non-core assets in oklahoma and texas. midstream operating expenses, incurred primarily by altus, remained relatively flat compared to 2018.
midstream service affiliate costs increased $57 million from 2018. the increase was commensurate with higher throughput volumes from apache's natural gas production at alpine high. these affiliate costs are eliminated upon consolidation.
taxes other than income taxes other than income primarily consist of severance taxes on properties onshore and in state waters off the coast of the u.s. and ad valorem taxes on properties in the u.s. severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues. we are also subject to a variety of other taxes, including u.s. franchise taxes.
taxes other than income totaled $207 million, a decrease of $8 million from 2018, primarily the result of a decrease in severance taxes on lower commodity prices and the divestiture of the company's non-core assets in oklahoma and texas, partially offset by ad valorem taxes on higher production levels and midstream infrastructure in the u.s.
exploration expense exploration expense includes unproved leasehold impairments, exploration dry hole expense, geological and geophysical expense, and the costs of maintaining and retaining unproved leasehold properties. exploration expenses in 2019 increased $302 million compared to 2018. the following table presents a summary of these expenses:
for the year ended december 31,
2019                2018                2017
(in millions)

unproved leasehold impairments increased $405 million compared to 2018. higher leasehold impairments in 2019 were associated with the company's decision to reallocate capital away from planned investment in the alpine high play. dry hole expense decreased $80 million compared to 2018, which is associated with reduced exploration activity when compared to the prior year. exploration overhead decreased $27 million from 2018, primarily a result of a decrease in exploratory activity. the company drilled 31 and 103 gross exploratory wells in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
general and administrative (g&a) expenses g&a expenses decreased $25 million, or 6 percent, from 2018. the decrease in g&a expense was primarily related to lower cash-based stock compensation expense resulting from a decrease in the company's stock price and lower incentive compensation. the prior year periods also reflect a non-recurring charge to accelerate vesting on outstanding stock awards for certain retirement eligible employees.
transaction, reorganization, and separation (trs) costs trs costs totaled $50 million, an increase of $22 million from 2018, primarily the result of severance costs associated with the company's reorganization announced during the fourth quarter of 2019.
apache has historically employed a decentralized, region-focused approach to operations. in recent years, the company has centralized certain operational activities in an effort to capture greater efficiencies through shared services. in light of the continued streamlining of the company's asset portfolio through divestitures and strategic transactions, in late 2019 management initiated a comprehensive redesign of apache's organizational structure and operations that it believes will better position the company to be competitive for the long-term and further reduce recurring costs. the reorganization is ongoing and is expected to be substantially completed for the technical functions by the end of the first quarter of 2020. changes for the corporate support functions will be ongoing through most of 2020.
36
depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&a)
oil and gas property dd&a expense of $2.5 billion in 2019 increased $247 million compared to 2018, primarily a result of a higher depletion rate resulting from negative proved reserve revisions associated with natural gas and ngl pricing. the company's oil and gas property dd&a rate increased $1.22 per boe in 2019 compared to 2018, from $13.33 to $14.55. gpt depreciation increased $22 million in 2019 compared to 2018, associated with capital spending to finalize construction on altus midstream infrastructure.
impairments during 2019, the company recorded asset impairments totaling $2.9 billion in connection with fair value assessments, including $1.5 billion for oil and gas proved properties in the u.s. primarily in alpine high, $1.3 billion impairment of gpt facilities primarily in the altus midstream reporting segment, $149 million on divested unproved properties and leasehold acreage in the western anadarko basin in oklahoma and texas, and $21 million of inventory and other miscellaneous assets, including office leasehold impairments from apache's recent announcement to close its san antonio regional office. the impairments for alpine high and altus midstream were associated with the company's fourth quarter 2019 capital plan allocation decision to materially reduce planned investment in the alpine high play.
during 2018, the company recorded asset impairments totaling $511 million in connection with fair value assessments, including $328 million for oil and gas proved properties in the u.s. and egypt, $56 million impairment of a gathering and processing facility in oklahoma, $113 million for the impairment of an equity method investment based on a negotiated sales price, a $10 million impairment on the carrying values of capitalized exploratory well costs related to the sale of unproved properties in the north sea, and $4 million for inventory write-downs.
the following table presents a summary of asset impairments recorded for 2019, 2018, and 2017:

net financing costs decreased $16 million from 2018. the decrease is primarily related to lower interest expense and a smaller loss recognized from the extinguishment of debt in two separate debt tender offer transactions occurring during 2019 and 2018 as further discussed below under "capital resources and liquidity." interest income in 2019 decreased $9 million compared to the prior year on lower average cash balances held by the company.
37
provision for income taxes income tax expense in 2019 totaled $674 million. during 2019, apache's effective tax rate was impacted primarily by an increase in the amount of valuation allowance against the company's u.s. deferred tax assets. income tax expense in 2018 totaled $672 million. during 2018, apache's effective tax rate was impacted primarily by the adjustment to the provision amounts recorded in 2017 related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act (the tcja) and an increase in the company's valuation allowance.
on december 22, 2017, the tcja was signed into law. in addition to reducing the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective january 1, 2018, certain provisions in the tcja move the u.s. away from a worldwide tax system and closer to a territorial system for earnings of foreign corporations, establishing a participation exemption system for taxation of foreign income. the new law includes a transition rule to effect this participation exemption regime. as a result of the enacted legislation, taxpayers were required to include in taxable income for the tax year ending december 31, 2017, the pro rata share of deferred income of each specified foreign corporation with respect to which the taxpayer is a u.s. shareholder. in 2017, the company recorded a $419 million provisional deferred tax expense attributable to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings required under the tcja.
also on december 22, 2017, the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118 (sab 118), which provides guidance for the application of accounting standards codification (asc) topic 740, income taxes, for the income tax effects of the tcja. sab 118 provides a measurement period which should not extend beyond one year of the enactment date of the tcja. in 2018, the company recorded an additional $103 million deferred tax expense attributable to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. this deferred tax expense combined with the provisional amount recorded in 2017 were fully offset by available foreign tax credits. the company completed its analysis of the income tax effects of the tcja in the fourth quarter of 2018.
apache recorded a full valuation allowance against its u.s. net deferred tax assets. apache will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on its u.s. net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of this allowance.
for additional information regarding income taxes, please refer to note 10-income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
38
capital and operational outlook apache's strategic approach and multi-year outlook emphasizes retaining cash flow in excess of the company's dividend payments, reducing outstanding debt, prioritizing long-term returns over growth, aggressively managing its cost structure, and advancing exploration and appraisal activities in suriname. apache's differentiated asset portfolio and continued capital allocation discipline will drive these efforts. apache currently plans to invest $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion in its upstream oil and gas activities in 2020, assuming wti pricing of approximately $50 per barrel. in terms of capital allocation, alpine high will receive minimal to no funding, and some capital will be shifted from permian oil projects to our egypt region. based on current plan projections, for 2020, the company expects to:
•   maintain its current dividend;
•   retain cash flow to initiate progress on debt reduction goals;
•   allocate approximately $200 million to exploration; and
•   achieve flat-to-low single-digit corporate oil production growth, year-over-year.
to the extent wti pricing continues to fall, capital investment will be reduced, as will near-term production outlooks. however, if oil prices move materially higher, the company will prioritize further debt reduction over increasing capital activity. apache also continues cost management efforts, centralizing the organization and emphasizing incentives directly related to specific asset performance rather than a region focus. the company expects to achieve at least $150 million of annual savings from overhead and operating cost reductions associated with this initiative.
separate from the company's upstream oil and gas activities, altus will primarily direct capital spending toward its equity method interests in four permian basin long-haul pipeline entities, which include the following equity interest ownership stakes:
•   16 percent in the gulf coast express natural gas pipeline (gcx);
•   15 percent in the epic crude pipeline (epic);
•   26.7 percent in the permian highway natural gas pipeline (php); and
•   33 percent in the shin oak ngl pipeline (shin oak).
epic is installing additional operational storage capacity and completing an additional dock, and php is still under construction. the company estimates that altus, based on its equity interests in each pipeline, will incur approximately $300 million of additional capital contributions associated with the remaining construction costs in these joint venture pipelines during 2020. infrastructure build-out for altus' gpt assets was substantially completed during 2019, and capital investment for its gpt assets in 2020 is expected to be limited.
capital resources and liquidity operating cash flows are the company's primary source of liquidity. apache's operating cash flows, both in the short-term and the long-term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices, as well as costs and sales volumes. significant changes in commodity prices impact apache's revenues, earnings and cash flows. these changes potentially impact apache's liquidity if costs do not trend with changes in commodity prices. historically, costs have trended with commodity prices, albeit on a lag. sales volumes also impact cash flows; however, they have a less volatile impact in the short term.
apache's long-term operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing operations. cash investments are required to fund activity necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent on the success of apache's drilling program and its ability to add reserves economically. changes in commodity prices also impact estimated quantities of proved reserves. in the year ended 2019, apache recognized negative reserve revisions of approximately 11 percent of its year-end 2018 estimated proved reserves as a result of lower prices. if prices for 2020 approximate commodity future prices as of december 31, 2019, the company is not reasonably likely to report additional negative revisions.
at times, the company may also elect to utilize available cash on hand, committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs.
apache believes the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to the company, combined with proactive measures to adjust its capital budget to reflect volatile commodity prices and anticipated operating cash flows, will be adequate to fund short-

term and long-term operations, including apache's capital development program, repayment of debt maturities, payment of dividends, and any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with commitments and contingencies.

(1)   the table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, the amounts may differ from those discussed elsewhere in this document, which include accruals.
sources of cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities operating cash flows are the company's primary source of capital and liquidity and are impacted, both in the short term and the long term, by volatile oil and natural gas prices. the factors that determine operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as dd&a, asset retirement obligation (aro) accretion, exploratory dry hole expense, asset impairments, and deferred income tax expense.
net cash provided by operating activities for 2019 totaled $2.9 billion, down $910 million from 2018. the decrease primarily reflects lower commodity prices during 2019 compared to 2018.
for a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, and expenses, please see "results of operations" in this item 7. for additional detail on the changes in operating assets and liabilities and the non-cash expenses that do not impact net cash provided by operating activities, please see the statement of consolidated cash flows in the consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.

cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2019, apache had $247 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $6 million was held by altus. the majority of the cash is invested in highly liquid, investment-grade instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
debt at december 31, 2019, outstanding debt, which consisted of notes, debentures, subsidiary credit facility borrowings, and finance lease obligations, totaled $8.6 billion, of which approximately $406 million was related to altus. current debt as of december 31, 2019, included $11 million for finance lease obligations, of which $10 million was related to altus.
available credit facilities in march 2018, the company entered into a revolving credit facility with commitments totaling $4.0 billion. in march 2019, the term of this facility was extended by one year to march 2024 (subject to apache's remaining one-year extension option) pursuant to apache's exercise of an extension option. the company can increase commitments up to $5.0 billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. the facility includes a letter of credit subfacility of up to $3.0 billion, of which $2.08 billion was committed as of december 31, 2019. the facility is for general corporate purposes and committed borrowing capacity fully supports apache's commercial paper program. letters of credit are available for security needs, including in respect of abandonment obligations assumed in various north sea acquisitions. as of december 31, 2019, there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under this facility.
at apache's option, the interest rate per annum for borrowings under the 2018 facility is either a base rate, as defined, plus a margin, or the london inter-bank offered rate (libor), plus a margin. apache also pays quarterly a facility fee at a per annum rate on total commitments. the margins and the facility fee vary based upon apache's senior long-term debt rating. at december 31, 2019, the base rate margin was 0.075 percent, the libor margin was 1.075 percent, and the facility fee was 0.175 percent. a commission is payable quarterly to lenders on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit at a per annum rate equal to the libor margin then in effect. customary letter of credit fronting fees and other charges are payable to issuing banks.
the financial covenants of the 2018 credit facility require apache to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. for purposes of this calculation, capital excludes the effects of non-cash write-downs, impairments, and related charges occurring after june 30, 2015. at december 31, 2019, apache's debt-to-capital ratio as calculated under the credit facility was 31 percent.
the 2018 facility's negative covenants restrict the ability of apache and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on their hydrocarbon-related assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry; liens securing debt incurred to finance the acquisition, construction, improvement, or capital lease of assets, provided that such debt, when incurred, does not exceed the subject purchase price and costs, as applicable, and related expenses; liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the united states and canada; and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics' liens. apache also may incur liens on assets if debt secured thereby does not exceed 15 percent of apache's consolidated net tangible assets, or approximately $2.4 billion as of december 31, 2019. negative covenants also restrict apache's ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, dispose of substantially all of its assets, and guarantee debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.
in november 2018, altus midstream lp entered into a revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes that matures in november 2023 (subject to altus midstream lp's two, one-year extension options). the agreement for this facility, as amended, provides aggregate commitments from a syndicate of banks of $800 million. all aggregate commitments include a letter of credit subfacility of up to $100 million and a swingline loan subfacility of up to $100 million. altus midstream lp may increase commitments up to an aggregate $1.5 billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. as of december 31, 2019, there were $396 million of borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under this facility.
the agreement for altus midstream lp's credit facility, as amended, restricts distributions in respect of capital to apache and other unit holders in certain circumstances. unless the leverage ratio is less than or equal to 4.00:1.00, the agreement limits such distributions to $30 million per calendar year until either (i) the consolidated net income of altus midstream lp and its restricted subsidiaries, as adjusted pursuant to the agreement, for three consecutive calendar months equals or exceeds $350.0 million on an annualized basis or (ii) altus midstream lp has a specified senior long-term debt rating; in addition, before the occurrence of one of those two events, the leverage ratio must be less than or equal to 5.00:1.00. in no event can any distribution be made that would, after giving effect to it on a pro forma basis, result in a leverage ratio greater than (i) 5.00:1.00 or (ii) for a specified period after a qualifying acquisition, 5.50:1.00. the leverage ratio is the ratio of (1) the consolidated indebtedness of
43
altus midstream lp and its restricted subsidiaries to (2) ebitda (as defined in the agreement) of altus midstream lp and its restricted subsidiaries for the 12-month period ending immediately before the determination date. the leverage ratio as of december 31, 2019 was less than 4.00:1.00.
the terms of altus midstream lp's series a cumulative redeemable preferred units also contain certain restrictions on distributions in respect of capital, including the common units held by apache and any other units that rank junior to the preferred units with respect to distributions or distributions upon liquidation. refer to note 13-redeemable noncontrolling interest - altus for further information. in addition, the amount of any cash distributions to altus midstream lp by any entity in which it has an interest accounted for by the equity method is subject to such entity's compliance with the terms of any debt or other agreements by which it may be bound, which in turn may impact the amount of funds available for distribution by altus midstream lp to its partners.
the altus midstream lp credit facility is unsecured and is not guaranteed by apache or any of apache's other subsidiaries.
there are no clauses in either the agreement for apache's 2018 credit facility or for altus midstream lp's 2018 credit facility that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes. these agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. however, each agreement allows the lenders to accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches, and if a borrower or any of its subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, is insolvent, or has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold. lenders may also accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments under the applicable agreement if apache or altus midstream lp, as applicable, undergoes a specified change in control or any borrower has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold. each of apache and altus midstream lp was in compliance with the terms of its 2018 credit facility as of december 31, 2019.
there is no assurance that the financial condition of banks with lending commitments to apache or altus midstream lp will not deteriorate. we closely monitor the ratings of the banks in our bank groups. having large bank groups allows the company to mitigate the potential impact of any bank's failure to honor its lending commitment.
commercial paper program as of december 31, 2019, apache has available a $3.5 billion commercial paper program which, subject to market availability, facilitates apache borrowing funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. the commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under apache's 2018 $4.0 billion committed credit facility. if apache is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, apache's 2018 committed credit facility, which matures in 2024, is available as a 100 percent backstop. as of december 31, 2019, apache had no borrowings under its commercial paper program.
off-balance sheet arrangements apache enters into customary agreements in the oil and gas industry for drilling rig commitments, firm transportation agreements, and other obligations as described below in "contractual obligations" in this item 7. other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described herein, apache does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or capital resource positions.

(1)   includes outstanding principal amounts at december 31, 2019. this table does not include future commitment fees, interest expense, or other fees on altus' credit facility because they are floating rate instruments, and management cannot determine with accuracy the timing of future loan advances, repayments, or future interest rates to be charged.
(2)   amounts represent the company's undiscounted finance lease obligation related to physical power generators being leased on a one-year term with the right to purchase and a separate lease for the company's midland, texas regional office building.
(3)   amounts represent future lease payments associated with oil and gas operations inclusive of amounts billable to partners and other working interest owners. such payments may be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties and subsequently depreciated, impaired, or written off as exploration expense.
(4)   amounts represent any agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. these include minimum commitments associated with take-or-pay contracts, ngl processing agreements, drilling work program commitments, and agreements to secure capacity rights on third-party pipelines. amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing and trading activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable. total costs incurred under take-or-pay and throughput obligations were $111 million, $132 million, and $134 million for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
(5)   subsequent to december 31, 2019, apache entered into an agreement to assign approximately $171 million of its firm transportation obligations beginning in march 2020.
(6)   this table does not include the company's liability for dismantlement, abandonment, and restoration costs of oil and gas properties or pension or postretirement benefit obligations. for additional information regarding these liabilities, please see notes 8 and 12, respectively, in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
as further described above under "capital and operational outlook," altus midstream lp and/or its subsidiaries have exercised four of the five options to acquire equity interests in third-party joint venture pipelines. upon exercising each individual option, altus midstream lp and/or its subsidiaries may be required to fund future capital expenditures for its equity interest share in the development of the applicable pipeline. epic is installing additional operational storage capacity and completing an additional dock, and php is still under construction. the company estimates that altus, based on its equity interests in each pipeline, will incur approximately $300 million of additional capital contributions associated with the remaining construction costs in these joint venture pipelines during 2020.
apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. the inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. apache's management believes that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations, including approximately $2 million for environmental remediation and approximately $21 million for various contingent legal liabilities. for a detailed discussion of the company's environmental and legal contingencies, please see note 11-commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.

in addition, the company has potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties. apache has divested various leases, wells, and facilities located in the gulf of mexico where the purchasers typically assume all obligations to plug, abandon, and decommission the associated wells, structures, and facilities acquired. one or more of the counterparties in these transactions could, either as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses, face financial problems that may have a significant impact on their solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. if a purchaser of our gulf of mexico assets becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or otherwise fails to perform required abandonment obligations, apache could be required to perform such actions under applicable federal laws and regulations. in such event, apache may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.
with respect to oil and gas operations in the gulf of mexico, the bureau of ocean energy management (boem) has issued a notice to lessees (ntl no. 2016-n01) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the gulf of mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies' oil and gas leases. while requirements under the ntl have not yet been fully implemented by boem, the ntl will likely require that apache provide additional security to boem with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to apache's current ownership interests in various gulf of mexico leases. we are working closely with boem to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security becomes necessary under the ntl. additionally, we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which apache has sold gulf of mexico assets or with whom apache has joint ownership. such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties' solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.
insurance program we maintain insurance policies that include coverage for physical damage to our assets, general liabilities, workers' compensation, employers' liability, sudden and accidental pollution, and other risks. our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles or retentions that we must satisfy prior to recovering on insurance. additionally, our insurance is subject to policy exclusions and limitations. there is no assurance that insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. further we do not have coverage in place for a variety of other risks including gulf of mexico named windstorm and business interruption.
our current insurance policies covering physical damage to our assets provide up to $1 billion in coverage per occurrence. these policies also provide sudden and accidental pollution coverage.
our current insurance policies covering general liabilities provide $500 million in coverage, scaled to apache's interest. our service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify apache for injuries and death of the service provider's employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service provider.
apache purchases multi-year political risk insurance from the overseas private investment corporation (opic) and highly-rated insurers covering a portion of its investments in egypt for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks. the islamic corporation for the insurance of investment and export credit (iciec, an agency of the islamic development bank) reinsures opic. in the aggregate, these insurance policies provide up to $750 million of coverage to apache, subject to policy terms and conditions and a retention of approximately $1 billion.
apache has an additional insurance policy with opic, which, subject to policy terms and conditions, provides up to $300 million of coverage through 2024 for losses arising from (1) non-payment by egpc of arbitral awards covering amounts owed apache on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of egypt prevent apache from exporting our share of production. the multilateral investment guarantee agency (miga), a member of the world bank group, provides $150 million in reinsurance to opic.
future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. in addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable or unavailable on terms economically acceptable.
critical accounting policies and estimates apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. apache identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of apache's financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. critical accounting policies cover accounting
46
matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. management routinely discusses the development, selection, and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. the following is a discussion of apache's most critical accounting policies.
reserves estimates proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations.
proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time.
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. for example, since we use the units-of-production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd&a expense. a material adverse change in the estimated volumes of reserves could result in property impairments. finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures.
reserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation.
apache has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing.
oil and gas exploration costs apache accounts for its exploration and production activities using the successful efforts method of accounting. costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage are capitalized. costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are also capitalized. oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found. on a quarterly basis, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory well costs in light of ongoing exploration activities and determines whether the company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. if management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the statement of consolidated operations. otherwise, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
long-lived asset impairments long-lived assets used in operations, including proved oil and gas properties and gpt assets, are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset. individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. if there is an indication that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recovered, the asset is assessed by management through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes, and future development plans are reviewed. if, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is assessed by management using the income approach.
47
under the income approach, the fair value of each asset group is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows. the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs, proved reserves, the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves, expected throughput volumes for gpt assets, discount rates, and other variables. key assumptions used in developing a discounted cash flow model described above include estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves; estimates of market prices considering forward commodity price curves as of the measurement date; and estimates of operating, administrative, and capital costs adjusted for inflation. we discount the resulting future cash flows using a discount rate believed to be consistent with those applied by market participants.
to assess the reasonableness of our fair value estimate, when available we use a market approach to compare the fair value to similar assets. this requires management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable assets, recent comparable asset transactions, and transaction premiums.
although we base the fair value estimate of each asset group on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, and actual results could differ from the estimate. negative revisions of estimated reserves quantities, increases in future cost estimates, divestiture of a significant component of the asset group, or sustained decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices could lead to a reduction in expected future cash flows and possibly an additional impairment of long-lived assets in future periods.
over the past several years, the company has experienced substantial volatility in commodity prices, which impacted our future development plans and operating cash flows. as such, we recorded impairments of certain proved oil and gas properties and gathering, processing, and transmission facilities in 2019 and 2018. for discussion of these impairments, see "fair value measurements" of note 1-summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
asset retirement obligation (aro)
the company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. apache's removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the north sea and gulf of mexico. estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments. asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety, and public relations considerations.
aro associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. the liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. the aro liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with apache's oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets. the company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.
income taxes our oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. we routinely assess the ability to realize our deferred tax assets. if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).
the company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the company operates. the company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. these accruals for uncertain tax positions are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and any new legislation. the company believes that its accruals for uncertain tax positions are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments.

item 1a. risk factors.
investing in our securities involves risk. in addition to the other information contained in this report, you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities.
risks related to our business there has been a shift in consumer behavior as a result of technological innovations and changes in the distribution of content, which may affect our viewership and the profitability of our business in unpredictable ways.
technology and business models in our industry continue to evolve rapidly. changes to these business models include (a) the presence of streaming services, which are increasing in number and some of which have a significant and growing subscriber base, and (b) the increased video consumption through subscription steaming services and time-delayed or time-shifted viewing of television programming through on-demand services and dvrs. consumer behavior related to changes in content distribution and technological innovation affect our economic model and viewership in ways that are not entirely predictable.
consumers are increasingly viewing content on a time-delayed or on-demand basis from traditional distributors and from streaming services, connected apps and websites and on a wide variety of screens, such as televisions, tablets, mobile phones and other devices. additionally, devices that allow users to view television programs on a time-shifted basis and technologies that enable users to fast-forward or skip programming, including commercials, such as dvrs and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to store or make portable copies of content may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenues. there is increased demand for short-form, user-generated and interactive content, which have different economic models than our traditional content offerings. likewise, distributors are offering smaller programming packages known as "skinny bundles," which are delivered at a lower cost than traditional offerings and sometimes allow consumers to create a customized package of networks, that are gaining popularity among consumers. if our networks are not included in these packages or consumers favor alternative offerings, we may experience a decline in viewership and ultimately the demand for our programming, which could lead to lower distribution and advertising revenues. we have also seen declines in subscribers to the traditional cable bundle. in 2019, total u.s. networks portfolio subscribers declined 5% while subscribers to our fully distributed networks declined 3%. in order to respond to changes in content distribution models in our industry, we have invested in, developed and launched dtc products including food network kitchen, dplay, joyn, motortrend and others. there can be no assurance, however, that our viewers will respond to our dtc products or that our dtc strategy will be successful, particularly given the increase in dtc products on the market. each distribution model has different risks and economic consequences for us, so the rapid evolution of consumer preferences may have an economic impact that is not completely predictable. distribution windows are also evolving, potentially affecting revenues from other windows. if we cannot ensure that our distribution methods and content are responsive to our target audiences, our business could be adversely affected.
consolidation among cable and satellite providers, both domestically and internationally, could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.
consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators considerable leverage in their relationships with programmers, including us. in the u.s., approximately 95% of our distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors. we currently have agreements in place with the major cable and satellite operators in u.s. networks and international networks which expire at various times through 2024. some of our largest distributors have combined, and as a result, have gained, or may gain, market power, which could affect our ability to maximize the value of our content through those platforms. in addition, many of the countries and territories in which we distribute our networks also have a small number of dominant distributors. continued consolidation within the industry could reduce the number of distributors to carry our programming, subject our affiliate fee revenue to greater volume discounts, and further increase the negotiating leverage of the cable and satellite television system operators which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
the success of our business depends on the acceptance of our entertainment and sports content by our u.s. and foreign viewers, which may be unpredictable and volatile.
the production and distribution of entertainment and sports content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content that meets the changing preferences of viewers in general, in special interest groups, in specific demographic categories and in various international marketplaces. as the home of the olympic games in europe until 2024, we have been developing and innovating new forms of content in connection with the olympic games. our success with the olympics depends on audience acceptance of this content. if viewers do not find our olympic games content acceptable, we could see low viewership, which could lead to low distribution and advertising revenues. the success of our partnership with the pga tour, which runs through 2031, is similarly dependent on audience acceptance and viewership. failing to gain the level of audience acceptance we expect for the pga tour content may negatively impact our distribution and advertising revenues over the period of the partnership.
the commercial success of our content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing content available in the applicable marketplace. other factors, including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions, piracy, and growing competition for consumer discretionary spending may also affect the audience for our content. audience sizes for our media networks are critical factors affecting both the volume and pricing of advertising revenue that we receive, and the extent of distribution and the license fees we receive under agreements with our distributors. consequently, reduced public acceptance of our entertainment content may decrease our audience share and adversely affect our results of operations.
as a company that has operations in the united kingdom, the vote by the united kingdom to leave the e.u. could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial position.
on june 23, 2016, the u.k. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the e.u., commonly referred to as "brexit." as a result of the referendum, the british government has negotiated the terms of the u.k.'s formal departure from the e.u. after several delays, the u.k. formally left the e.u. on january 31, 2020. the formal departure includes a transitional period until december 31, 2020, during which the current rights and obligations on trade, travel and business for the u.k. and e.u. will continue to apply. the future relationship between the u.k. and the e.u. remains to be negotiated. negotiations will start shortly and are intended to produce a free trade deal by december 31, 2020.
there is still considerable political uncertainty around the outcome of brexit. the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the u.k. makes to retain access to the e.u. markets beyond the transitional period. the measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose subscribers, distributors and employees. if the u.k. loses access to the single e.u. market, it could have a detrimental impact on our u.k. growth. such a decline could also make our doing business in europe more complex, which could involve operational changes in order to protect, delay and reduce the scope of our distribution and licensing agreements. without access to the single e.u. market, it may be more challenging and costly to obtain intellectual property rights for our content within the u.k., distribute our services in europe or to launch new dtc services.
in addition, brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the u.k. determines which e.u. laws to replace and/or replicate. if there are changes to u.k. immigration policy as a result of brexit, this could affect our employees and their ability to move freely between the e.u. member states for work-related matters.
the announcement of brexit has caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations. with the expansion of our international operations, our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuation has increased. this increase in exposure could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and net asset balances, as there can be no assurance that the downward trend of the british pound and the euro will rebound. brexit may also create global uncertainty, which may cause a decrease in consumer discretionary spending. decreases in consumer discretionary spending may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions where our networks are distributed. a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming could have a negative impact on our distribution revenues and the rates we are able to charge for advertising. in addition, different market requirements for advertising content may impact our advertising revenues. any of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial position.
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions.
we have significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of our operations are conducted and certain of our debt obligations are denominated in foreign currencies. as a result, we have exposure to foreign currency risk as we enter into transactions and make investments denominated in multiple currencies. the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the u.s. dollar. our consolidated financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the u.s. from local currencies into u.s. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. as we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. this increased exposure could have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net asset balances. there is no assurance that downward trending currencies will rebound or that stable currencies will remain unchanged in any period or for any specific market.
our businesses operate in highly competitive industries.
the entertainment and media programming industries in which we operate are highly competitive. we compete with other programming networks for distribution, viewers and advertising. we face increased competition from subscription based streaming services and dtc offerings and we also compete for viewers with other forms of media entertainment, such as home video, movies, periodicals, on-line and mobile activities. in particular, websites and search engines have seen significant advertising growth, a portion of which has moved from traditional cable network and satellite advertisers. businesses, including ours, that offer multiple services, or that may be vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming content, may face closer regulatory review from the competition authorities in the countries in which we currently have operations. if our distributors have to pay higher rates to holders of sports broadcasting rights, it might be difficult for us to negotiate higher rates for distribution of our networks. the ability of our businesses to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including our ability to consistently supply high quality and popular content, access our niche viewership with appealing category-specific content, adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms and achieve widespread distribution. there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that increasing competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
failure to renew, renewal with less favorable terms, or termination of our distribution agreements may cause a decline in our revenue.
because our networks are licensed on a wholesale basis to distributors, such as cable and satellite operators, which in turn distribute them to consumers, we are dependent upon the maintenance of distribution agreements with these operators. these distribution agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive, such as channel placement and programming package inclusion (widely distributed, broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed, specialized programming packages) and for payment of a license fee to us based on the number of subscribers that receive our networks.
while the number of subscribers associated with our networks impacts our ability to generate advertising revenue, these per subscriber payments also represent a significant portion of our revenue. our distribution agreements generally have a limited term which varies by market and distributor, and there can be no assurance that these distribution agreements will be renewed in the future or renewed on terms that are favorable to us. a reduction in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid, including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks, could adversely affect our distribution revenue. such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue. in addition, our distribution agreements are complex and individually negotiated. if we were to disagree with one of our counterparties on the interpretation of a distribution agreement, our relationship with that counterparty could be damaged and our business could be negatively affected.
interpretation of some terms of our distribution agreements may have an adverse effect on the distribution payments we receive under those agreements.
some of our distribution agreements contain "most favored nation" clauses. these clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another distributor which contains certain more favorable terms, we must offer some of those terms to our existing distributors. we have entered into a number of distribution agreements with terms that differ in some respects from those contained in other agreements. while we believe that we have appropriately complied with the most favored nation clauses included in our distribution agreements, these agreements are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that, if correct, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
we face cybersecurity and similar risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, disruption of our programming services, damage to our brands and reputation, legal exposure and financial losses.
our on-line, mobile and app offerings, as well as our internal systems, involve the storage and transmission of personal and proprietary information, and we and our partners rely on various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming. from time to time, hackers continue to target discovery and our systems may be breached due to employee error, malicious code, hacking and phishing attacks, or otherwise. additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data and systems. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures, notwithstanding our ongoing efforts to develop and implement robust data security tools, practices, and protocols. any such breach or unauthorized access could result in a loss of our proprietary information, which may include user data, a disruption of our services or a reduction of the revenues we are able to generate from such services, damage to our brands and reputation, a loss of confidence in the security of our offerings and services, and significant legal and financial exposure, each of which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate us for losses associated with network security and privacy events.
in addition, we face regulatory risk associated with the acquisition, storage, disclosure, use and protection of personal data, including under the european union general data protection regulation ("gdpr"), the california consumer privacy act ("ccpa"), and various other domestic and international privacy and data security laws and regulations, which are continually evolving. these evolving data protection laws may require discovery to expend significant resources to implement additional data protection measures, and discovery's actual or alleged failure to comply with such laws could result in legal claims, regulatory enforcement actions and significant fines and penalties.
financial performance for our equity method investments and investments without readily determinable fair value may differ from current estimates.
we have equity investments in several entities and the accounting treatment applied for these investments varies depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our percentage ownership and the level of influence or control we have over the relevant entity. any losses experienced by these entities could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our investment. in addition, if these entities were to fail and cease operations, we may lose the entire value of our investment and the stream of any shared profits. some of our ventures may require additional uncommitted funding. we also have significant investments in entities that we have accounted for as investments without readily determinable fair value. if these entities experience significant losses or were to fail and cease operations, our investments could be subject to impairment and the loss of a part or all of our investment value.
our ongoing efforts to integrate the scripps networks business with our own may not yield the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or we may be unable to manage our expanded operations, either of which would adversely affect our results of operations.
we have devoted, and expect to continue to devote, significant management attention and resources to integrating our organization, procedures, and operations with those of scripps networks. such integration efforts are costly due to the large number of processes, policies, procedures, locations, operations, technologies and systems to be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, service, operations, payroll, pricing, marketing and employee benefits. integration expenses could, particularly in the short term, exceed the cost synergies we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale, which could result in significant charges to earnings that we cannot currently quantify. potential difficulties that we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:
•   our inability to successfully combine our business with scripps networks in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the full synergies and other benefits anticipated to result from the merger; and
•   complexities associated with managing the combined businesses, including difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating products, services, complex and different information technology systems, control and compliance processes, technology, networks and other assets of each of the companies in a cohesive manner.
following the merger, the size and complexity of the business of the combined company increased significantly. our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected synergies and benefits anticipated from the merger.
general risks theft of our content, including digital copyright theft and other unauthorized exhibitions of our content, may decrease revenue received from our programming and adversely affect our businesses and profitability.
the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain the intellectual property rights to our entertainment content. we are fundamentally a content company, and piracy of our brands, television networks, digital content and other intellectual property has the potential to significantly and adversely affect us. piracy is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack copyright and other protections similar to existing law in the u.s. it is also made easier by technological advances allowing the conversion of content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners' ability to protect and exploit their property. the proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have an adverse effect on our business and profitability because it reduces the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content. litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of proprietary rights claimed by others.
we are subject to risks related to our international operations.
we have operations through which we distribute programming outside the united states. as a result, our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business, many of which are beyond our control. these risks include:
•   laws and policies affecting trade and taxes, including laws and policies relating to the repatriation of funds and withholding taxes, and changes in these laws;
•   changes in local regulatory requirements, including restrictions on content, imposition of local content quotas and restrictions on foreign ownership;
•   differing degrees of protection for intellectual property and varying attitudes towards the piracy of intellectual property;
•   significant fluctuations in foreign currency value;
•   currency exchange controls;
•   the instability of foreign economies and governments;
•   war and acts of terrorism;
•   anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations and changes in these laws and regulations;
•   foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulation and changes in these laws; and
•   shifting consumer preferences regarding the viewing of video programming.
events or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenues from non-u.s. sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects. furthermore, some foreign markets where we and our partners operate may be more adversely affected by current economic conditions than the u.s. we also may incur substantial expense as a result of changes, including the imposition of new restrictions, in the existing economic or political environment in the regions where we do business. acts of terrorism, hostilities, or financial, political, economic or other uncertainties could lead to a reduction in revenue or loss of investment, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our business.
our business is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions and by disruptions to financial markets. we derive substantial revenues from advertisers, and these expenditures are sensitive to general economic conditions and consumer buying patterns. financial instability or a general decline in economic conditions in the u.s. and other countries where our networks are distributed could adversely affect advertising rates and volume, resulting in a decrease in our advertising revenues.
decreases in consumer discretionary spending in the u.s. and other countries where our networks are distributed may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions, in particular with respect to digital service tiers on which certain of our programming networks are carried. this could lead to a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming from multi-channel video programming distributors, which could have a negative impact on our viewing subscribers and distribution revenues. similarly, a decrease in viewing subscribers would also have a negative impact on the number of viewers actually watching the programs on our programming networks, which could also impact the rates we are able to charge advertisers.
economic conditions affect a number of aspects of our businesses worldwide and impact the businesses of our partners who purchase advertising on our networks and might reduce their spending on advertising. economic conditions can also negatively affect the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. the general worsening of current global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, and the worsening of economic conditions in certain parts of the world, specifically, could impact the expansion and success of our businesses in such areas.
domestic and foreign laws and regulations could adversely impact our operation results.
programming services like ours, and the distributors of our services, including cable operators, satellite operators and other multi-channel video programming distributors, are regulated by u.s. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the fcc, as well as by state and local governments, in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video content business. see the discussion under "business - regulatory matters" above. the u.s. congress, the fcc and the courts currently have under consideration, and may adopt or interpret in the future, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operations of our u.s. media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate.
similarly, the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have, in varying degrees, laws and regulations governing our businesses. programming businesses are subject to regulation on a country-by-country basis. changes in regulations imposed by foreign governments could also adversely affect our business, results of operations and ability to expand our operations beyond their current scope.
financial markets are subject to volatility and disruptions that may affect our ability to obtain or increase the cost of financing our operations and our ability to meet our other obligations.
increased volatility and disruptions in the u.s. and global financial and equity markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing. our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a low rating could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing. unforeseeable changes in foreign currencies could negatively impact our results of operations and calculations of interest coverage and leverage ratios.
acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction.
from time to time we make acquisitions, investments and enter into other strategic transactions, including the transaction with scripps networks. in connection with such acquisitions and strategic transactions, we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, subscribers, affiliates and vendors, incur significant debt, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions. additionally, regulatory agencies, such as the fcc or u.s. department of justice may impose additional restrictions on the operation of our business as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic transactions. the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business.
our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses, assets, products or technologies could harm our operating results.
our success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. we have acquired, and have made strategic investments in, a number of companies (including through joint ventures) in the past, and we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future. such transactions may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, use of our cash resources, and incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. any acquisitions and strategic investments that we are able to identify and complete may be accompanied by a number of risks, including:
•   the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our operations;
•   the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;
•   the incurrence of additional operating losses and operating expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;
•   the difficulty of integrating acquired technology and rights into our services and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;
•   the failure to successfully further develop an acquired business or technology and any resulting impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets;
•   the failure of strategic investments to perform as expected or to meet financial projections;
•   the potential for patent and trademark infringement and data privacy and security claims against the acquired companies, or companies in which we have invested;
•   litigation or other claims in connection with acquisitions, acquired companies, or companies in which we have invested;
•   the impairment or loss of relationships with customers and partners of the companies we acquired or in which we invested or with our customers and partners as a result of the integration of acquired operations;
•   the impairment of relationships with, or failure to retain, employees of acquired companies or our existing employees as a result of integration of new personnel;
•   our lack of, or limitations on our, control over the operations of our joint venture companies;
•   the difficulty of integrating operations, systems, and controls as a result of cultural, regulatory, systems, and operational differences;
•   in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments, the impact of particular economic, tax, currency, political, legal and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and
•   the impact of known potential liabilities or liabilities that may be unknown, including as a result of inadequate internal controls, associated with the companies we acquired or in which we invested.
our failure to be successful in addressing these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and strategic investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.
the loss of key personnel or talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our revenue.
our business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities. with respect to the scripps networks acquisition, our success depends in part upon our ability to retain key employees. following the completion of a merger, like the scripps acquisition, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with discovery and choose to pursue other opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on discovery. if key employees depart, the integration of scripps networks with discovery may be more difficult and our business may be adversely affected. additionally, we employ or contract with entertainment personalities who may have loyal audiences. these individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content. there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences. if we fail to retain key individuals or if our entertainment personalities lose their current audience base, our operations could be adversely affected.
increasing complexity of global tax policy and regulations could adversely impact our international business and results of operations.
we continue to face the increasing complexity of operating in multiple non-u.s. jurisdictions, many of which have increased scrutiny and have either changed, or plan to change, their international tax systems due to the organisation for economic co-operation and development's ("oecd") base erosion and profit shifting ("beps") recommendations. the beps recommendations call for enhanced transparency and reporting relating to companies' entity structures and transfer pricing policies. these have been implemented through various initiatives including the requirement for taxpayers to comply with global country-by-country reporting and the filing of a global master file as well as the introduction of the multilateral instrument ("mli") which allows taxing authorities to better take aim at multinational tax avoidance. we continue to address and comply with these compliance and reporting requirements.
additional complexity has also arisen in state aid: state resources used to provide recipients an advantage on a selective basis that has or could distort competition and affect trade between european member states. in recent years the european commission ("ec") has increased their scrutiny on state aid and deviated from the historical e.u. state aid practices. there is great uncertainty about the future of e.u. state aid practices based on the appeals of many significant ec rulings against multinational corporations that are currently being challenged. while any potential impact of these rulings is difficult to assess, we believe our transfer pricing analyses conducted pursuant to accepted oecd methodologies assist in mitigating risk associated with our past or current agreements.
in addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. our income taxes could also be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.
risks related to our debt we have a significant amount of debt and may incur significant amounts of additional debt, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business.
as of december 31, 2019, we had approximately $15.4 billion of consolidated debt, of which $609 million is current. our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, interest on, or other amounts associated with our indebtedness. in addition, we have the ability to draw down our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility in the ordinary course, which would have the effect of increasing our indebtedness. we are also permitted, subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, to obtain additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs. this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.
our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations, including:
•   impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt in the event that an uncured default occurs;
•   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and market conditions;
•   limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing;
•   requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes;
•   requiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete; and
•   placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources.
our ability to incur debt and the use of our funds could be limited by the restrictive covenants in the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility.
the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants, as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests. these covenants and requirements could limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and sales of assets. these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors, who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions. further, these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities.
risks related to corporate structure as a holding company, we could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to meet our financial obligations or other commitments.
our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash. we are a holding company, and our sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries, any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments, availability under our credit facility or any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future. the ability of our operating subsidiaries, including discovery communications, llc, to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions, including restrictions under our credit facility, to which they may be or may become subject. under the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act, we were subject to u.s. taxes for the deemed repatriation of certain cash balances held by foreign corporations. the company intends to continue to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the u.s., and current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our u.s. operations.
we have directors in common with those of liberty media corporation ("liberty media"), liberty global plc ("liberty global"), qurate retail group f/k/a liberty interactive corporation ("liberty interactive"), liberty broadband corporation ("liberty broadband"), and liberty latin america ltd ("lla"), which may result in the diversion of business opportunities or other potential conflicts.
liberty media, liberty global, liberty interactive, liberty broadband and lla (together, the "liberty entities") own interests in various u.s. and international companies, such as charter communications, inc. ("charter"), that have subsidiaries that own or operate domestic or foreign content services that may compete with the content services we offer. we have no rights in respect of u.s. or international content opportunities developed by or presented to the subsidiaries of any liberty entities, and the pursuit of these opportunities by such subsidiaries may adversely affect our interests and those of our stockholders. because we and the liberty entities have overlapping directors, the pursuit of business opportunities may serve to intensify the conflicts of interest or appearance of conflicts of interest faced by the respective management teams. our charter provides that none of our directors or officers will be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity (including any liberty entities), for which such individual serves as a director or officer, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us or any of our subsidiaries, unless (x) such opportunity was expressly offered to such individual solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of us or any of our subsidiaries and (y) such opportunity relates to a line of business in which we or any of our subsidiaries is then directly engaged.
we have directors that are also related persons of advance/newhouse and that overlap with those of the liberty entities, which may lead to conflicting interests for those tasked with the fiduciary duties of our board.
our twelve-person board of directors includes three designees of advance/newhouse, including robert j. miron, who was the chairman of advance/newhouse until december 31, 2010, and steven a. miron, the chief executive officer of advance/newhouse. in addition, our board of directors includes two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty media, three persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty global, one person who is currently a member of the board of directors of liberty interactive, two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty broadband, one person who is currently a member of the board of directors of charter, of which liberty broadband owns an equity interest, and two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of lla. john c. malone is the chairman of the boards of all of the liberty entities other than lla and liberty interactive. the parent company of advance/newhouse and the liberty entities own interests in a range of media, communications and entertainment businesses.
advance/newhouse will elect three directors annually for so long as it owns a specified minimum amount of our series a-1 convertible preferred stock. the advance/newhouse series a-1 convertible preferred stock, which votes with our common stock on all matters other than the election of directors, represents approximately 24% of the voting power of our outstanding shares. the series a-1 convertible preferred stock also grants advance/newhouse consent rights over a range of our corporate actions, including fundamental changes to our business, the issuance of additional capital stock, mergers and business combinations and certain acquisitions and dispositions.
none of the liberty entities own any interest in us. mr. malone beneficially owns stock of liberty media representing approximately 47% of the aggregate voting power of its outstanding stock, owns shares representing approximately 30% of the aggregate voting power of liberty global, shares representing approximately 40% of the aggregate voting power of liberty interactive, shares representing approximately 48% of the aggregate voting power of liberty broadband and shares representing approximately 21% of the aggregate voting power (other than with respect to the election of the common stock directors) of our outstanding stock. mr. malone controls approximately 28% of our aggregate voting power relating to the election of our eight common stock directors, assuming that the preferred stock owned by advance/newhouse has not been converted into shares of our common stock. our directors who are also directors of the liberty entities hold stock and stock-based compensation in the liberty entities and hold our stock and stock-based compensation.
these ownership interests and/or business positions could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us, advance/newhouse and/or the liberty entities. for example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when we, on the one hand, or advance/newhouse and/or one or more of the liberty entities, on the other hand, consider acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for the other.
the members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders. likewise, those persons who serve in similar capacities at advance/newhouse or a liberty entity have fiduciary duties to those companies. therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both respective companies, and there can be no assurance that the terms of any transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as would be the case in the absence of a conflict of interest.
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if such acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.
certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable. these provisions include the following:
•   authorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock: a series b that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a series a-1 that entitles the holders to one vote per share and a series c that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;
•   authorizing the series a-1 convertible preferred stock with special voting rights, which prohibits us from taking any of the following actions, among others, without the prior approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of such stock:
•   increasing the number of members of the board of directors above ten;
•   making any material amendment to our charter or by-laws;
•   engaging in a merger, consolidation or other business combination with any other entity; and
•   appointing or removing our chairman of the board or our chief executive officer;
•   authorizing the issuance of "blank check" preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;
•   classifying our common stock directors with staggered three-year terms and having three directors elected by the holders of the series a convertible preferred stock, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors;
•   limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;
•   prohibiting stockholder action by written consent (subject to certain exceptions), thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;
•   establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;
•   requiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 80% of our voting power or the approval by at least 75% of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our charter;
•   requiring the consent of the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding series b common stock (voting as a separate class) to certain share distributions and other corporate actions in which the voting power of the series b common stock would be diluted by, for example, issuing shares having multiple votes per share as a dividend to holders of series a common stock; and
•   the existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.
we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan in order to encourage anyone seeking to acquire us to negotiate with our board of directors prior to attempting a takeover. while the plan is designed to guard against coercive or unfair tactics to gain control of us, the plan may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying any attempts by others to obtain control of us.
holders of any single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if any action by our directors or officers has an adverse effect on only that series of common stock.
principles of delaware law and the provisions of our charter may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock. under delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, including the holders of all series of our common stock. principles of delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders. as a result, in some circumstances, our directors may be required to make a decision that is adverse to the holders of one series of common stock. under the principles of delaware law referred to above, stockholders may not be able to challenge these decisions if our board of directors is disinterested and adequately informed with respect to these decisions and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that it is acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders.
if advance/newhouse were to exercise its registration rights, it may cause a significant decline in our stock price, even if our business is doing well.
advance/newhouse has been granted registration rights covering all of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock held by advance/newhouse. advance/newhouse's series a-1 convertible preferred stock is currently convertible into nine shares of our series a common stock and advance/newhouse's series c-1 convertible preferred stock is convertible into 19.3648 shares of our series c common stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. the registration rights, which are immediately exercisable, are transferable with the sale or transfer by advance/newhouse of blocks of shares representing 10% or more of the preferred stock it holds. the exercise of the registration rights, and subsequent sale of possibly large amounts of our common stock in the public market, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
john c. malone and advance/newhouse each have significant voting power with respect to corporate matters considered by our stockholders.
for corporate matters other than the election of directors, mr. malone and advance/newhouse each beneficially own shares of our stock representing approximately 21% and 24%, respectively, of the aggregate voting power represented by our outstanding stock. with respect to the election of directors, mr. malone controls approximately 28% of the aggregate voting power relating to the election of the eight common stock directors (assuming that the convertible preferred stock owned by advance/newhouse (the "a/n preferred stock") has not been converted into shares of our common stock). the a/n preferred stock carries with it the right to designate three preferred stock directors to our board (subject to certain conditions) but does not carry voting rights with respect to the election of the eight common stock directors. also, under the terms of the a/n preferred stock, advance/newhouse has special voting rights as to certain enumerated matters, including material amendments to the restated charter and bylaws, fundamental changes in our business, mergers and other business combinations, certain acquisitions and dispositions and future issuances of capital stock. although there is no stockholder agreement, voting agreement or any similar arrangement between mr. malone and advance/newhouse, by virtue of their respective holdings, mr. malone and advance/newhouse each have significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. this section provides additional information regarding our businesses, current developments, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, contractual commitments and critical accounting policies.
a discussion of our results of operations and liquidity for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 can be found under item 7 in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018, filed on march 1, 2019, which is available free of charge on the sec's website at www.sec.gov and our investor relations website at ir.corporate.discovery.com.
business overview we are a global media company that provides content across multiple distribution platforms, including linear platforms such as pay-tv, fta and broadcast television, authenticated tve applications, digital distribution arrangements, content licensing arrangements and dtc subscription products. for a discussion of our global portfolio of networks and joint ventures see our business overview set forth in item 1, "business" in this annual report on form 10-k.
our objectives are to invest in content for our networks to build viewership, optimize distribution revenue, capture advertising sales and create or reposition branded channels and businesses that can sustain long-term growth and occupy a desired content niche with strong consumer appeal. our strategy is to maximize the distribution, ratings and profit potential of each of our branded networks. in addition to growing distribution and advertising revenues for our branded networks, we are extending content distribution across new platforms, including brand-aligned websites, on-line streaming, mobile devices, vod and broadband channels, which provide promotional platforms for our television content and serve as additional outlets for advertising and distribution revenue. audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators, dth satellite operators, telecommunication service providers, and other content distributors, that deliver our content to their customers.
our content spans genres including survival, natural history, exploration, sports, general entertainment, home, food and travel, heroes, adventure, crime and investigation, health and kids. we have an extensive library of high-definition content and own rights to much of our content and footage, which enables us to exploit our library to launch brands and services into new markets quickly. our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world on a variety of platforms.
although the company utilizes certain brands and content globally, we classify our operations in two reportable segments: u.s. networks, consisting principally of domestic television networks and digital distribution arrangements, and international networks, consisting primarily of international television networks and digital distribution arrangements. in addition, other consists principally of a production studio, and prior to the sale of the education business in april 2018, curriculum-based education products and services (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) our segment presentation aligns with our management structure and the financial information management uses to make strategic and operating decisions, such as the allocation of resources and business performance assessments. for further discussion of our company, segments in which we do business, and our content development activities and revenues, see our business overview set forth in item 1, "business" in this annual report on form 10-k.
results of operations the discussion below compares our actual results for the year ended december 31, 2019 to the year ended december 31, 2018, as well as our actual results for the year ended december 31, 2019 to pro forma combined results for the year ended december 31, 2018, as if the scripps networks acquisition occurred on january 1, 2017. scripps networks was acquired on march 6, 2018. management believes reviewing our actual operating results in addition to combined pro forma results is useful in identifying trends in, or reaching conclusions regarding, the overall operating performance of our businesses. our combined u.s. networks, international networks and corporate and inter-segment eliminations pro forma information is based on the historical operating results of the respective businesses as applicable to each segment and includes adjustments directly attributable to the prior year scripps networks acquisition as if it had occurred on january 1, 2017, such as:
1.   the impact of the purchase price allocation to the fair value of assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests, such as intangible amortization;
2.   adjustments to remove items associated with the acquisition of scripps networks that will not have a continuing impact on the combined entity, such as transaction costs and the impact of employee retention agreements; and
3.   changes to align accounting policies.
adjustments do not include costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated scripps networks since january 1, 2017 and should not be taken as indicative of the company's future consolidated results of operations.

advertising revenue increased 10% for the year ended december 31, 2019. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, advertising revenue increased 12%. on a pro forma combined basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, advertising revenue increased 3%. on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the increase was primarily a result of an increase of 3% and 4% at u.s. networks and international networks, respectively. increases at u.s. networks were attributable to increases in pricing, and to a lesser extent, the continued monetization of digital content offerings and inventory, partially offset by lower overall ratings and the secular declines in the pay television ecosystem. increases at international networks were primarily driven by the consolidation of the uktv lifestyle business, growth in dtc initiatives and to a lesser extent, higher pricing in certain markets in europe, partially offset by the impact of the olympics in 2018.
distribution revenue consists principally of fees from affiliates for distributing our linear networks, supplemented by revenue earned from svod content licensing and other emerging forms of digital distribution. the largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of linear distribution services for rights to our networks from cable, dth satellite and telecommunication service providers. we have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world, including the largest operators in the u.s. and major international distributors. distribution revenues are largely dependent on the rates negotiated in the agreements, the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content, the number of platforms covered in the distribution agreement, and the market demand for the content that we provide. from time to time, renewals of multi-year carriage agreements include significant year one market adjustments to re-set subscriber rates, which then increase at rates lower than the initial increase in the following years. in some cases, we have provided distributors launch incentives, in the form of cash payments or free periods, to carry our networks. distribution revenue also includes fees charged for bulk content arrangements and other subscription services for episodic content. these digital distribution revenues are impacted by the quantity, as well as the quality, of the content we provide.
distribution revenue increased 7% for the year ended december 31, 2019. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, distribution revenue increased 9%. on a pro forma combined basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, distribution revenue increased 5%. on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the increase was primarily a result of an increase of 5% at both u.s. networks and international networks. increases at u.s. networks were attributable to increases in contractual affiliate rates and additional carriage on virtual multichannel video programming distributors, partially offset by a decline in overall subscribers. increases at international networks were primarily attributable to the impact of certain content licensing arrangements in our latin america business unit, higher affiliate rates in europe and monetization of dtc initiatives in europe and asia.
we also generate other revenue associated with content production from our production studio. prior to the sale of the education business in april 2018, we generated other revenue from curriculum-based products and services, the licensing of our brands for consumer products and third-party content sales.
other revenue decreased 47% for the year ended december 31, 2019. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, other revenue decreased 45%. on a pro forma combined basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, other revenue decreased 47%. on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the decrease was primarily a result of decreases of 29% and 50% at u.s. networks and international networks, respectively. the decreases were primarily attributable to the impact of sublicensing of olympics sports rights in 2018.
revenue for our segments is discussed separately below under the heading "segment results of operations."
costs of revenues our principal component of costs of revenues is content expense. content expense includes television series, television specials, films, sporting events and digital products. the costs of producing a content asset and bringing that asset to market consist of film costs, participation costs, exploitation costs and manufacturing costs.
costs of revenues decreased 3% for the year ended december 31, 2019. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, costs of revenue decreased 1%. on a pro forma combined basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, costs of revenue decreased 6%. on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the decrease was primarily a result of a decrease of 5% and 6% at u.s. networks and international networks, respectively. as reported content rights expense was $2.9 billion for each of the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018. decreases at u.s. networks were primarily driven by lower content amortization due to content synergies related to the integration of scripps networks. decreases at international networks were primarily attributable to the impact of costs related to the olympics in 2018, partially offset by higher investments in linear content and our dtc initiatives, and consolidation of the uktv lifestyle business.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, occupancy and back office support fees. selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6% for the year ended december 31, 2019. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, selling, general and administrative increased 11%. on a pro forma combined basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3%. on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the increase was primarily a result of an increase of 11% at international networks, partially offset by a 3% decline at u.s. networks. increases at international networks were primarily due to investments in technology and personnel as well as higher marketing expenses driven by subscriber acquisition costs for our dtc initiatives, partially offset by the olympics and certain channel launches in asia in 2018. decreases at u.s. networks were primarily driven by cost reductions in personnel, technology and professional services fees, partially offset by higher marketing expenses in support of our dtc initiatives.
impairment of goodwill goodwill impairment expense of $155 million was recorded during the year ended december 31, 2019. there was no goodwill impairment expense recorded for the year ended december 31, 2018. (see note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. depreciation and amortization decreased 4% for the year ended december 31, 2019. the decrease is primarily attributable to amortization related to the advertising revenue backlog intangible recorded as part of the acquisition of scripps networks, which had a one-year useful life and was fully amortized during the first quarter of 2019.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges were $26 million and $750 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the restructuring and other charges for the year ended december 31, 2018 included content impairments associated with changes in programming strategies, involuntary severance actions associated with the integration of scripps networks, costs associated with the termination of long-term programming arrangements, and lease exit costs.
gain on disposition there was no gain on disposition for the year ended december 31, 2019. for the year ended december 31, 2018 there was a gain of $84 million due to the sale of a controlling stake in the education business in april 2018. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
interest expense, net interest expense decreased 7% during the year ended december 31, 2019. the decrease was primarily attributable to interest income related to the change in fair value of the company's cross currency swaps and an overall reduction in debt levels. (see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
loss from equity investees, net we reported losses from our equity method investees of $2 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to losses of $63 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the changes are attributable to the company's share of earnings and losses from its equity investees.

income tax expense was $81 million and $341 million, and our effective tax rate was 4% and 33% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. the decrease in income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to the discrete, one-time, non-cash deferred tax benefit of $445 million from legal entity restructurings discussed below. additionally, the decrease in income tax expense was attributable to a decrease in the provision for uncertain tax positions and a decrease in the effect of foreign operations, which was mainly driven by the establishment of certain valuation allowances during the year ended december 31, 2018 that did not recur in 2019, and a tax benefit realized during the year ended december 31, 2019 from the final regulations related to the determination of the foreign tax credit released by the u.s. treasury department and irs in december 2019. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in income and the impact of a goodwill impairment charge that was non-deductible for tax purposes during the year ended december 31, 2019. finally, the income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 included a one-time discrete tax benefit from u.s. legislative changes that extended the accelerated deduction of qualified film productions.
we carried out numerous internal transactions during the year ended december 31, 2019 that were intended to integrate assets acquired from the scripps networks business with the discovery business; streamline and simplify our corporate entity structures; simplify our internal financing structures; respond to the expected exit of the united kingdom from the european union; make our managerial structures and processes more efficient and nimble; and reduce costs associated with the maintenance of legal entities. these transactions included mergers, liquidations, and intercompany sales among members of the consolidated discovery group. some of these transactions have resulted in changes in certain of our deferred tax items, which are based on differences between the book versus tax bases of the assets and liabilities and on certain tax attributes, such as net operating loss carryovers. the items involved in these restructurings relate to a variety of jurisdictions in our international networks segment. recent changes in accounting for intercompany transactions have also impacted our effective tax rate. for example, following our adoption of accounting standards update 2016-16, effective january 1, 2018, the income tax effects of intercompany transfers will be recognized in the period in which the transfer occurs, rather than amortized over time, which will increase the impact of such transfers on our effective tax rate in the periods in which the transfers occur. moreover, u.s. tax reform has a continued effect as the u.s. treasury department issues final regulations clarifying application of the new law; and several tax controversies have come to resolution. the net effect of the various changes in our deferred tax balances and related valuation allowances has been the recognition of a one-time, non-cash deferred income tax benefit of $445 million during the year ended december 31, 2019.
segment results of operations - 2019 vs. 2018
we evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and adjusted oibda. adjusted oibda is defined as operating income excluding: (i) employee share-based compensation, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) restructuring and other charges, (iv) certain impairment charges, (v) gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, (vi) certain inter-segment eliminations related to production studios, (vii) third-party transaction costs directly related to the acquisition and integration of scripps networks and other transactions, and (viii) other items impacting comparability, such as the non-cash settlement of a withholding tax claim. we use this measure to assess the operating results and performance of our segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. we believe adjusted oibda is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. we exclude share-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and acquisition and integration costs from the calculation of adjusted oibda due to their impact on comparability between periods. we also exclude the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives.
adjusted oibda should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").
effective january 1, 2019, our definition of adjusted oibda was modified to exclude all employee share-based compensation, whereas only mark-to-market share-based compensation was previously excluded. over time, the company has moved to a higher percentage of equity-classified awards (in lieu of liability-classified awards, which require mark-to-market accounting) under its stock incentive plans and expects to continue this practice in future periods. since most equity classified awards are non-cash expenses not entirely under management control, we have elected to exclude all share-based compensation from adjusted oibda beginning in 2019. the revised definition of adjusted oibda was used by our chief operating decision maker in evaluating segment performance in 2019. accordingly, prior period amounts have been recast to reflect the current definition.
additional financial information for our segments and geographical areas in which we do business is discussed in note 23 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
the table below presents our adjusted oibda by segment, with a reconciliation of consolidated net income available to discovery, inc. to total adjusted oibda (in millions).

revenues as reported advertising revenue increased 13% for the year ended december 31, 2019. on a pro forma combined basis, advertising revenue increased 3%. the increases for such periods were attributable to increases in pricing, and to a lesser extent, the continued monetization of digital content offerings and inventory, partially offset by lower overall ratings and secular declines in the pay television ecosystem. on an as reported basis, advertising revenue was additionally impacted by the prior year acquisition of scripps networks.
as reported distribution revenue increased 12% for the year ended december 31, 2019. on a pro forma combined basis, distribution revenue increased 5%. the increases for such periods were attributable to increases in contractual affiliate rates and additional carriage on virtual multichannel video programming distributors, partially offset by a decline in overall subscribers. on an as reported basis, distribution revenue was additionally impacted by the prior year acquisition of scripps networks. total portfolio subscribers declined 5% for the year ended december 31, 2019, while subscribers to our fully distributed networks declined 3% for the same period.
as reported other revenue decreased $37 million. on a pro forma combined basis, other revenue decreased $44 million.
costs of revenues as reported costs of revenues increased 3% for the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily due to the prior year acquisition of scripps networks. on a pro forma combined basis, costs of revenues decreased 5%, primarily driven by lower content amortization due to content synergies related to the integration of scripps networks. content expense was $1.5 billion for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. pro forma combined content expense was $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. content impairment is generally a component of costs of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. however, during the year ended december 31, 2018, content impairments of $221 million were reflected as a component of restructuring and other charges as a result of the strategic programming changes following the acquisition of scripps networks. no content impairments were recorded as a component of restructuring and other charges during the year ended december 31, 2019.

selling, general and administrative as reported selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7% for the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily due to the prior year acquisition of scripps networks. on a pro forma combined basis, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3%, primarily as a result of cost reductions in personnel, technology and professional services fees, partially offset by higher marketing expenses in support of our dtc initiatives.
adjusted oibda adjusted oibda increased 18%, primarily due to the factors described above. on a pro forma combined basis, adjusted oibda increased 10%.

corporate operations primarily consist of executive management, administrative support services, substantially all of our share-based compensation and transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of scripps networks.
the adjusted oibda decreased 29% in 2019 as compared to 2018. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and on a pro forma combined basis adjusted oibda decreased 24%, the decreases were primarily due to transformation projects related to technology infrastructure and software development, facilities-related expenses due to real estate consolidation, and higher professional services fees.
items impacting comparability the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons of our results. for example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the u.s dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis (ex-fx), in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-fx excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. the presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap.
the ex-fx change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. the ex-fx change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, which is a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process (the "2019 baseline rate"), and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2019 baseline rate. in addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-fx results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities, as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. selling, general and administrative expense, as presented below, excludes share-based compensation and transaction and integration costs related to scripps networks and other transactions due to their impact on comparability between periods.

liquidity and capital resources liquidity sources of cash historically, we have generated a significant amount of cash from operations. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we funded our working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations. as of december 31, 2019, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. we are a well-known seasoned issuer and have demonstrated the ability to conduct registered offerings of securities, including debt securities, common stock and preferred stock, on short notice. access to sufficient capital from the public market is not assured.
•   debt
2019 senior notes activity in 2019, discovery communications, llc ("dcl") issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal of senior notes (the "2029 notes and 2049 notes"). all of dcl's outstanding senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by the company and scripps networks and contain certain covenants, events of default and other customary provisions.
2018 senior notes activity in connection with the scripps networks acquisition in 2018, the company assumed $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of the scripps networks 2.750% senior notes due 2019, 2.800% senior notes due 2020, 3.500% senior notes due 2022, 3.900% senior notes due 2024 and 3.950% senior notes due 2025 (together, the "scripps networks senior notes").
pursuant to the offering memorandum and consent solicitation statement to exchange dated march 5, 2018, the company completed the exchange of $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount of scripps networks senior notes, for $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount of dcl's 2.750% senior notes due 2019, 2.800% senior notes due 2020, 3.500% senior notes due 2022, 3.900% senior notes due 2024 and 3.950% senior notes due 2025. the exchange was accounted for as a debt modification and, as a result, third-party issuance costs were expensed as incurred.
revolving credit facility the company has access to a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. borrowing capacity under this agreement is reduced by the outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2019, the company had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. all obligations of dcl and the other borrowers under the revolving credit facility are unsecured and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company.
the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility (the "credit agreement") contains customary representations, warranties and events of default, as well as affirmative and negative covenants. as of december 31, 2019, the company was in compliance with all covenants and there were no events of default under the credit agreement.
commercial paper under our commercial paper program and subject to market conditions, dcl may issue unsecured commercial paper notes guaranteed by the company from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of $1.5 billion, including up to $0.5 billion of euro denominated borrowings. the maturities of these notes vary but may not exceed 397 days. the notes may be issued at a discount or at par, and interest rates vary based on market conditions and the credit rating assigned to the notes at the time of issuance. as of december 31, 2019, the company had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility arrangement referenced above.
term loans in august 2017, dcl entered into a three-year delayed draw tranche and a five-year delayed draw tranche unsecured term loan credit facility (the "term loans"), each with a principal amount of up to $1 billion. the term of each delayed draw loan commenced in march 2018 when discovery used these funds to finance a portion of the acquisition of scripps networks. as of december 31, 2018, the company had used cash from operations and borrowings under the commercial paper program to fully repay the term loan borrowings.
uses of cash our primary uses of cash include the creation and acquisition of new content, business acquisitions, repurchases of our capital stock, income taxes, personnel costs, principal and interest on our outstanding senior notes, and funding for various equity method and other investments.
•   investments and business combinations the company acquired golf digest for $36 million in cash and acquired a controlling interest in play sports group limited for $41 million in cash. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
during 2018, discovery completed the scripps networks acquisition for total consideration of $12.0 billion, including cash of $8.8 billion and stock of $3.2 billion. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
our uses of cash have included investments in equity method investments and equity investments without readily determinable fair value. (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) we provide funding to our investees from time to time. the company contributed $254 million and $61 million for investments in and advances to our investees for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. in addition, capital expenditures (net of proceeds from sale of assets) increased by $206 million during the year ended december 31, 2019.
•   redeemable noncontrolling interest and noncontrolling interest due to business combinations, we also have redeemable equity balances of $442 million, which may require the use of cash in the event holders of noncontrolling interests put their interests to the company. (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) distributions to redeemable noncontrolling interests and noncontrolling interests totaled $250 million and $76 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
•   content acquisition we plan to continue to invest significantly in the creation and acquisition of new content. additional information regarding contractual commitments to acquire content is set forth in "commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements" in this item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
•   common stock repurchases historically, we have funded our stock repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and the issuance of debt. in april 2019, our board of directors authorized additional stock repurchases of up to $1 billion. under this stock repurchase authorization, management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases at prevailing prices or privately negotiated purchases subject to market conditions and other factors. (see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) during the year ended december 31, 2019, the company repurchased 23.2 million shares of its series c common stock for $633 million.
•   income taxes and interest we expect to continue to make payments for income taxes and interest on our outstanding senior notes. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we made cash payments of $562 million and $708 million for income taxes and interest on our outstanding debt, respectively.
•   debt during 2019, the company redeemed $900 million of senior notes and floating rate notes as they came due.
the company used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 notes and 2049 notes to redeem and repurchase $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. the repayment resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $23 million.
the company redeemed $411 million aggregate principal senior notes and made open market bond repurchases of $55 million during the year ended december 31, 2019, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $5 million.
the company has $600 million of outstanding senior notes coming due in june 2020.

operating activities cash provided by operating activities was $3.4 billion and $2.6 billion during the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income excluding non-cash items following the acquisition of scripps networks, partially offset by a negative fluctuation in working capital activity.
investing activities cash used in investing activities was $438 million and $8.6 billion during the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which was primarily attributable to the acquisition of scripps networks in 2018. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
51
financing activities cash used in financing activities was $2.4 billion and $283 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2019, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to principal repayments of debt and the revolving credit facility, stock repurchases, and distributions to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests, partially offset by the issuance of 10- and 30-year notes.
capital resources as of december 31, 2019, capital resources were comprised of the following (in millions).

(a) there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility or commercial paper program outstanding as of december 31, 2019.
(b) interest on senior notes is paid annually, semi-annually or quarterly. our senior notes outstanding as of december 31, 2019 had interest rates that ranged from 1.90% to 6.35% and will mature between 2020 and 2049.
we expect that our cash balance, cash generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the next twelve months. our borrowing costs and access to the capital markets can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics, such as interest coverage and leverage ratios.
as of december 31, 2019, we held $219 million of our $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents in our foreign subsidiaries. the 2017 tax act enacted on december 22, 2017 features a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income and imposes a mandatory repatriation toll tax on unremitted foreign earnings. notwithstanding the u.s. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to the u.s. however, if these funds are needed in the u.s., we would be required to accrue and pay non-u.s. taxes to repatriate them. the determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable.
additional information regarding the changes in our outstanding indebtedness and the significant terms and provisions of our revolving credit facility and outstanding indebtedness is discussed in note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.

commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements obligations as of december 31, 2019, our significant contractual obligations, including related payments due by period, were as follows (in millions).
payments due by period total            less than 1 year             1-3 years             3-5 years           more than 5 years long-term debt:

the above table does not include certain long-term obligations as the timing or the amount of the payments cannot be predicted. the current portion of the liability for cash-settled share-based compensation awards was $47 million as of december 31, 2019. additionally, reserves for unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the above table because we are unable to predict reasonably the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. our unrecognized tax benefits totaled $375 million as of december 31, 2019.
the above table also does not include dcl's revolving credit facility that, during the year ended december 31, 2019, allowed dcl and certain designated foreign subsidiaries of dcl to borrow up to $2.5 billion, including a $100 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $50 million sublimit for swingline loans. borrowing capacity under this agreement is reduced by the outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program (see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) as of december 31, 2019, the revolving credit facility agreement provided for a maturity date of august 11, 2022 and the option for up to two additional 364-day renewal periods.
from time to time we may provide our equity method investees additional funding that has not been committed to as of december 31, 2019 based on unforeseen investee opportunities or cash flow needs. (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
long-term debt principal payments on long-term debt reflect the repayment of our outstanding senior notes, at face value, assuming repayment will occur upon maturity. interest payments on our outstanding senior notes are projected based on their contractual rate and maturity.
finance lease obligations we acquire satellite transponders and other equipment through multi-year finance lease arrangements. principal payments on finance lease obligations reflect amounts due under our finance lease agreements. interest payments on our outstanding finance lease obligations are based on the stated or implied rate in our finance lease agreements.
operating lease obligations we obtain office space and equipment under multi-year lease arrangements. most operating leases are not cancelable prior to their expiration. payments for operating leases represent the amounts due under the agreements assuming the agreements are not canceled prior to their expiration.
purchase obligations content purchase obligations include commitments and liabilities associated with third-party producers and sports associations for content that airs on our television networks. production contracts generally require: purchase of a specified number of episodes; payments over the term of the license; and include both programs that have been delivered and are available for airing and programs that have not yet been produced or sporting events that have not yet taken place. if the content is ultimately never produced, our commitments expire without obligation. the commitments disclosed above exclude content liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. we expect to enter into additional production contracts and content licenses to meet our future content needs.
other purchase obligations include agreements with certain vendors and suppliers for the purchase of goods and services whereby the underlying agreements are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms. significant purchase obligations include transmission services, television rating services, marketing research, employment contracts, equipment purchases, and information technology and other services. the company has contracts that do not require the purchase of fixed or minimum quantities and generally may be terminated with a 30-day to 60-day advance notice without penalty, and are not included in the table above past the 30-day to 60-day advance notice period. amounts related to employment contracts include base compensation and do not include compensation contingent on future events.
put rights the company has granted put rights to certain consolidated subsidiaries, which have been excluded from the table above since we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of any payment.. the company recorded the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest in the equity associated with the put rights as a component of redeemable noncontrolling interest in the amount of $442 million. (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
pension obligations we sponsor a qualified defined benefit pension plan ("pension plan") that covers certain u.s.-based employees. we also have a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan ("serp").
contractual commitments summarized in the contractual obligations table include payments to meet minimum funding requirements of our pension plan in 2020 and estimated benefit payments for our serp. payments for the serp have been estimated over a ten-year period. while benefit payments under these plans are expected to continue beyond 2029, we believe it is not practicable to estimate payments beyond this period.
non-controlling interest the food network and cooking channel are operated and organized under the terms of the tv food network partnership (the "partnership"). the company and a non-controlling owner hold interests in the partnership. during the fourth quarter of 2016, the partnership agreement was extended and specifies a dissolution date of december 31, 2020. if the term of the partnership is not extended prior to that date, the partnership agreement permits the company, as holder of 80% of the applicable votes, to reconstitute the partnership and continue its business. if for some reason the partnership is not continued, it will be required to limit its activities to winding up, settling debts, liquidating assets and distributing proceeds to the partners in proportion to their partnership interests.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in item 303(a)(4) of regulation s-k) that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
related party transactions in the ordinary course of business, we enter into transactions with related parties, primarily our equity method investees and the liberty entities. information regarding transactions and amounts with related parties is discussed in note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
new accounting and reporting pronouncements we adopted certain accounting and reporting standards during 2019. information regarding our adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap, which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k and accompanying notes. management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is material to reporting our financial condition and results of operations, and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company. we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
uncertain tax positions the company is subject to income taxes in numerous u.s. and foreign jurisdictions. from time to time, the company engages in transactions or takes filing positions in which the tax consequences may be uncertain and may recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. the company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless the company determines that such positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on their technical merits, including the resolution of any appeals or litigation processes. the company includes interest and where appropriate, potential penalties, in its tax reserves. this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events including the status and results of income tax audits with the relevant tax authorities. significant judgment is exercised in evaluating all relevant information, the technical merits of the tax positions, and the timely identification and accurate measurement of uncertain tax positions when determining the amount of reserve and whether positions taken on the company's tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained. this also involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the potential outcome of positions taken on tax returns that may be reviewed by tax authorities.
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is allocated to our reporting units, which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments (the component level). reporting units are determined by the discrete financial information available for the component and whether it is regularly reviewed by segment management. components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they share similar economic characteristics. our reporting units are as follows: u.s. networks, europe, latin america, and asia-pacific.
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or earlier upon the occurrence of substantive unfavorable changes in economic conditions, industry trends, costs, cash flows, or ongoing declines in market capitalization. if we believe that as a result of our qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is required. the quantitative impairment test requires significant judgment in determining the fair value of the reporting units. we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow ("dcf") method and the market multiple approach, which incorporates the use of ebitda multiples based on market data. for the dcf method, we use projections specific to the reporting unit, as well as those based on general economic conditions, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions. determining fair value specific to each reporting unit requires the company to exercise judgment when selecting the appropriate discount rates, control premiums, terminal growth rates, assumed tax rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, including revenue growth rates and profit margins. the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis for each reporting unit are based on the reporting unit's budget, long range plan, and recent operating performance. discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and market conditions.
during the fourth quarter of 2018, the company performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units exceeded their carrying values, except for its asia-pacific reporting unit. for the asia-pacific reporting unit, the company then performed a quantitative step 1 impairment test, which indicated limited headroom (the excess of fair value over carrying value) of 10%.
given the limited headroom in the asia-pacific reporting unit, the company closely monitored its results during 2019. during the third quarter, due to an increasingly challenging business environment in the asia-pacific region, which included 1) moderating revenue growth projections, 2) underperformance of certain sports investments, 3) heightened volatility in china and surrounding economies, and 4) a decline in asia-pacific stock price multiples for peer media companies, the company believed the increased risk required it to perform an interim impairment test. the step 1 test utilized a dcf valuation methodology. significant judgments and assumptions included the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates ranging from 2% to 2.5%, and a discount rate of 11%. the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis for the asia-pacific reporting unit were based on the reporting unit's budget and long-term business plan. the results of the step 1 test indicated that the carrying value of the net assets in the asia-pacific reporting unit exceeded its fair value.
in the second step of the impairment test, the company hypothetically assigned the asia-pacific reporting unit's fair value to its individual assets and liabilities, including unrecognized intangible assets such as customer relationships and trade names, in a hypothetical purchase price allocation that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. the fair value estimates incorporated in step 2 for the hypothetical intangible assets were based on the excess earnings income approach for customer relationships and the relief-from-royalty method for trademarks. key judgments made by management in step 2 of the impairment test included revenue growth rates, length of contract term, number of renewals, customer attrition rates, market-based royalty rates, and market-based tax rates. the step 2 impairment test indicated an implied fair value of goodwill of $40 million, which resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $155 million during the three months ended september 30, 2019.
in 2019, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for our reporting units based on our policy of performing a quantitative impairment test every three years, irrespective of the outcome of the qualitative assessment. the europe reporting unit, which had headroom of 19%, was the only reporting unit with fair value in excess of carrying value of less than 20%. during our annual impairment testing, we evaluated the sensitivity of our most critical assumption, the discount rate, and determined that a 100 basis point change in the discount rate selected would not have impacted the test results. additionally, the company could reduce the terminal growth rate by 50 basis points, and the fair value of the europe reporting unit would still exceed its carrying value.  as of december 31, 2019, the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the europe reporting unit was $1.9 billion. management will continue to monitor this reporting unit for changes in the business environment that could impact recoverability. the recoverability of goodwill is dependent upon the continued growth of cash flows from our business activities. additionally, as the europe reporting unit operates in foreign markets with various functional currencies and has significant u.s. dollar denominated assets, changes in foreign exchange rates that result in strengthening of the u.s. dollar may negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit and the calculation of excess carrying value.
content rights content rights principally consist of television series, specials, films and sporting events. costs of produced and coproduced content consist of development costs, acquired production costs, direct production costs, certain production overhead costs and participation costs and is capitalized if the company has previously generated revenues from similar content in established markets and the content will be used and revenues will be generated for a period of at least one year.
linear content amortization expense for each period is recognized based on the revenue forecast model, which approximates the proportion that estimated distribution and advertising revenues for the current period represent in relation to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues. digital content amortization for each period is recognized based on estimated viewing patterns as there are no direct revenues to associate to the individual content assets and therefore, number of views is most representative of the use of the title. significant judgment is required to determine the useful lives and amortization patterns of the company's content assets.
critical assumptions used in determining content amortization include: (i) the grouping of content by network and or genre, (ii) the application of a quantitative revenue forecast model based on the historical data, (iii) determining the appropriate historical periods to utilize and the relative weighting of those historical periods in the revenue forecast model, (iv) assessing the accuracy of the company's revenue forecasts and (v) incorporating secondary streams. the company then considers the appropriate application of the quantitative assessment given forecasted content use, expected content investment and market trends. content use and future revenues may differ from estimates based on changes in expectations related to market acceptance, network affiliate fee rates, advertising demand, the number of cable and satellite television subscribers receiving the company's networks, the number of subscribers to our digital services, and program usage. accordingly, the company continually reviews revenue estimates and planned usage and revises its assumptions if necessary.
consolidation the company has ownership and other interests in and contractual arrangements with various entities, including corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies. for each such entity, the company evaluates its ownership, other interests and contractual arrangements to determine whether it should consolidate the entity or account for its interest as an investment at inception and upon reconsideration events. as part of its evaluation, the company initially determines whether the entity is a variable interest entity ("vie"). management evaluates key considerations through a qualitative and quantitative analysis in determining whether an entity is a vie including whether (i) the entity has sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties, (ii) the ability or inability to make significant decisions about the entity's operations, and (iii) the proportionality of voting rights of investors relative to their obligations to absorb the expected losses (or receive the expected returns) of the entity. if the entity is a vie and if the company has a variable interest in the entity, the company uses judgment in determining if it is the primary beneficiary and is thus required to consolidate the entity. in making this determination, the company evaluates whether it or another party involved with the vie (1) has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie.
if it is concluded that an entity is not a vie, the company considers its proportional voting interests in the entity and consolidates majority-owned subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained. a controlling financial interest is determined by majority ownership and the absence of substantive third-party participation rights. key factors considered by the company in determining the presence of substantive third-party participation rights include, but are not limited to, control of the board of directors, budget approval or veto rights, or operational rights that significantly impact the economic performance of the business such as programming, creative development, marketing, and selection of key personnel. ownership interests in unconsolidated entities for which the company has significant influence are accounted for as equity method.
revenue recognition during 2018, we updated our revenue recognition policies in conjunction with our adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance as further described in note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. as described in note 2, the company generates advertising revenues primarily from advertising sold on its television networks and websites and distribution revenues from fees charged to distributors of its network content, which include cable, direct-to-home satellite, telecommunications and digital service providers and bundled long-term content arrangements, as well as through dtc subscription services..
revenue contracts with our advertising customers may include multiple distinct performance obligations. for example, linear and digital advertising contracts may include sponsorship, production, or product integration in addition to the airing of spots and the satisfaction of an audience guarantee. for such contracts, judgment is required in allocating the contract value to the individual performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. various factors such as prior transactions, rate cards and other market indicators are used to determine the standalone selling price of each performance obligation and accordingly, how much revenue is allocated to each performance obligation. for these contracts, revenue recorded when each performance obligation has been satisfied and value has been transferred to the customer.
a substantial portion of the advertising contracts in the u.s. and certain international markets guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience level that either the program in which their advertisements are aired or the advertisement will reach. these advertising campaigns are considered to represent a single, distinct performance obligation. for such contracts, judgement is required in measuring progress across the company's single performance obligation. various factors such as rate cards and audience guarantees are considered in determining how to appropriately measure progress across the campaigns. revenues are ultimately recognized based on the audience level delivered multiplied by the average price per impression.
the company also enters into certain distribution contracts with customers that include promises to deliver content libraries. there are generally two types of such arrangements: 1) content licensing arrangements that include subscription video on demand ("svod") licensing arrangements and 2) digital dtc content (such as vod and authenticated tve applications) which is a performance obligation within our distribution arrangements. these contracts vary by customer and in certain instances include a promise to deliver existing content and new content. in these arrangements, the individual program titles delivered represent a distinct performance obligation.
for svod arrangements, which typically contain a fixed fee, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on that performance obligation's relative standalone selling price. if multiple individual program titles are included in the same licensing contract, each program is considered distinct, and therefore a separate performance obligation. various factors such as the length of the license term, program exclusivity, and historical performance on our linear networks are used to determine the standalone selling price of each program and accordingly, how much revenue is allocated to each performance obligation. in contracts where existing individual program titles are delivered at the onset of the arrangement, revenue is recognized at that time based on the relative standalone selling price of additional individual program titles. more revenue is recognized during the contract term as additional performance obligations are satisfied via the delivery of these individual program titles. in the case of digital dtc content, content is regularly refreshed over the term of the agreement, as new titles are added and older titles are removed. consequently, satisfaction of the performance obligations generally occurs in the same pattern as the delivery of the linear feed. the company evaluates arrangements to assess whether there is material value associated with content delivered at the outset of a fixed price contract. if there is material value, then company allocates contract consideration to those deliverables for purposes of revenue recognition.

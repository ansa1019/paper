item 1a.    risk factors this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. if any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that are not addressed below or that we have not yet identified, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected and the value of our securities could decline.
we have grouped these risk factors into three general categories:
•   risks arising from our business;
•   risks arising from our capital structure; and
•   risks arising from our status as a reit.
risks arising from our business the properties managed by atria and sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; adverse developments in atria's and sunrise's business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us.
as of december 31, 2019, atria and sunrise, collectively, managed 260 of our consolidated seniors housing communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. these properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio, based on their gross book value, and account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi. although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, we rely on atria's and sunrise's personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations. we also rely on atria and sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate our seniors housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. for example, we depend on atria's and sunrise's ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our seniors housing communities. a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force atria or sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel, but it may not be able to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses, any failure by atria or sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel, or significant changes in atria's or sunrise's senior management or equity ownership could adversely affect the income we receive from our seniors housing communities and have a material adverse effect on us.
because atria and sunrise manage our properties in exchange for the receipt of a management fee from us, we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of our managers in the same manner or to the same extent as our triple-net tenants. however, any adverse developments in atria's and sunrise's business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a material adverse effect on us. if atria or sunrise experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties due to a weak economy or otherwise, such difficulties could result in, among other adverse events, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital, the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties, or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the u.s. bankruptcy code, any one or a combination of which indirectly could have a material adverse effect on us.
our leases and other agreements with brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living, ardent or kindred to satisfy its obligations under our agreements could have a material adverse effect on us.
the properties we lease to brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi, and we depend on brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties and properties that are collateral for the loans. we cannot assure you that brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy their respective obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living, ardent or kindred to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any failure by brookdale senior living, ardent or kindred to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve such properties could adversely affect its business reputation and its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in such properties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot assure you that brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations.
we face potential adverse consequences from the bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors.
we lease our properties to unaffiliated tenants or operate them through independent third-party managers. we are also a direct or indirect lender to various tenants and operators.  we have very limited control over the success or failure of our tenants' and operators' businesses and, at any time, a tenant or operator may experience a downturn in its business that weakens its financial condition. if that happens, the tenant or operator may fail to make its payments to us when due. although our lease, loan and management agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us, we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches.
a downturn in any of our tenants' or operators' businesses could ultimately lead to bankruptcy if it is unable to timely resolve the underlying causes, which may be largely outside of its control. bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable, or, at the least, delay our ability to pursue such remedies and realize any recoveries in connection therewith. for example, we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing.
a debtor-lessee may reject our lease in a bankruptcy proceeding, in which case our claim against the debtor-lessee for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap of the u.s. bankruptcy code. this statutory cap could be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and any claim we have for unpaid rent might not be paid in full. in addition, a debtor-lessee may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that our lease should be re-characterized as a financing agreement, in which case our rights and remedies as a lender, compared to a landlord, generally would be more limited. if a debtor-manager seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in any of these events, we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant, operator or manager.
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings may also result in increased costs to the operator and significant management distraction. if we are unable to transition affected properties, they could experience prolonged operational disruption, leading to lower occupancy rates and further depressed revenues. publicity about the operator's financial condition and insolvency proceedings may also negatively impact their and our reputations, decreasing customer demand and revenues. any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on us. these risks would be magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator under a master lease, as an operator failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties.
we have rights to terminate our management agreements with atria and sunrise in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances, and we may be unable to replace atria or sunrise if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed.
we are parties to long-term management agreements pursuant to which atria and sunrise, collectively, provided comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to 260 of our consolidated seniors housing communities as of december 31, 2019. most of our management agreements with atria have terms expiring either july 31, 2024 or december 31, 2027, with successive automatic ten-year renewal periods, and most of our management agreements with sunrise have terms ranging from 25 to 30 years (which commenced as early as 2004 and as recently as 2012). our ability to terminate these long-term management agreements is limited to specific circumstances set forth in the agreements and may relate to all properties or a specific property or group of properties.
we may terminate any of our management agreements with atria and sunrise upon the occurrence of an event of default by the operator in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any license or certificate necessary for operation), subject in most cases to such operator's right to cure such default, or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to such operator. in addition, we may terminate our management agreements with atria based on their failure to achieve certain noi targets or upon the payment of a fee. we also may terminate most of our management agreements with sunrise based on the failure to achieve certain noi targets, subject to certain rights of sunrise to make cure payments to us, and upon the occurrence of certain other events or the existence of certain other conditions.
we continually monitor and assess our contractual rights and remedies under our management agreements with atria and sunrise. when determining whether to pursue any existing or future rights or remedies under those agreements, including termination rights, we consider numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations. in the event that we exercise our rights to terminate the atria or sunrise management agreements for any reason or such agreements are not renewed upon expiration of their terms, we would attempt to reposition the affected properties with another manager. although we believe that many qualified national and regional seniors housing operators would be interested in managing our seniors housing communities, we cannot assure you that we would be able to locate another suitable manager or, if we are successful in locating such a manager, that it would manage the properties effectively. moreover, the transition to a replacement manager would require approval by the applicable regulatory authorities and, in most cases, the mortgage lenders for the properties, and we cannot assure you that such approvals would be granted on a timely basis, if at all. any inability to replace, or a lengthy delay in replacing, atria or sunrise as the manager of our seniors housing communities following termination or non-renewal of the applicable management agreements could have a material adverse effect on us.
if we must replace any of our tenants or operators, we might be unable to reposition the properties on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases beyond their current term. if our leases with brookdale senior living or ardent, the kindred master leases or any of our other triple-net leases are not renewed, we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator. in case of non-renewal, we generally have one year prior to expiration of the lease term to arrange for repositioning of the properties and our tenants are required to continue to perform all of their obligations (including the payment of all rental amounts) for the non-renewed assets until such expiration. however, following expiration of a lease term or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant or operator in default, rental payments on the related properties could decline or cease altogether while we reposition the properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator. we also might not be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases or other arrangements with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all, and we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned. in addition, we may incur certain obligations and liabilities, including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
in the event of non-renewal or a tenant default, our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, con or other laws, as well as by the medicare and medicaid change-of-ownership rules, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. our ability to locate and attract suitable replacement tenants also could be impaired by the specialized healthcare uses or contractual restrictions on use of the properties, and we may be forced to spend substantial amounts to adapt the properties to other uses. any such delays, limitations and expenses could adversely impact our ability to collect rent, obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise exercise remedies for tenant default and could have a material adverse effect on us.
moreover, in connection with certain of our properties, we have entered into intercreditor agreements with the tenants' lenders or tri-party agreements with our lenders. our ability to exercise remedies under the applicable leases or management agreements or to reposition the applicable properties may be significantly delayed or limited by the terms of the intercreditor agreement or tri-party agreement. any such delay or limit on our rights and remedies could adversely affect our ability to mitigate our losses and could have a material adverse effect on us.
merger and acquisition activity or consolidation in the seniors housing and healthcare industries resulting in a change of control of, or a competitor's investment in, one or more of our tenants, operators or managers could have a material adverse effect on us.
the seniors housing and healthcare industries have recently experienced increased consolidation, including among owners of real estate and care providers. we compete with other healthcare reits, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders, real estate partnerships, banks, insurance companies, private equity firms and other investors that pursue a variety of investments, which may include investments in our tenants, operators or managers. a competitor's investment in one of our tenants, operators or managers could enable our competitor to influence that tenant's, operator's or manager's business and strategy in a manner that impairs our relationship with the tenant, operator or manager or is otherwise adverse to our interests. depending on our contractual agreements and the specific facts and circumstances, we may have the right to consent to, or otherwise exercise rights and remedies, including termination rights, on account of, a competitor's investment in, a change of control of, or other transactions impacting a tenant, operator or manager. in deciding whether to exercise our rights and remedies, including termination rights, we assess numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations. in addition, in connection with any change of control of a tenant, operator or manager, the tenant's, operator's or manager's management team may change, which could lead to a change in the tenant's, operator's or manager's strategy or adversely affect the business of the tenant, operator or manager, either of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
market conditions, including, but not limited to, interest rates and credit spreads, the availability of credit and the actual and perceived state of the real estate markets and public capital markets generally could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
the markets in which we operate are affected by a number of factors that are largely beyond our control but may nevertheless have a significant negative impact on us. these factors include, but are not limited to:
•   interest rates and credit spreads;
•   the availability of credit, including the price, terms and conditions under which it can be obtained; and
•   the actual and perceived state of the real estate market, the market for dividend-paying stocks and public capital markets in general.
in addition, increased inflation may have a pronounced negative impact on the interest expense we pay in connection with our outstanding indebtedness and our general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents.
deflation may result in a decline in general price levels, often caused by a decrease in the supply of money or credit. the predominant effects of deflation are high unemployment, credit contraction and weakened consumer demand. restricted lending practices may impact our ability to obtain financing for our properties, which could adversely impact our growth and profitability.
our ongoing strategy depends, in part, upon future investments in and acquisitions of, or our development or redevelopment of, seniors housing and healthcare assets, and we may not be successful in identifying and consummating these transactions.
an important part of our business strategy is to continue to expand and diversify our portfolio through accretive acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities in domestic and international seniors housing and healthcare properties. our execution of this strategy by successfully identifying, securing and consummating beneficial transactions is made more challenging by increased competition and can be affected by many factors, including our relationships with current and prospective clients, our ability to obtain debt and equity capital at costs comparable to or better than our competitors and lower than the yield we earn on our acquisitions or investments, and our ability to negotiate favorable terms with property owners seeking to sell and other contractual counterparties. our competitors for these opportunities include other healthcare reits, real estate partnerships, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. see "business-competition" included in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. if we are unsuccessful at identifying and capitalizing on investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment opportunities, our growth and profitability may be adversely affected.
investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and healthcare properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. investments outside the united states raise legal, economic and market risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, such as currency exchange fluctuations, costly regulatory requirements and foreign tax risks. domestic and international real estate development and redevelopment projects present additional risks, including construction delays or cost overruns that increase expenses, the inability to obtain required zoning, occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis, and the incurrence of significant costs prior to completion of the project. furthermore, healthcare properties are often highly customized and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific improvements. as a result, we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities.
our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations.
we have made and expect to continue to make significant acquisitions and investments as part of our overall business strategy. our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations, including, among other things, that:
•   we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations, personnel or systems of acquired companies, maintain consistent standards, controls, policies and procedures, or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and other investments within the anticipated time frame or at all;
•   we may be unable to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties, retain key employees or attract highly qualified new employees;
•   projections of estimated future revenues, costs savings or operating metrics that we develop during the due diligence and integration planning process might be inaccurate;
•   our leverage could increase or our per share financial results could decline if we incur additional debt or issue equity securities to finance acquisitions and investments;
•   acquisitions and other new investments could divert management's attention from our existing assets;
•   the value of acquired assets or the market price of our common stock may decline; and
•   we may be unable to continue paying dividends at the current rate.
we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate acquisitions and investments without encountering difficulties or that any such difficulties will not have a material adverse effect on us.
if the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions, including indemnification obligations in favor of third parties, are greater than expected, or if there are unknown liabilities, our business could be materially and adversely affected.
we may assume or incur liabilities in connection with our acquisitions, including, in some cases, contingent liabilities. as we integrate these acquisitions, we may learn additional information about the sellers, the properties, their operations and their liabilities that adversely affects us, such as:
•   liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions;
•   unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the sellers;
•   liabilities, claims and litigation, including indemnification obligations, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to or following our acquisition;
•   claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the sellers; and
•   liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition.
as a result, we cannot assure you that our past or future acquisitions will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. among other things, if the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions are greater than expected, or if we discover obligations relating to the acquired properties or businesses of which we were not aware at the time of acquisition, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
in addition, we have now, and may have in the future, certain surviving indemnification obligations in favor of third parties under the terms of acquisition agreements to which we are a party.  most of these indemnification obligations will be capped as to amount and survival period, and we do not believe that these obligations will be material in the aggregate.  however, there can be no assurances as to the ultimate amount of such obligations or whether such obligations will have a material adverse effect on us.
our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage the expansion of our health system and research and innovation portfolios and operations following the acquisition of ahs and the research and innovation acquisition.
as a result of our acquisition of ardent medical services, inc. ("ahs") in 2015, we entered into the health system sector. also, as a result of the acquisition of substantially all of the university affiliated research and innovation real estate assets of wexford science & technology, llc ("wexford") in 2016 (the "research and innovation acquisition"), we entered into the university-affiliated research and innovation sector. part of our long-term business strategy involves expanding our health system and research and innovation portfolios through additional acquisitions and development of new properties. both the asset management of our existing health systems and university-affiliated research and innovation centers portfolios and such additional acquisitions and developments may involve complex challenges. our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage our expansion opportunities, integrate new investments into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, successfully monitor the operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality of our operators and leverage our relationships with ardent and other operators of health systems and wexford and other operators and developers of research and innovation centers. it is possible that our expansion or acquisition opportunities within the health system and research and innovation sectors will not be successful, which could adversely impact our growth and future results.
our investments are concentrated in seniors housing and healthcare real estate, making us more vulnerable economically to adverse changes in the real estate market and the seniors housing and healthcare industries than if our investments were diversified.
we invest primarily in seniors housing and healthcare properties and are constrained by the terms of our existing indebtedness from making investments outside those industries. this investment focus exposes us to greater economic risk than if our portfolio were to include real estate assets in other industries or assets unrelated to real estate.
the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and changes in government regulation and reimbursement can have material adverse consequences on its participants, some of which may be unintended. the healthcare industry is also highly competitive, and our operators and managers may encounter increased competition for residents and patients, including with respect to the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price and location. our tenants, operators and managers are large employers who compete for labor, making their results sensitive to changes in the labor market and/or wages and benefits offered to their employees. if our tenants, operators and managers are unable to successfully compete with other operators and managers by maintaining profitable occupancy and rate levels or controlling labor costs, their ability to meet their respective obligations to us may be materially adversely affected. we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the healthcare industry, including our seniors housing and healthcare operations, tenants and operators, nor can we be certain that our tenants, operators and managers will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels or labor costs levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations to us. any adverse changes in the regulation of the healthcare industry, or the competitiveness of our tenants, operators and managers, or costs of labor, could have a more pronounced effect on us than if we had investments outside the seniors housing and healthcare industries.
real estate investments are relatively illiquid, and our ability to quickly sell or exchange our properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions is limited. in the event we market any of our properties for sale, the value of those properties and our ability to sell at prices or on terms acceptable to us could be adversely affected by a downturn in the real estate industry or any economic weakness in the seniors housing and healthcare industries. in addition, transfers of healthcare properties may be subject to regulatory approvals that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial properties. we cannot assure you that we will recognize the full value of any property that we sell for liquidity or other reasons, and the inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
our operating assets expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on us.
our senior living operating assets and office assets expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, thereby reducing our profitability. these operational risks include fluctuations in occupancy levels, the inability to achieve economic resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), increases in the cost of food, materials, energy, labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise) or other services, rent control regulations, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, professional and general liability claims, and the availability and cost of professional and general liability insurance. any one or a combination of these factors could result in operating deficiencies in our senior living operations or office operations reportable business segments, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
our ownership of properties outside the united states exposes us to different risks than those associated with our domestic properties.
our current or future ownership of properties outside the united states subjects us to risks that may be different or greater than those we face with our domestic properties. these risks include, but are not limited to:
•   challenges with respect to repatriation of foreign earnings and cash;
•   foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries in which we own properties;
•   regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability;
•   challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and legal proceedings;
•   differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing; and
•   failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act.
increased construction and development in the markets in which our seniors housing communities and mobs are located could adversely affect our future occupancy rates, operating margins and profitability.
limited barriers to entry in the seniors housing and mob industries could lead to the development of new seniors housing communities or mobs that outpaces demand. data published by the national investment center for seniors housing & care has indicated deliveries of new seniors housing communities will remain at elevated levels in 2019, especially in certain geographic markets. if development outpaces demand for those assets in the markets in which our properties are located, those markets may become saturated and we could experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
we have now, and may have in the future, exposure to contingent rent escalators, which could hinder our growth and profitability.
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from leasing properties pursuant to long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates, subject to annual escalations. in certain cases, the annual escalations are contingent upon the achievement of specified revenue parameters or based on changes in cpi, with caps and floors. if, as a result of weak economic conditions or other factors, the properties subject to these leases do not generate sufficient revenue to achieve the specified rent escalation parameters or cpi does not increase, our growth and profitability may be hindered. if strong economic conditions result in significant increases in cpi, but the escalations under our leases are capped, our growth and profitability also may be limited.
we own certain properties subject to ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements that limit our uses of the properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer the properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated.
our investments in mobs and other properties may be made through leasehold interests in the land on which the buildings are located, leases of air rights for the space above the land on which the buildings are located, or other similar restrictive arrangements. many of these ground lease, air rights and other restrictive agreements impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties' value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. in addition, we could lose our interests in the subject properties if the ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements are breached by us or terminated.
we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our loans and other investments, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to successfully sell any acquired equity interests or reposition any acquired properties, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments.
if a borrower defaults under mortgage or other secured loans for which we are the lender, we may attempt to foreclose on the collateral securing those loans, including by acquiring any pledged equity interests or acquiring title to the subject properties, to protect our investment. in response, the defaulting borrower may contest our enforcement of foreclosure or other available remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other available remedies, or bring claims against us for lender liability. if a defaulting borrower seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing foreclosure or other available remedies against the borrower unless relief is first obtained from the court with jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in addition, we may be subject to intercreditor or tri-party agreements that delay, impact, govern or limit our ability to foreclose on a lien securing a loan or otherwise delay or limit our pursuit of our rights and remedies. any such delay or limit on our ability to pursue our rights or remedies could have a material adverse effect on us.
even if we successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgage loans and other investments, costs related to enforcement of our remedies, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the collateral could prevent us from realizing the full amount of our secured loans, and we could be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses. moreover, the collateral may include equity interests that we are unable to sell due to securities law restrictions or otherwise, or properties that we are unable to reposition with new tenants or operators on a timely basis, if at all, or without making improvements or repairs. any delay or costs incurred in selling or repositioning acquired collateral could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments.
some of our loan investments are subordinated to loans held by third parties.
our mezzanine loan investments are subordinated to senior secured loans held by other investors that encumber the same real estate. if a senior secured loan is foreclosed, that foreclosure would extinguish our rights in the collateral for our mezzanine loan. in order to protect our economic interest in that collateral, we would need to be prepared, on an expedited basis, to advance funds to the senior lenders in order to cure defaults under the senior secured loans and prevent such a foreclosure. if a senior secured loan has matured or has been accelerated, then in order to protect our economic interest in the collateral, we would need to be prepared, on an expedited basis, to purchase or pay off that senior secured loan, which could require an infusion of fresh capital as large or larger than our initial investment. our ability to sell or syndicate a mezzanine loan could be limited by transfer restrictions in the intercreditor agreement with the senior secured lenders. our ability to negotiate modifications to the mezzanine loan documents with our borrowers could be limited by restrictions on modifications in the intercreditor agreement. since mezzanine loans are typically secured by pledges of equity rather than direct liens on real estate, our mezzanine loan investments are more vulnerable than our mortgage loan investments to losses caused by competing creditor claims, unauthorized transfers, or bankruptcies.
our tenants, operators and managers may be adversely affected by healthcare regulation and enforcement.
regulation of the healthcare industry generally has intensified over time both in the number and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. this is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like atria, sunrise, brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred. federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include those relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers and the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of research and innovation products. in addition, changes in enforcement policies by federal and state governments have resulted in an increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs, bars on medicare and medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. see "governmental regulation-healthcare regulation" included in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. we are unable to predict the scope of future federal, state and local regulations and legislation, including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations, or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation, and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our tenants, operators and managers, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us.
if our tenants, operators and managers fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to their operations. our tenants, operators and managers also could face increased costs related to changes in healthcare regulation, such as a shift toward less comprehensive health coverage, or be forced to expend considerable resources in responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. in such event, the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers and the results of operations of our properties operated or managed by those entities could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us.
changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including insurance companies and the medicare and medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators and on us.
certain of our tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the medicare (both traditional medicare and "managed" medicare/medicare advantage) and medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. federal and state legislators and regulators have adopted or proposed various cost-containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers, and budget crises and financial shortfalls have caused states to implement or consider medicaid rate freezes or cuts. see "governmental regulation-healthcare regulation" included in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. private third-party payors also have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. in addition, coverage expansions via the aca through medicaid expansion and health insurance exchanges may be scaled back by litigation that may invalidate some or all of the aca, or waiver programs that reduce the number of people with medicaid coverage in a given state. we cannot assure you that our tenants and operators who currently depend on governmental or private payor reimbursement will be adequately reimbursed for the services they provide. significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed or on reimbursement rates and fees, whether from legislation, administrative actions or private payor efforts, could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of certain of our tenants and operators, which could affect adversely their ability to comply with the terms of our leases and have a material adverse effect on us.
the healthcare industry trend away from a traditional fee for service reimbursement model towards value-based payment approaches may negatively impact certain of our tenants' revenues and profitability.
certain of our tenants, specifically those providers in the post-acute and health system space, are subject to the broad trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services. these value-based purchasing programs include public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. medicare no longer reimburses hospitals for care related to certain preventable adverse events and imposes payment reductions on hospitals for preventable readmissions. these punitive approaches could be expanded to additional types of providers in the future.
we expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. for example, several of the nation's largest commercial payors are increasing reliance on value-based reimbursement arrangements. we are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect the revenues and profitability of those of our tenants who are providers of healthcare services; however, if this trend significantly and adversely affects their profitability, it could in turn negatively affect their ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
if controls imposed on certain of our tenants who provide healthcare services that are reimbursed by medicare, medicaid and other third-party payors to reduce admissions and length of stay affect inpatient volumes at our healthcare facilities, the financial condition or results of operations of those tenants could be adversely affected.
controls imposed by medicare, medicaid and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as "utilization reviews," have affected and are expected to continue to affect certain of our healthcare facilities, specifically our acute care hospitals and post-acute facilities. utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans. inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressures to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients. efforts to impose more stringent cost controls and reductions are expected to continue, which could negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants who provide healthcare services in our hospitals and post-acute facilities. if so, this could adversely affect these tenants' ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated health systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable, which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs.
our mob operations depend on the competitiveness and financial viability of the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients to our mobs. the viability of these hospitals, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided, competition for patients, physicians and physician groups, demographic trends in the surrounding community, market position and growth potential, as well as the ability of the affiliated health systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital. if a hospital on or near whose campus one of our mobs is located fails or becomes unable to meet its financial obligations, and if an affiliated health system is unable to support that hospital, the hospital may be unable to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate, which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients. because we rely on proximity to and affiliations with hospitals to create leasing demand in our mobs, a hospital's inability to remain competitive or financially viable, or to attract physicians and physician groups, could materially adversely affect our mob operations and have a material adverse effect on us.
our development and redevelopment projects, including projects undertaken through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns.
we consider and, when appropriate, invest in various development and redevelopment projects. in deciding whether to make an investment in a particular project, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of the property. our assumptions are subject to risks generally associated with development and redevelopment projects, including, among others, that:
•   we may be unable to obtain financing for the project on favorable terms or at all;
•   we may not complete the project on schedule or within budgeted amounts;
•   we may not be able to recognize rental revenue in some cases although cash rent is being paid and the lease has commenced;
•   we may encounter delays in obtaining or fail to obtain all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, environmental and other governmental permits and authorizations, or underestimate the costs necessary to develop or redevelop the property to market standards;
•   construction or other delays may provide tenants or residents the right to terminate preconstruction leases or cause us to incur additional costs;
•   volatility in the price of construction materials or labor may increase our project costs;
•   in the case of our mob developments, hospitals or health systems may maintain significant decision-making authority with respect to the development schedule;
•   our builders may fail to perform or satisfy the expectations of our clients or prospective clients;
•   we may incorrectly forecast risks associated with development in new geographic regions;
•   tenants may not lease space at the quantity or rental rate levels or on the schedule projected;
•   demand for our project may decrease prior to completion, due to competition from other developments; and
•   lease rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate based on factors beyond our control, including market and economic conditions.
if any of the risks described above occur, our development and redevelopment projects, including projects undertaken through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
our investments in joint ventures and unconsolidated entities could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on our joint venture partners' financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners, and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners.
as of december 31, 2019, we owned 35 mobs, 12 research and innovation centers, 38 seniors housing communities and one irf through consolidated joint ventures, and we had 25% ownership interests in five seniors housing communities and one mob through investments in unconsolidated entities. in addition, we had a 34% ownership interest in atria, a 34% ownership interest in eclipse senior living and a 9.8% interest in ardent as of december 31, 2019. these joint ventures and unconsolidated entities involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following:
•   we may be unable to take actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners under arrangements that require us to share decision-making authority over major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and any property owned by the joint venture, such as the sale or financing of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property;
•   for joint ventures in which we have a noncontrolling interest, our joint venture partners may take actions that we oppose;
•   our ability to sell or transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted if we fail to obtain the prior consent of our joint venture partners;
•   our joint venture partners may become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which could delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture;
•   our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to a property that conflict with our business interests and goals, including with respect to the timing, terms and strategies for investment, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the property;
•   disagreements with our joint venture partners could result in litigation or arbitration that increases our expenses, distracts our officers and directors, and disrupts the day-to-day operations of the property, including by delaying important decisions until the dispute is resolved; and
•   we may suffer losses as a result of actions taken by our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments.
events that adversely affect the ability of seniors and their families to afford daily resident fees at our seniors housing communities could cause our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations to decline.
assisted and independent living services generally are not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs, such as medicare and medicaid. a large majority of the resident fee revenues generated by our senior living operations, therefore, are derived from private pay sources consisting of the income or assets of residents or their family members. in light of the significant expense associated with building new properties and staffing and other costs of providing services, typically only seniors with income or assets that meet or exceed the comparable region median can afford the daily resident and care fees at our seniors housing communities, and a weak economy, depressed housing market or changes in demographics could adversely affect their continued ability to do so. if the managers of our seniors housing communities are unable to attract and retain seniors that have sufficient income, assets or other resources to pay the fees associated with assisted and independent living services, the occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations of our senior living operations could decline, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us.
our tenants in the research and innovation industry face high levels of regulation, expense and uncertainty.
research and innovation tenants, particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products, are subject to certain unique risks, including the following:
•   some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research and development and clinical testing of their products and technologies. the economic environment in recent years has significantly impacted the ability of these companies to access the capital markets and venture capital funding. in addition, state and federal government and university budgets have been negatively impacted by the recent economic environment and, as a result certain programs, including grants related to biotechnology research and development, may be at risk of being eliminated or cut back significantly. if private investors, the government, universities, public markets or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such development, a tenant's business may fail.
•   the research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants' products require federal, state and foreign regulatory approvals. the approval process is typically long, expensive and uncertain. even if our tenants have sufficient funds to seek approvals, one or all of their products may fail to obtain the required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all. furthermore, our tenants may only have a small number of products under development. if one product fails to receive the required approvals at any stage of development, it could significantly adversely affect our tenant's entire business and its ability to pay rent.
•   our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent, copyright or trade secret laws. failure to do so could jeopardize their ability to profit from their efforts and to protect their products from competition.
•   collaborative relationships with other research and innovation entities may be crucial to the development, manufacturing, distribution or marketing of our tenants' products. if these other entities fail to fulfill their obligations under these collaborative arrangements, our tenants' businesses will suffer.
•   legislation to reform the u.s. healthcare system, including regulations and legislation relating to the aca, may include government intervention in product pricing and other changes that adversely affect reimbursement for our tenants' marketable products. in addition, sales of many of our tenants' marketable products are dependent, in large part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. changes in government regulations, price controls or third-party payors' reimbursement policies may reduce reimbursement for our tenants' marketable products and adversely impact our tenants' businesses.
we cannot assure you that our tenants in the research and innovation industry will be successful in their businesses. if our tenants' businesses are adversely affected, they may have difficulty making payments to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers may not adequately insure against losses.
we maintain or require in our lease, management and other agreements that our tenants, operators and managers maintain all applicable lines of insurance on our properties and their operations. although we regularly review the amount and scope of insurance provided by our policies and required to be maintained by our tenants, operators and managers and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry, we cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators and managers will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance. we also cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators and managers will maintain the required coverages, that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance under our lease, management and other agreements, that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the policies maintained will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event, nor can we make any guaranty as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers.
for various reasons, including to reduce and manage costs, many healthcare companies utilize different organizational and corporate structures coupled with self-insurance trusts or captive programs that may provide less insurance coverage than a traditional insurance policy. companies that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of general and professional liability through actuarial studies that rely primarily on historical data. however, due to the rise in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims, and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. as a result, the tenants and operators of our properties who self-insure could incur large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. if we or the managers of our senior living operations decide to implement a captive or self-insurance program, any large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses incurred could have a material adverse effect on us.
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could incur substantial liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. following the occurrence of such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future.
damage from catastrophic weather and other natural events and the physical effects of climate change could result in losses to the company.
certain of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by catastrophic weather and other natural events, including fires, snow or ice storms, windstorms or hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding or other severe weather. these adverse weather and natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed our or our tenants', operators' and managers' property insurance coverage. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected property, as well as anticipated future revenue from that property. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations. climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable.
to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our properties are located, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. should the impact of climate change be material in nature, including destruction of our properties, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.
in addition, changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue.
the decision of the united kingdom to exit the european union could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in 2019, we derived 1.3% of our noi from the united kingdom. the decision made in the british referendum of june 23, 2016 to leave the european union, commonly referred to as "brexit," has led to volatility in the financial markets of the united kingdom (the "u.k."), and more broadly across europe and may also lead to weakening in consumer, corporate and financial confidence in such markets. the u.k. government initiated the official eu withdrawal process on march 29, 2017, and the exit from the eu was expected to occur by the end of march 2019. however, the withdrawal was extended several times due to deadlock in negotiations. on january 29, 2020, the u.k. parliament approved a withdrawal agreement submitted on january 22, 2020, and the u.k. officially withdrew from the eu on january 31, 2020. there is a transition period through december 2020, with an option to extend an additional one to two years, to allow for businesses and individuals to adjust to its changes, during which all eu regulations will continue to apply to the u.k. trade negotiations are expected to begin in early march 2020, but the nature of the economic relationship between the eu and u.k. remains uncertain, and there is no guarantee that both parties will be able to reach an agreement before the transition period expires. this brexit decision has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the u.k. and the eu, and this uncertainty may last for years. our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of the u.k. referendum. in addition, our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the u.k. and other countries, including the u.s., and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the u.k. these possible negative impacts, and others resulting from the u.k.'s withdrawal from the eu, could adversely affect our and our tenants' businesses, financial conditions and results of operations.
significant legal actions or regulatory proceedings could subject us or our tenants, operators and managers to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
from time to time, we may be subject to claims brought against us in lawsuits and other legal or regulatory proceedings arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants, operators and managers for which such tenants, operators and managers may have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless. an unfavorable resolution of any such litigation or proceeding could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and have a material adverse effect on us.
in certain cases, we and our tenants, operators and managers may be subject to professional liability claims brought by plaintiffs' attorneys seeking significant punitive damages and attorneys' fees. due to the historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against seniors housing and healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has decreased and the premiums on such insurance coverage remain costly. as a result, insurance protection against such claims may not be sufficient to cover all claims against us or our tenants, operators or managers, and may not be available at a reasonable cost. if we or our tenants, operators and managers are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, we or they may be exposed to substantial liabilities.
the occurrence of cyber incidents could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of confidential information and/or damage our business relationships and reputation.
as our reliance on technology has increased, our business is subject to greater risk from cyber incidents, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our or our managers' systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information, and other electronic security breaches. while we and our managers have implemented measures to help mitigate these threats, such measures cannot guarantee that we will be successful in preventing a cyber incident. the occurrence of a cyber incident could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our managers, compromise the confidential information of our employees or the residents in our seniors housing communities, and/or damage our business relationships and reputation.
our operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute.
our operators who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. see "governmental regulation-healthcare regulation" included in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. these lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. if any of these lawsuits were brought against our operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and on their ability to satisfy their obligations under our leases, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us.
we could incur substantial liabilities and costs if any of our properties are found to be contaminated with hazardous substances or we become involved in any environmental disputes.
under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. in certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former operator of the property. although we generally have indemnification rights against the current operators of our properties for contamination caused by them, such indemnification may not adequately cover all environmental costs. see "governmental regulation-environmental regulation" included in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k.
our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business.
the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our key officers and employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us.
failure to maintain effective internal controls could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of such control. because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud, effective internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatement and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting and our operating internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls as a result of changes to our business or otherwise, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations.
economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic locations to which a greater percentage of our noi is attributed could adversely affect our financial results.
for the year ended december 31, 2019, approximately 34.8% of our total noi was derived from properties located in california (13.8%), new york (6.4%), texas (5.9%), illinois (4.6%) and pennsylvania (4.1%). as a result, we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions, including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions, increased construction and competition or decreased demand for our properties, regional climate events and changes in state-specific legislation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
our ownership of properties in canada and the united kingdom currently subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rates between u.s. dollars and canadian dollars or the british pound, which may, from time to time, impact our financial condition and results of operations. if we continue to expand our international presence through investments in, or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing or healthcare assets outside the united states, canada or the united kingdom, we may transact business in other foreign currencies. although we may pursue hedging alternatives, including borrowing in local currencies, to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us.
risks arising from our capital structure we may become more leveraged.
as of december 31, 2019, we had approximately $12.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness. the instruments governing our existing indebtedness permit us to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, and we may satisfy our capital and liquidity needs through additional borrowings. a high level of indebtedness would require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business strategy and make distributions to stockholders. a high level of indebtedness could also have the following consequences:
•   potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate or healthcare industries;
•   potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing to execute on our business strategy; and
•   potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among other things, limiting our access to capital and increasing our cost of borrowing.
in addition, from time to time, we mortgage certain of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness. if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, then the encumbered properties could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a resulting loss of income and asset value.
we are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective.
we receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing assets under long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates subject to annual escalations, while certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest and related payments that vary with the movement of libor, bankers' acceptance or other indexes. the generally fixed rate nature of a significant portion of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our debt obligations create interest rate risk. although our operating assets provide a partial hedge against interest rate fluctuations, if interest rates rise, the costs of our existing floating rate debt and any new debt that we incur would increase. these increased costs could reduce our profitability, impair our ability to meet our debt obligations, or increase the cost of financing our acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity. an increase in interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing debt upon maturity or cause us to pay higher rates upon refinancing, as well as decrease the amount that third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to promptly reposition our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions.
we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility with hedging arrangements that involve additional risks, including the risks that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits, and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than otherwise would be the case. moreover, no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
changes in the method pursuant to which the libor rates are determined and potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may affect our financial results.
libor and certain other interest "benchmarks" may be subject to regulatory guidance and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. the united kingdom's financial conduct authority, which regulates libor, has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor rates after 2021, and it is unclear if libor will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating libor will evolve. while there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor, the alternative reference rates committee, a steering committee comprised of u.s. financial market participants, selected the secured overnight finance rate ("sofr") as an alternative to libor. sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash in the overnight u.s. treasury repo market, and the federal reserve bank of new york started to publish the sofr in may 2018. at this time, it is impossible to predict whether the sofr or another reference rate will become an accepted alternative to libor. the discontinuation, reform or replacement of libor or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets, and could have an adverse effect on libor-based interest rates on our current or future debt obligations.
limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy.
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to meet our debt service obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy, if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to satisfy these needs, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. although we believe that we have sufficient access to capital and other sources of funding to meet our expected liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that conditions in the capital markets will not deteriorate or that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings and our results of operation and financial condition. if we cannot access capital at an acceptable cost or at all, we may be required to liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to maximize the return on those investments or that could result in adverse tax consequences to us.
as a public company, our access to debt and equity capital depends, in part, on the trading prices of our senior notes and common stock, which, in turn, depend upon market conditions that change from time to time, such as the market's perception of our financial condition, our growth potential and our current and expected future earnings and cash distributions. our failure to meet the market's expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions or a significant downgrade in the ratings assigned to our long-term debt could impact our ability to access capital or increase our borrowing costs. we also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facilities. if these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders.
covenants in the instruments governing our and our subsidiaries' existing indebtedness limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations.
the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness require us to comply with certain customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements. our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to our compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the applicable debt instruments and could trigger defaults under any of our other indebtedness that is cross-defaulted against such instruments, even if we satisfy our payment obligations. in addition, covenants contained in the instruments governing our subsidiaries' outstanding mortgage indebtedness may restrict our ability to obtain cash distributions from such subsidiaries for the purpose of meeting our debt service obligations. financial and other covenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from our breach of any of these covenants, could have a material adverse effect on us.
risks arising from our status as a reit loss of our status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock.
if we lose our status as a reit (currently or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to satisfy our obligations, to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to our stockholders for each of the years involved because:
•   we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to regular u.s. federal corporate income tax;
•   we could be subject to increased state and local taxes; and
•   unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified.
in addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain reit status, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code") for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, as well as new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions, may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. in order to maintain our qualification as a reit, we must satisfy a number of requirements, generally including requirements regarding the ownership of our stock, requirements regarding the composition of our assets, a requirement that at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding capital gains. although we believe that we currently qualify as a reit, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify for all future periods.
the 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions.
to comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. such distributions reduce the funds we have available to finance our investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment activity and may limit our ability to engage in transactions that are otherwise in the best interests of our stockholders.
although we do not anticipate any inability to satisfy the reit distribution requirement, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to do so. for example, timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand, or non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may prevent us from having sufficient cash or liquid assets to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement.
in the event that timing differences occur or we decide to retain cash or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, we may seek to borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements. any of these actions may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see "risks arising from our capital structure-limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy." the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in certain of these transactions.
to preserve our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation contains ownership limits with respect to our capital stock that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company.
to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation provides that if a person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 9.0% of our outstanding common stock or more than 9.9% of our outstanding preferred stock, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of the applicable limit are considered "excess shares" and are automatically deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by our board of directors. the trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the excess shares and the trustee may exercise all voting power over the excess shares. in addition, we have the right to purchase the excess shares for a price equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created the excess shares or (ii) the market price on the day we purchase the shares, but if we do not purchase the excess shares, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the shares at the direction of our board of directors. these ownership limits could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.
our use of trss is limited under the code.
under the code, no more than 20% of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss. this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss' operations and assets, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable limitation, or that such compliance will not adversely affect our business. also, our trss may not, among other things, operate or manage certain health care facilities, which may cause us to forgo investments we might otherwise make. finally, we may be subject to a 100% excise tax on the income derived from certain transactions with our trss that are not on an arm's-length basis. we believe our arrangements with our trss are on arm's-length terms and intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid application of that tax.
the tax imposed on reits engaging in "prohibited transactions" may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes.
a reit's net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. in general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors, such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors.
legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on our stockholders or us.
the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the u.s. treasury department. changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could adversely affect our investors or us. we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. new legislation, u.s. treasury department regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit.
the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "2017 tax act") significantly changed the u.s. federal income taxation of u.s. businesses and their owners, including reits and their stockholders. changes made by the 2017 tax act that could affect us and our stockholders include:
•   temporarily reducing individual u.s. federal income tax rates on ordinary income; the highest individual u.s. federal income tax rate has been reduced from 39.6% to 37% for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2026;
•   permanently eliminating the progressive corporate tax rate structure, which previously imposed a maximum corporate tax rate of 35%, and replacing it with a flat corporate tax rate of 21%;
•   permitting a deduction for certain pass-through business income, including dividends received by our stockholders from us that are not designated by us as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income, which will allow individuals, trusts, and estates to deduct up to 20% of such amounts for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2026;
•   reducing the highest rate of withholding with respect to our distributions to non-u.s. stockholders that are treated as attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of u.s. real property interests from 35% to 21%;
•   limiting our deduction for net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 to 80% of reit taxable income (prior to the application of the dividends paid deduction);
•   generally limiting the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of 30% of a business's "adjusted taxable income," except for taxpayers (including most equity reits) that engage in certain real estate businesses and elect out of this rule (provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system with longer depreciation periods); and
•   eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax.
many of these changes were effective immediately, without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions. the 2017 tax act is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the u.s. treasury department and irs, any of which could lessen or increase the impact of the 2017 tax act. in addition, it is unclear how these u.s. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. while some of the changes made by the 2017 tax act may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis. we continue to work with our tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the 2017 tax act as a whole will have on us.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information that management believes is relevant to an understanding and assessment of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of ventas, inc. you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, as it will help you understand:
•   our company and the environment in which we operate;
•   our 2019 highlights;
•   our critical accounting policies and estimates;
•   our results of operations for the last three years;
•   our non-gaap financial measures:
•   how we manage our assets and liabilities;

•   our cash flows; and
•   our future contractual obligations.
corporate and operating environment we are a real estate investment trust ("reit") with a highly diversified portfolio of seniors housing, research and innovation, and healthcare properties located throughout the united states, canada and the united kingdom. as of december 31, 2019, we owned approximately 1,200 properties (including properties owned through investments in unconsolidated entities and properties classified as held for sale), consisting of seniors housing communities, medical office buildings ("mobs"), research and innovation centers, inpatient rehabilitation facilities ("irfs") and long-term acute care facilities ("ltacs"), and health systems. we had 22 properties under development, including four properties that are owned by unconsolidated real estate entities. we are an s&p 500 company headquartered in chicago, illinois.
we primarily invest in seniors housing, research and innovation, and healthcare properties through acquisitions and lease our properties to unaffiliated tenants or operate them through independent third-party managers.
as of december 31, 2019, we leased a total of 412 properties (excluding properties within our office operations reportable business segment) to various healthcare operating companies under "triple-net" or "absolute-net" leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures. our three largest tenants, brookdale senior living inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "brookdale senior living"), ardent health partners, llc (together with its subsidiaries, "ardent") and kindred healthcare, llc (formerly kindred healthcare, inc., together with its subsidiaries, "kindred") leased from us 122 properties (excluding two properties managed by brookdale senior living pursuant to long-term management agreements), 11 properties and 32 properties, respectively, as of december 31, 2019
as of december 31, 2019, pursuant to long-term management agreements, we engaged independent operators, such as atria senior living, inc. ("atria") and sunrise senior living, llc (together with its subsidiaries, "sunrise") to manage 406 seniors housing communities for us.
through our lillibridge healthcare services, inc. ("lillibridge") subsidiary and our ownership interest in pmb real estate services llc ("pmbres"), we also provide mob management, leasing, marketing, facility development and advisory services to highly rated hospitals and health systems throughout the united states. in addition, from time to time, we make secured and non-mortgage loans and other investments relating to seniors housing and healthcare operators or properties.
we conduct our operations through three reportable business segments: triple-net leased properties, senior living operations and office operations. see "note 19-segment information" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
as of december 31, 2019, our consolidated portfolio included 100% ownership interests in 1,109 properties and controlling joint venture interests in 86 properties, and we had non-controlling ownership interests in six properties through investments in unconsolidated entities. through lillibridge, we provided management and leasing services to third parties with respect to 74 mobs as of december 31, 2019.
we aim to enhance shareholder value by delivering consistent, superior total returns through a strategy of: (1) generating reliable and growing cash flows; (2) maintaining a balanced, diversified portfolio of high-quality assets; and (3) preserving our financial strength, flexibility and liquidity.
our ability to access capital in a timely and cost-effective manner is critical to the success of our business strategy because it affects our ability to satisfy existing obligations, including the repayment of maturing indebtedness, and to make future investments. factors such as general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, expectations of our potential future earnings and cash distributions, and the trading price of our common stock that are beyond our control and fluctuate over time all impact our access to and cost of external capital. for that reason, we generally attempt to match the long-term duration of our investments in real property with long-term financing through the issuance of shares of our common stock or the incurrence of long-term fixed rate debt.
2019 highlights for information regarding our 2019 highlights, see "business" in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") set forth in the accounting standards codification ("asc"), as published by the financial accounting standards board ("fasb"). gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. we base these estimates on our experience and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. however, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, we may have applied a different accounting treatment, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. we periodically reevaluate our estimates and assumptions, and in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe that the critical accounting policies described below, among others, affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. for more information regarding our critical accounting policies, see "note 2-accounting policies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control. all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation, and our net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.
gaap requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities ("vies"). a vie is broadly defined as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; and (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. we consolidate our investment in a vie when we determine that we are its primary beneficiary. we may change our original assessment of a vie upon subsequent events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that affects the characteristics or adequacy of the entity's equity investments at risk and the disposition of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary.
we identify the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both: (i) the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could be significant to the entity. we perform this analysis on an ongoing basis.
accounting for real estate acquisitions when we acquire real estate, we first make reasonable judgments about whether the transaction involves an asset or a business. our real estate acquisitions are generally accounted for as asset acquisitions as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. regardless of whether an acquisition is considered a business combination or an asset acquisition, we record the cost of the businesses or assets acquired as tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.
we estimate the fair value of buildings acquired on an as-if-vacant basis or replacement cost basis and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building, generally not to exceed 35 years. we determine the fair value of other fixed assets, such as site improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment, based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over the assets' estimated remaining useful lives as determined at the applicable acquisition date. we determine the value of land either by considering the sales prices of similar properties in recent transactions or based on internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio. we generally determine the value of construction in progress based upon the replacement cost. however, for certain acquired properties that are part of a ground-up development, we determine fair value by using the same valuation approach as for all other properties and deducting the estimated cost to complete the development. during the remaining construction period, we capitalize project costs until the development has reached substantial completion. construction in progress, including capitalized interest, is not depreciated until the development has reached substantial completion.
intangibles primarily include the value of in-place leases and acquired lease contracts. we include all lease-related intangible assets and liabilities within acquired lease intangibles and accounts payable and other liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.
the fair value of acquired lease-related intangibles, if any, reflects: (i) the estimated value of any above and/or below market leases, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated market rent and in-place lease rent; and (ii) the estimated value of in-place leases related to the cost to obtain tenants, including leasing commissions, and an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rent and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period as if the acquired space was vacant. we amortize any acquired lease-related intangibles to revenue or amortization expense over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any assumed bargain renewal periods. if a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration or not renewed upon expiration, we recognize all unamortized amounts of lease-related intangibles associated with that lease in operations at that time.
we estimate the fair value of purchase option intangible assets and liabilities, if any, by discounting the difference between the applicable property's acquisition date fair value and an estimate of its future option price. we do not amortize the resulting intangible asset or liability over the term of the lease, but rather adjust the recognized value of the asset or liability upon sale.
in connection with an acquisition, we may assume rights and obligations under certain lease agreements pursuant to which we become the lessee of a given property. we generally assume the lease classification previously determined by the prior lessee absent a modification in the assumed lease agreement. we assess assumed operating leases, including ground leases, to determine whether the lease terms are favorable or unfavorable to us given current market conditions on the acquisition date. to the extent the lease terms are favorable or unfavorable to us relative to market conditions on the acquisition date, we recognize an intangible asset or liability at fair value and amortize that asset or liability to interest or rental expense in our consolidated statements of income over the applicable lease term. where we are the lessee, we record the acquisition date values of leases, including any above or below market value, within operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
we estimate the fair value of noncontrolling interests assumed consistent with the manner in which we value all of the underlying assets and liabilities.
we calculate the fair value of long-term assumed debt by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings, which we approximate based on the rate at which we would expect to incur a replacement instrument on the date of acquisition, and recognize any fair value adjustments related to long-term debt as effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument.
impairment of long-lived and intangible assets we periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily consisting of investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. if indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. in performing this evaluation, we consider market conditions and our current intentions with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. we adjust the net book value of real estate properties and other long-lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows, including sales proceeds, is less than book value. we recognize an impairment loss at the time we make any such determination.
estimates of fair value used in our evaluation of investments in real estate are based upon discounted future cash flow projections, if necessary, or other acceptable valuation techniques that are based, in turn, upon all available evidence including level three inputs, such as revenue and expense growth rates, estimates of future cash flows, capitalization rates, discount rates, general economic conditions and trends, or other available market data. our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows and to estimate and determine fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.
revenue recognition we recognize rental revenues under our leases on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term when collectability of substantially all rents is probable. we assess the probability of collecting substantially all rents under our leases based on several factors, including, among other things, payment history, the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors, the historical operations and operating trends of the property, the historical payment pattern of the tenant, the type of property, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, expected future performance of the property and current economic conditions. if our evaluation of these factors indicates it is not probable that we will be able to collect substantially all rents, we recognize a charge to rental income. if we change our conclusions regarding the probability of collecting rent payments required by a lease, we may recognize adjustments to rental income in the period we make such change in our conclusions.
federal income tax we have elected to be treated as a reit under the applicable provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), for every year beginning with the year ended december 31, 1999. accordingly, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on net income that we distribute to our stockholders, provided that we continue to qualify as a reit. however, with respect to certain of our subsidiaries that have elected to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries ("trs" or "trs entities"), we record income tax expense or benefit, as those entities are subject to federal income tax similar to regular corporations. certain foreign subsidiaries are subject to foreign income tax, although they did not elect to be treated as trss.
we account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method and recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns. under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. any increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes us to change our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur. deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. a valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes us to change our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur.
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. we recognize interest and penalties, if applicable, related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax benefit or expense.
recently issued or adopted accounting standards we adopted asc topic 842, leases ("asc 842") on january 1, 2019, which introduced a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet and, among other changes, eliminates the requirement in current gaap for an entity to use bright-line tests in determining lease classification.
asc 842 allows for several practical expedients which permit the following: no reassessment of lease classification or initial direct costs; use of the standard's effective date as the date of initial application; and no separation of non-lease components from the related lease components and, instead, to account for those components as a single lease component if certain criteria are met. we elected these practical expedients using the effective date as our date of initial application. therefore, financial information and disclosures under asc 842 are not provided for periods prior to january 1, 2019.
upon adoption, we recognized both right of use assets and lease liabilities for leases in which we lease land, real property or other equipment. we now also report revenues and expenses within our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment for real estate taxes and insurance that are escrowed and obligations of the tenants in accordance with their respective leases with us. this reporting had no impact on our net income. resident leases within our senior living operations reportable business segment and office leases also contain service elements. we elected the practical expedient to account for our resident and office leases as a single lease component. also, we now expense certain leasing costs, other than leasing commissions, as they are incurred. prior to the adoption of asc 842, gaap provided for the deferral and amortization of such costs over the applicable lease term. we are continuing to amortize any unamortized deferred lease costs as of december 31, 2018 over their respective lease terms.
as of january 1, 2019 we recognized operating lease assets of $361.7 million on our consolidated balance sheets which includes the present value of minimum lease payments as well as certain existing above and/or below market lease intangible values associated with such leases. also upon adoption, we recognized operating lease liabilities of $216.9 million on our consolidated balance sheets. the present value of minimum lease payments was calculated on each lease using a discount rate that approximates our incremental borrowing rate primarily adjusted for the length of the individual lease terms. as of the january 1, 2019 adoption date, we utilized discount rates ranging from 6.15% to 7.60% for our ground leases.
upon adoption, we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $0.6 million primarily relating to certain costs associated with unexecuted leases that were deferred as of december 31, 2018.
results of operations as of december 31, 2019, we operated through three reportable business segments: triple-net leased properties, senior living operations and office operations. in our triple-net leased properties segment, we invest in and own seniors housing and healthcare properties throughout the united states and the united kingdom and lease those properties to healthcare operating companies under "triple-net" or "absolute-net" leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses. in our senior living operations segment, we invest in seniors housing communities throughout the united states and canada and engage independent operators, such as atria and sunrise, to manage those communities. in our office operations segment, we primarily acquire, own, develop, lease and manage mobs and research and innovation centers throughout the united states. information provided for "all other" includes income from loans and investments and other miscellaneous income and various corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of our three reportable business segments. assets included in "all other" consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments, and miscellaneous accounts receivable.
our chief operating decision makers evaluate performance of the combined properties in each reportable business segment and determine how to allocate resources to those segments, in significant part, based on segment net operating income ("noi") and related measures. for further information regarding our business segments and a discussion of our definition of segment noi, see "note 19-segment information" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. see "non-gaap financial measures" included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional disclosure and reconciliations of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with gaap, to noi.

in our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment, our revenues generally consist of fixed rental amounts (subject to annual contractual escalations) received from our tenants in accordance with the applicable lease terms.
pursuant to our adoption of asc 842 on january 1, 2019, we now report revenues and property-level operating expenses within our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment for real estate tax and insurance expenses that are paid from escrows collected from our tenants. for further information regarding our adoption of asc 842, see "note 2-accounting policies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
triple-net leased properties segment noi increased in 2019 over the prior year primarily due to the second quarter 2018 non-cash expense of $21.3 million related to the brookdale senior living lease extensions and net increases in rent, partially offset by fewer assets in the portfolio due to dispositions and operator transitions of seniors housing communities from triple-net leased properties to senior living operations.
occupancy rates may affect the profitability of our tenants' operations. the following table sets forth average continuing occupancy rates related to the triple-net leased properties we owned at december 31, 2019 for the trailing 12 months ended september 30, 2019 (which is the most recent information available to us from our tenants) and average continuing occupancy rates related to the triple-net leased properties we owned at december 31, 2018 for the 12 months ended september 30, 2018. the table excludes non-stabilized properties, properties owned through investments in unconsolidated entities, certain properties for which we do not receive occupancy information and properties acquired or properties that transitioned operators for which we do not have a full four quarters of occupancy results.

the increase in our senior living operations segment noi in 2019 over the prior year is attributable primarily to the acquisition of an 87% interest in 34 canadian seniors housing communities (including five in-process developments) valued at $1.8 billion through an equity partnership (the "lgm acquisition") with le groupe maurice ("lgm"), partially offset by decreases in occupancy and increases in property-level operating expenses.

segment that are considered materially disruptive will be excluded from the same-store pool until they meet the definition for subsequent inclusion. if this policy had been in place for 2019, same-store senior living operations results would have been based on same-store communities of 334 while the year-over-year change in same-store segment noi would have remained substantially unchanged at (3.9%).

the increase in our same-store office operations segment noi in 2019 over the prior year is attributable primarily to increases in occupancy.
all other information provided for all other segment noi includes income from loans and investments and other miscellaneous income not directly attributable to any of our three reportable business segments. the $34.9 million decrease in all other segment noi in 2019 over the prior year is primarily due to reduced income related to the $700.0 million term loan that we made to ardent in march 2017, which was fully repaid in june 2018, partially offset by increased 2019 investment activity. see "note 6-loans receivable and investments" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
interest and other income the $13.9 million decrease in interest and other income in 2019 over the prior year is primarily due to a $12.3 million fee received in the third quarter of 2018 related to certain 2018 kindred transactions. see "note 3-concentration of credit risk" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
interest expense the $9.2 million increase in total interest expense in 2019 over the prior year is primarily attributable to an increase of $17.9 million due to higher debt balances and decreased capitalized interest, partially offset by a decrease of $10.7 million due to a lower effective interest rate. our weighted average effective interest rate was 3.8% for 2019, compared to 3.9% for 2018. capitalized interest for 2019 and 2018 was $9.0 million and $10.9 million, respectively.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense related to continuing operations increased during 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to real estate impairments and asset acquisitions, net of dispositions.
loss on extinguishment of debt, net the loss on extinguishment of debt, net in 2019 was due primarily to the redemption and repayment of $600.0 million aggregate principal amounts then outstanding of our 4.25% senior notes due 2022. the loss on extinguishment of debt, net in 2018 was due primarily to the redemption and repayment of $1.3 billion aggregate principal amounts then outstanding of our 4.00% senior notes due 2019 and our 4.75% senior notes due 2021.
merger-related expenses and deal costs the $15.3 million decrease in merger-related expenses and deal costs in 2019 over the prior year was due primarily to costs associated with the 2018 transition of the management of 76 private pay seniors housing communities to eclipse senior living.
other the $84.4 million change in other for 2019 over 2018 is primarily due to 2019 property insurance recoveries related to natural disasters in addition to 2018 impairments and expenses related to natural disasters.
loss from unconsolidated entities the $52.6 million decrease in loss from unconsolidated entities for 2019 over 2018 is primarily due to our share of improved financial results from our unconsolidated entities in 2019 and a $35.7 million impairment in 2018 relating to the carrying costs of one of our equity method investments consisting principally of snfs.
gain on real estate dispositions the $20.2 million decrease in gain on real estate dispositions for 2019 over 2018 is due primarily to higher disposition activity in 2018.
income tax benefit the $16.4 million increase in income tax benefit related to continuing operations for 2019 over 2018 is primarily due to a $57.6 million reversal of valuation allowances recorded against the net deferred tax assets of certain of our taxable reit subsidiaries in the second quarter of 2019, partially offset by the reversal of a valuation allowance on deferred interest carryforwards in the fourth quarter of 2018. the $23.3 million valuation allowance reversal recorded in 2018 was an adjustment to the provisional amount recorded in the prior year related to enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and was made based upon additional guidance issued by the internal revenue service subsequent to enactment.
years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017
our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018, filed with the sec on february 8, 2019, contains information regarding our results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 and the effect of changes in those results from period to period on our net income attributable to common stockholders.
non-gaap financial measures we consider certain non-gaap financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. a non-gaap financial measure is a measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not so excluded from or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap. described below are the non-gaap financial measures used by management to evaluate our operating performance and that we consider most useful to investors, together with reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures.
the non-gaap financial measures we present in this annual report on form 10-k may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. you should not consider these measures as alternatives to net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with gaap) as indicators of our financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with gaap) as measures of our liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, you should examine these measures in conjunction with net income attributable to common stockholders as presented in our consolidated financial statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
funds from operations and normalized funds from operations historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. however, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. for that reason, we consider funds from operations ("ffo") and normalized ffo to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity reit. in particular, we believe that normalized ffo is useful because it allows investors, analysts and our management to compare our operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. in some cases, we provide information about identified non-cash components of ffo and normalized ffo because it allows investors, analysts and our management to assess the impact of those items on our financial results.
we use the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") definition of ffo. nareit defines ffo as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property, including gains or losses on re-measurement of equity method investments, and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis. we define normalized ffo as ffo excluding the following income and expense items (which may be recurring in nature): (a) merger-related costs and expenses, including amortization of intangibles, transition and integration expenses, and deal costs and expenses, including expenses and recoveries relating to acquisition lawsuits; (b) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of our debt; (c) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses, the non-cash impact of changes to our executive equity compensation plan, derivative transactions that have non-cash mark-to-market impacts on our consolidated statements of income and non-cash charges related to lease terminations; (d) the financial impact of contingent consideration, severance-
related costs and charitable donations made to the ventas charitable foundation; (e) gains and losses for non-operational foreign currency hedge agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (f) gains and losses on non-real estate dispositions and other unusual items related to unconsolidated entities; (g) expenses related to the re-audit and re-review in 2014 of our historical financial statements and related matters; and (h) net expenses or recoveries related to natural disasters.
the following table summarizes our ffo and normalized ffo for each of the five years ended december 31, 2019. the decrease in normalized ffo for the year ended december 31, 2019 over the prior year is due primarily to the $12.3 million fee received in the third quarter of 2018 related to certain 2018 kindred transactions and 2018 loan repayments and fees.

adjusted ebitda we consider adjusted ebitda an important supplemental measure because it provides another manner in which to evaluate our operating performance and serves as another indicator of our credit strength and our ability to service our debt obligations. we define adjusted ebitda as consolidated earnings, which includes amounts in discontinued operations, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (including non-cash stock-based compensation expense), excluding gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, our consolidated joint venture partners' share of ebitda, merger-related expenses and deal costs, expenses related to the re-audit and re-review in 2014 of our historical financial statements, net gains or losses on real estate activity, gains or losses on re-measurement of equity interest upon acquisition, changes in the fair value of financial instruments, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, net expenses or recoveries related to natural disasters and non-cash charges related to lease terminations, and including our share of ebitda from unconsolidated entities and adjustments for other immaterial or identified items.  the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to adjusted ebitda:

see "results of operations" for discussions regarding both segment noi and same-store segment noi. we define same-store as properties owned, consolidated and operational for the full period in both comparison periods and are not otherwise excluded; provided, however, that we may include selected properties that otherwise meet the same-store criteria if they are included in substantially all of, but not a full, period for one or both of the comparison periods, and in our judgment such inclusion provides a more meaningful presentation of our portfolio performance. same-store excludes: (i) properties sold or classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with gaap; (ii) for properties included in our office operations reportable business segment, those properties for which management has an intention to institute a redevelopment plan because the properties may require major property-level expenditures to maximize value, increase noi, maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization; and (iii) for other assets, those properties (a) that have transitioned operators or business models after the start of the prior comparison period or (b) for which an operator or business model transition has been scheduled after the start of the prior comparison period.  newly-developed properties in the office operations and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments will be included in same-store if in service for the full period in both periods presented. to eliminate the impact of exchange rate movements, all same-store noi measures assume constant exchange rates across comparable periods, using the following methodology: the current period's results are shown in actual reported usd, while prior comparison period's results are adjusted and converted to usd based on the average exchange rate for the current period.
asset/liability management asset/liability management, a key element of enterprise risk management, is designed to support the achievement of our business strategy, while ensuring that we maintain appropriate and tolerable levels of market risk (primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk) and credit risk. effective management of these risks is a contributing factor to the absolute levels and variability of our ffo and net worth. the following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments.
market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates with respect to borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our unsecured term loans, certain of our mortgage loans that are floating rate obligations, mortgage loans receivable that bear interest at floating rates and available for sale securities. these market risks result primarily from changes in libor rates or prime rates. to manage these risks, we continuously monitor our level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including our assessment of current and future economic conditions.
the table below sets forth certain information with respect to our debt, excluding premiums and discounts.

(1)   excludes mortgage debt of $57.4 million related to real estate assets classified as held for sale as of december 31, 2017 which was included in liabilities related to assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet.
the variable rate debt in the table above reflects, in part, the effect of $147.8 million notional amount of interest rate swaps with maturities ranging from march 2022 to may 2022, in each case that effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. in addition, the fixed rate debt in the table above reflects, in part, the effect of $505.1 million and c$119.8 million notional amount of interest rate swaps with maturities ranging from august 2020 to december 2029, in each case that effectively convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. see "note 10-senior notes payable and other debt" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
the increase in our outstanding variable rate debt at december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to the assumption of mortgage debt related to the lgm acquisition and our november 2019 issuance of floating rate senior notes.
assuming a 100 basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate related to our variable rate debt and assuming no change in our variable rate debt outstanding as of december 31, 2019, interest expense on an annualized basis would increase by approximately $19.2 million, or $0.05 per diluted common share.
as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, our joint venture partners' aggregate share of total debt was $228.2 million and $100.9 million, respectively, with respect to certain properties we owned through consolidated joint ventures. total debt does not include our portion of debt related to investments in unconsolidated entities, which was $60.6 million and $40.8 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
the fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which we could obtain similar borrowings. for fixed rate debt, interest rate fluctuations generally affect the fair value, but not our earnings or cash flows. therefore, interest rate risk does not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt obligations until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing. if interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt, whether at maturity or otherwise, our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs. conversely, lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs.
to highlight the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points in interest rates:

the change in fair value of our fixed rate debt from december 31, 2018 to december 31, 2019 was due primarily to 2019 senior note issuances, net of repayments, and the assumption of mortgage debt related to the lgm acquisition.
as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of our secured and non-mortgage loans receivable, based on our estimates of currently prevailing rates for comparable loans, was $710.5 million and $479.4 million, respectively. see "note 6-loans receivable and investments" and "note 11-fair values of financial instruments" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
as a result of our canadian and united kingdom operations, we are subject to fluctuations in certain foreign currency exchange rates that may, from time to time, affect our financial condition and operating performance. based solely on our results for the year ended december 31, 2019 (including the impact of existing hedging arrangements), if the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the british pound and canadian dollar were to increase or decrease by one standard deviation compared to the average exchange rate during the year, our normalized ffo per share for the year ended december 31, 2019 would decrease or increase, as applicable, by less than $0.01 per share or 0.1%. we will continue to mitigate these risks through a layered approach to hedging looking out for the next year and continual assessment of our foreign operational capital structure. nevertheless, we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have an effect on our earnings.
concentration and credit risk we use concentration ratios to identify, understand and evaluate the potential impact of economic downturns and other adverse events that may affect our asset types, geographic locations, business models, and tenants, operators and managers. we evaluate concentration risk in terms of investment mix and operations mix. investment mix measures the percentage of our investments that is concentrated in a specific asset type or that is operated or managed by a particular tenant, operator or manager. operations mix measures the percentage of our operating results that is attributed to a particular tenant, operator or manager, geographic location or business model. the following tables reflect our concentration risk as of the dates and for the periods presented:

we derive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing assets under long-term triple-net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators, subject to certain limitations. some of our triple-net lease escalators are contingent upon the satisfaction of specified facility revenue parameters or based on increases in the consumer price index ("cpi"), with caps, floors or collars. we also earn revenues directly from individual residents in our seniors housing communities that are managed by independent operators, such as atria and sunrise, and tenants in our office buildings. for the year ended december 31, 2019, 60.3% of our adjusted ebitda (including amounts in discontinued operations) was derived from our senior living operations and office operations, for which rental rates may fluctuate more frequently upon lease rollovers and renewals due to shorter term leases and changing economic or market conditions.
the concentration of our triple-net leased properties segment revenues and operating income that are attributed to brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred creates credit risk. if any of brookdale senior living, ardent or kindred becomes unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations to us or to renew its leases with us upon expiration of the terms thereof, our financial condition and results of operations could decline, and our ability to service our indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders could be impaired. see "risk factors-risks arising from our business-our leases and other agreements with brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living, ardent or kindred to satisfy its obligations under our agreements could have a material adverse effect on us" included in part i, item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k and "note 3-concentration of credit risk" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
we regularly monitor and assess any changes in the relative credit risk of our significant tenants, and in particular those tenants that have recourse obligations under our triple-net leases. the ratios and metrics we use to evaluate a significant tenant's liquidity and creditworthiness depend on facts and circumstances specific to that tenant and the industry or industries in which it operates, including without limitation the tenant's credit history and economic conditions related to the tenant, its operations and the markets in which the tenant operates, that may vary over time. among other things, we may (i) review and analyze information regarding the real estate, seniors housing and healthcare industries generally, publicly available information regarding the significant tenant, and information required to be provided by the tenant under the terms of its lease agreements with us, (ii) examine monthly and/or quarterly financial statements of the significant tenant to the extent publicly available or otherwise provided under the terms of our lease agreements, and (iii) participate in periodic discussions and in-person meetings with representatives of the significant tenant.  using this information, we calculate multiple financial ratios (which may, but do not necessarily, include leverage, fixed charge coverage and tangible net worth), after making certain adjustments based on our judgment, and assess other metrics we deem relevant to an understanding of the significant tenant's credit risk.
because atria and sunrise manage our properties in exchange for the receipt of a management fee from us, we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of our managers in the same manner or to the same extent as our triple-net tenants. however, we rely on our managers' personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations efficiently and effectively. we also rely on atria and sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financials results in a timely manner and otherwise operate our seniors housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, including various rights to terminate and exercise remedies under the agreements as provided therein, atria's or sunrise's failure, inability or unwillingness to satisfy its respective obligations under those agreements, to efficiently and effectively manage our properties or to provide timely and accurate accounting information with respect thereto could have a material adverse effect on us. see "risk factors-risks arising from our business-the properties managed by atria and sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; adverse developments in atria's and sunrise's business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us" and "-we have rights to terminate our management agreements with atria and sunrise in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances, and we may be unable to replace atria or sunrise if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed" included in part i, item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k.
our 34% ownership interests in atria entitles us to customary rights and minority protections, including the right to appoint two of six members to the atria board of directors.
triple-net lease performance and expirations any failure, inability or unwillingness by our tenants to satisfy their obligations under our triple-net leases could have a material adverse effect on us. also, if our tenants are not able or willing to renew our triple-net leases upon expiration, we may be unable to reposition the applicable properties on a timely basis or on the same or better economic terms, if at all. although our lease expirations are staggered, the non-renewal of some or all of our triple-net leases that expire in any given year could have a material adverse effect on us. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we had no triple-net lease renewals or expirations without renewal that, in the aggregate, had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations for that period. see "risk factors-risks arising from our business-if we must replace any of our tenants or operators, we might be unable to reposition the properties on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on us" included in part i, item ia of this annual report on form 10-k.

liquidity and capital resources during 2019, our principal sources of liquidity were cash flows from operations, proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities, borrowings under our commercial paper program, proceeds from asset sales and cash on hand.
for the next 12 months, our principal liquidity needs are to: (i) fund operating expenses; (ii) meet our debt service requirements; (iii) repay maturing mortgage and other debt; (iv) fund acquisitions, investments and commitments and any development and redevelopment activities; (v) fund capital expenditures; and (vi) make distributions to our stockholders and unitholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a reit. we expect that these liquidity needs generally will be satisfied by a combination of the following: cash flows from operations, cash on hand, debt assumptions and financings (including secured financings), issuances of debt and equity securities, dispositions of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program. however, an inability to access liquidity through multiple capital sources concurrently could have a material adverse effect on us. see "risk factors-risks arising from our capital structure-limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy" included in part i, item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k.
see "note 10-senior notes payable and other debt" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information regarding our significant financing activities.
credit facilities, commercial paper and unsecured term loans our unsecured credit facility is comprised of a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility priced at libor plus 0.875%, as of december 31, 2019. the unsecured revolving credit facility matures in 2021, but may be extended at our option subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions for two additional periods of six months each. the unsecured revolving credit facility also includes an accordion feature that permits us to increase our aggregate borrowing capacity thereunder to up to $3.75 billion.
in january 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary, ventas realty, limited partnership ("ventas realty"), established an unsecured commercial paper program. under the terms of the program, we may issue from time to time unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1 billion. the notes are sold under customary terms in the united states commercial paper note market and are ranked pari passu with all of ventas realty's other unsecured senior indebtedness. the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ventas, inc. as of december 31, 2019, $567.5 million was outstanding under our commercial paper program.
as of december 31, 2019, $120.8 million was outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility with an additional $24.0 million restricted to support outstanding letters of credit. in addition, we limit our utilization of the unsecured revolving credit facility in order to maintain liquidity and to support our commercial paper program. including these internal limits, we had $2.3 billion in available liquidity under the unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2019.
as of december 31, 2019, we had a $200.0 million unsecured term loan priced at libor plus 0.90% that matures in 2023.  the term loan also includes an accordion feature that effectively permits us to increase our aggregate borrowings thereunder to up to $800.0 million.
as of december 31, 2019, we had a $400.0 million secured revolving construction credit facility with $160.5 million of borrowings outstanding. the secured revolving construction credit facility matures in 2022 and is primarily used to finance the development of research and innovation centers and other construction projects.
as of december 31, 2019, we had a c$500 million unsecured term loan facility priced at canadian dollar offered rate ("cdor") plus 0.90% that matures in 2025.
senior notes as of december 31, 2019, we had outstanding $7.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by ventas realty ($500.0 million of which was co-issued by ventas realty's wholly owned subsidiary, ventas capital corporation), approximately $75.2 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by nationwide health properties, inc. ("nhp") and assumed by our subsidiary, nationwide health properties, llc ("nhp llc"), as successor to nhp, in connection with our acquisition of nhp, and c$1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by our subsidiary, ventas canada finance limited ("ventas canada"). all of the senior notes issued by ventas realty and ventas canada are unconditionally guaranteed by ventas, inc.
we may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding senior notes for cash or in exchange for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, prospects for future access to capital and other factors. the amounts involved may be material.
the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes require us to comply with various financial and other restrictive covenants. we were in compliance with all of these covenants at december 31, 2019.
mortgages at december 31, 2019 and 2018, our consolidated aggregate principal amount of mortgage debt outstanding was $2.0 billion and $1.1 billion, of which our share was $1.8 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.
under certain circumstances, contractual and legal restrictions, including those contained in the instruments governing our subsidiaries' outstanding mortgage indebtedness, may restrict our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries for the purpose of meeting our debt service obligations, including our payment guarantees with respect to ventas realty's and ventas canada finance limited's senior notes.
derivatives and hedging in the normal course of our business, interest rate fluctuations affect future cash flows under our variable rate debt obligations, loans receivable and marketable debt securities, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our operating results. we follow established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative instruments, to mitigate the impact of these risks.
dividends in order to continue to qualify as a reit, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of our reit taxable income (excluding net capital gain). in addition, we will be subject to income tax at the regular corporate rate to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our reit taxable income, including any net capital gains. we intend to pay dividends greater than 100% of our taxable income, after the use of any net operating loss carryforwards, for 2020.
we expect that our cash flows will exceed our reit taxable income due to depreciation and other non-cash deductions in computing reit taxable income and that we will be able to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. however, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to meet this requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. if we do not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements or any combination of the foregoing.
capital expenditures the terms of our triple-net leases generally obligate our tenants to pay all capital expenditures necessary to maintain and improve our triple-net leased properties. however, from time to time, we may fund the capital expenditures for our triple-net leased properties through loans or advances to the tenants, which may increase the amount of rent payable with respect to the properties in certain cases. we may also fund capital expenditures for which we may become responsible upon expiration of our triple-net leases or in the event that our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under those leases. we also expect to fund capital expenditures related to our senior living operations and office operations reportable business segments with the cash flows from the properties or through additional borrowings. we expect that these liquidity needs generally will be satisfied by a combination of the following: cash flows from operations, cash on hand, debt assumptions and financings (including secured financings), issuances of debt and equity securities, dispositions of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities.
to the extent that unanticipated capital expenditure needs arise or significant borrowings are required, our liquidity may be affected adversely. our ability to borrow additional funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness.
we are party to certain agreements that obligate us to develop seniors housing or healthcare properties funded through capital that we and, in certain circumstances, our joint venture partners provide. as of december 31, 2019, we had 22 properties under development pursuant to these agreements, including four properties that are owned by unconsolidated real estate entities. in addition, from time to time, we engage in redevelopment projects with respect to our existing seniors housing communities to maximize the value, increase noi, maintain a market-competitive position, achieve property stabilization or change the primary use of the property.
equity offerings from time to time, we may sell our common stock under an "at-the-market" equity offering program ("atm program"). in august 2018, we replaced our expired atm program with an identical program, under which we may sell up to an aggregate of $1.0 billion of our common stock.
in june 2019, we sold 12.7 million shares of our common stock under a registered public offering for gross proceeds of $62.75 per share. we used the majority of the net proceeds to fund our lgm acquisition. see "note 4-acquisitions of real estate property" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding the lgm acquisition.
during the year ended december 31, 2019, we sold 2.7 million shares of our common stock under our atm program for gross proceeds of $66.75 per share. as of december 31, 2019, $822.1 million of our common stock remained available for sale under our atm program.

nm-not meaningful cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities increased $56.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2019 over the same period in 2018 due primarily to higher noi in 2019 including the impact of property acquisitions and lease-up of new developments, partially offset by asset dispositions, and lower merger-related expenses and deal costs in 2019.
cash flows from investing activities cash flows from investing activities decreased $1.9 billion during 2019 over 2018 primarily due to increased acquisition and investment activity together with decreased real estate dispositions.
cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities increased $1.9 billion during 2019 over 2018 primarily due to the 2019 issuance of common stock and increased net borrowings in 2019.

item 1a    risk factors our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows may be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to those set forth below. any one of these factors could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or future anticipated results. see also item 7. management's discussion and analysis - "executive overview of the business" and "results of operations".
global economic uncertainty could adversely affect us.
during periods of prolonged slow growth, or a downturn in conditions in the worldwide or domestic economies, we could experience reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors caused by economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers. depending upon their severity and duration, these conditions could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we operate in markets that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect selling prices or demand for our products.
we compete on the basis of product performance, quality, service and/or price. competitors' behavior related to these areas could potentially have significant impacts on our financial results. our competitive strategy is to design and manufacture high quality products at the lowest possible cost. our strategy is to also increase selling prices to offset rising costs of raw materials and components. competitive pricing pressures may not allow us to offset some or all of our increased costs through pricing actions. alternatively, if raw material and component costs decline, the company may not be able to maintain current pricing levels. competition could also affect future selling prices or demand for our products which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
our inability to effectively develop and introduce new products could adversely affect our ability to compete.
new product introductions and enhancement of existing products and services are key to the company's competitive strategy. the success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, timely and successful development of new products, including software development, market acceptance of these products and the company's ability to manage the risks associated with these introductions. these risks include development and production capabilities, management of inventory levels to support anticipated demand, the risk that new products may have quality defects in the early stages of introduction, and obsolescence risk of existing products. the company cannot predict with certainty the ultimate impact new product introductions could have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
we may not be able to successfully implement initiatives, including our restructuring activities that improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs.
achieving our long-term profitability goals depends significantly on our ability to control or reduce our operating costs. because many of our costs are affected by factors completely, or substantially outside our control, we generally must seek to control or reduce costs through productivity initiatives. if we are not able to identify and implement initiatives that control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency, or if the cost savings initiatives we have implemented to date do not generate expected cost savings, our financial results could be adversely affected. our efforts to control or reduce costs may include restructuring activities involving workforce reductions, facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits may be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted.
we engage in acquisitions and strategic investments and may encounter difficulty in obtaining appropriate acquisitions and in integrating these businesses.
part of the company's growth strategy involves acquisitions. we have pursued and will continue to seek acquisitions and other strategic investments to complement and expand our existing businesses. the rate and extent to which acquisitions become available may affect our growth rate. the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate these businesses into our operations and realize the planned synergies. we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions into our operations and in managing strategic investments and foreign acquisitions and joint ventures may also present additional risk related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages. failure to effectively complete or manage acquisitions may adversely affect our existing businesses as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the aclara acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.
the full benefits of the aclara acquisition, including the anticipated sales or growth opportunities, may not be realized as expected or may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the aclara acquisition could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows and decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the aclara acquisition.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k we have outstanding indebtedness; our indebtedness has increased as a result of the aclara acquisition, and will further increase if we incur additional indebtedness in the future and do not retire existing indebtedness.
we have outstanding indebtedness and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. the amount of cash required to service our indebtedness following completion of the aclara acquisition, and thus the demands on our cash resources, is greater than the amount of cash required to service our indebtedness prior to the aclara acquisition. our increased indebtedness level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including (i) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, (ii) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions and (iii) exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates.
we may incur significantly more indebtedness in the future. if we add new indebtedness and do not retire existing indebtedness, the risks described above could increase.
we manufacture and source products and materials from various countries throughout the world. a disruption in the availability, price or quality of these products or materials could adversely affect our operating results.
our business is subject to risks associated with global manufacturing and sourcing. we use a variety of raw materials in the production of our products including steel, aluminum, brass, copper, bronze, zinc, nickel, plastics, phenolics, elastomers and petrochemicals. we also purchase certain electrical and electronic components, including solenoids, lighting ballasts, printed circuit boards, integrated circuit chips and cord sets from a number of suppliers. significant shortages in the availability of these materials or significant price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products, which could adversely impact our results of operations. see also risk factor, "significant developments from the recent and potential changes in u.s. trade policies could have a material adverse effect on us."
we rely on materials, components and finished goods that are sourced from or manufactured in foreign countries including mexico, china, and other international countries. political instability in any country where we do business could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
we rely on our suppliers to produce high quality materials, components and finished goods according to our specifications, including timely delivery. although we have quality control procedures in place, there is a risk that products may not meet our specifications which could adversely affect our ability to ship quality products to our customers on a timely basis and, could adversely affect our results of operations.
we are subject to risks surrounding our information technology systems failures, network disruptions, breaches in data security and compliance with data privacy laws or regulations.
we are highly dependent on various software and information technology systems to record and process operational, human resources and financial transactions. the proper functioning of hubbell's information technology systems is critical to the successful operation of our business. although our information technology systems are protected with robust backup and security systems, these systems are still susceptible to cyber threats, malware, phishing attacks, break-ins and similar events, breaches of physical security or tampering and manipulation of these systems by employees or unauthorized third parties. information security risks also exist with respect to the use of portable electronic devices, such as smartphones and laptops, which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft. hubbell may also be subject to disruptions of any of our systems and our vendor's systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as natural disasters, acts of terrorism, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, and electrical/telecommunications outages or failures. all of these risks are also applicable where hubbell relies on outside vendors to provide services, which may operate in an on-line, or "cloud," environment. a failure of our information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventory, collect accounts receivable and pay expenses; all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information that may result in financial or reputational damage to the company, as well as expose the company to litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.
hubbell also provides customers with solutions that include software components that allow for the control and/or the communication of data from those solutions to hubbell or customer systems. in addition to the risks noted above, there are other risks associated with these solutions. for example, control and/or data from these solutions may be integral to a customer's operations. a failure of our technology to operate as designed or as a result of cyber threats could impact those operations, including by loss or destruction of data. likewise, a customer's failure to properly configure its own network are outside of the company's control and could result in a failure in functionality or security of our technology.
hubbell is also subject to an increasing number of evolving data privacy and security laws and regulations that impose requirements on the company and our technology prior to certain use or transfer, storing, processing, disclosure, and protection of data and prior to sale or use of certain technologies. failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines, penalties and other costs. for example, the european union's implementation of the general data protection regulation in 2018, the european union's pending eprivacy regulation, and california's implementation of its consumer privacy act of 2018 and connected device privacy act of 2018 all could disrupt our ability to sell products and solutions or use and transfer data because such activities may not be in compliance with applicable law in certain jurisdictions.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k we have continued to work on improving our utilization of our enterprise resource planning system, expanding standardization of business processes and performing implementations at our remaining businesses. we expect to incur additional costs related to future implementations, process reengineering efforts as well as enhancements and upgrades to the system. these system modifications and implementations could result in operating inefficiencies which could adversely impact our operating results and/or our ability to perform necessary business transactions.
system failures, ineffective system implementation or disruptions, failure to comply with data privacy and security laws or regulations, it system risk arising from the company's acquisition activity or the compromise of security with respect to internal or external systems or portable electronic devices could damage the company's systems or infrastructure, subject us to liability claims, or regulatory fines, penalties, or intervention, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations, disrupt customer operations, and adversely affect the company's internal control over financial reporting, business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
future tax law changes could increase our prospective tax expense. in addition, tax payments may ultimately differ from amounts currently recorded by the company.
we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. the determination of the company's worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires judgment and is based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in the various jurisdictions where the company operates. although management believes its estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in its financial statements and may adversely affect the company's financial results for the period when such determination is made. we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provisions. however, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the future outcomes of these audits could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
tax legislation may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
on december 22, 2017 public law 115-97 "an act to provide reconciliation pursuant to titles ii and v of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018" was enacted. this law is commonly referred to as the tax cuts and job act of 2017 ("tcja"). the tcja significantly changed the u.s. internal revenue code, including taxation of u.s. corporations, by, among other things, reducing the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate, limiting the availability of previously claimed deductions, taxing certain activities and transactions not previously subject to u.s. tax and imposing a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on certain undistributed earnings and profits of u.s.-owned foreign corporations. throughout 2018 and 2019, the u.s. treasury and the internal revenue service ("irs") issued numerous and complex proposed and final regulations, and related guidance on various aspects of the tcja. however, many of the provisions of tcja remain unclear and subject to interpretation. the legislation also remains subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase certain impacts of the legislation. further, state taxing authorities continue to evaluate the impact of tcja and enact legislation and issue guidance on the state impacts of tcja. see note 13 - income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the legislation remains uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.
in addition, foreign jurisdictions may also enact tax legislation that could alter the manner in which corporations are subject to tax in their jurisdictions that could significantly affect our ongoing operations. aspects of u.s. tax reform could also lead foreign jurisdictions to respond by enacting additional tax legislation that is unfavorable to us.
significant developments from the recent and potential changes in u.s. trade policies could have a material adverse effect on us.
the u.s. government has announced and, in some cases, implemented a new approach to trade policy, including renegotiating, or potentially terminating, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements, such as the north american free trade agreement ("nafta") or its anticipated successor agreement, the u.s.-mexico-canada agreement, which is still subject to formal ratification by the united states and canada, and proposed trade agreements, like the trans-pacific partnership ("tpp"), from which the united states has formally withdrawn, as well as implementing the imposition of additional tariffs on certain foreign goods, including finished products and raw materials such as steel and aluminum. changes in the u.s. trade policy, u.s. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sell products, and any resulting negative sentiments towards the united states as a result of such changes, could have an adverse effect on our business.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k we rely on materials, components and finished goods, such as steel and aluminum, that are sourced from or manufactured in foreign countries, including china and mexico. import tariffs and potential import tariffs have resulted or may result in increased prices for these imported goods and materials and, in some cases, may result or have resulted in price increases for domestically sourced goods and materials. changes in u.s. trade policy have resulted and could result in additional reactions from u.s. trading partners, including adopting responsive trade policies making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products or import goods and materials from those countries. these measures could also result in increased costs for goods imported into the u.s. or may cause us to adjust our worldwide supply chain. either of these could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in lowering our margin on products sold.
various countries, and regions, including, without limitation, china, mexico, canada and europe, have announced plans or intentions to impose or have imposed tariffs on a wide range of u.s. products in retaliation for new u.s. tariffs. these actions could, in turn, result in additional tariffs being adopted by the u.s. these conditions and future actions could have a significant adverse affect on world trade and the world economy. to the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the united states increase the price of, or limit the amount of, raw materials and finished goods imported into the united states, the costs of our raw materials may be adversely affected and the demand from our customers for products and services may be diminished, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
we cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impacts on our business. the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the u.s. economy, which in turn could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.
our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. failure to ensure that we have the depth and breadth of personnel with the necessary skill set and experience, or the loss of key employees, could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategy.
the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of brexit and related negative developments in the european union could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in 2016, the united kingdom voted to leave the european union ("eu") (commonly referred to as "brexit"). as a result of the referendum, a complex and uncertain process of negotiation has taken place which to date has not resulted in a definitive agreement to establish the future terms of the uk's relationship with the eu or other countries. notwithstanding, the uk exited the eu on january 31, 2020 under a transitional arrangement scheduled to remain in place until the end of 2020. the transitional arrangement is intended primarily to maintain the status quo with respect to uk-eu trade and adherence to eu rules while a definitive exit agreement is negotiated. we conduct business in both the uk and eu and shipments from our uk subsidiaries represented 3% of our total net sales in both 2019 and 2018. the long-term nature of the uk's relationship with the eu is unclear and there is considerable uncertainty when, or if, any withdrawal agreement or long-term relationship strategy, including trade deals, will be agreed to and implemented by the uk and the eu. brexit could adversely affect european or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions and regulatory agencies. brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the uk, the eu and elsewhere. there can be no assurance that any or all of these events, or others that we cannot anticipate at this time, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
deterioration in the credit quality of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
we have an extensive customer base of distributors, wholesalers, electric utilities, oems, electrical contractors, telecommunications companies and retail and hardware outlets. we are not dependent on a single customer, however, our top ten customers account for approximately 41% of our net sales. deterioration in the credit quality of several major customers could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
inability to access capital markets or failure to maintain our credit ratings may adversely affect our business.
our ability to invest in our business and make strategic acquisitions may require access to the capital markets. if general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly, it could impact our ability to access capital. failure to maintain our credit ratings could also impact our ability to access credit markets and could increase our cost of borrowing. while we have not encountered significant financing difficulties recently, the capital and credit markets could deteriorate. market conditions could make it more difficult for us to access capital to finance our investments and acquisitions. this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k if the underlying investments of our defined benefit plans do not perform as expected, we may have to make additional contributions to these plans.
we sponsor certain pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans. the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact these plan expenses and funding obligations. significant changes in market interest rates, investment losses on plan assets and reductions in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. furthermore, there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets will be sufficient to meet future funding requirements.
volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our international operations accounted for approximately 9% of our net sales in 2019. we are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on translating the financial statements of our international operations, most of which are denominated in local currencies, into the u.s. dollar. fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our international operations. in addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. as a result, fluctuating exchange rates may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.
our reputation and our ability to conduct business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.
we cannot provide absolute assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. in particular, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees or agents. any such improper actions could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigation in the united states and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigative fees.
we could incur significant and/or unexpected costs in our efforts to successfully avoid, manage, defend and litigate intellectual property matters.
the company relies on certain patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property of which the company cannot be certain that others have not and will not infringe upon. although management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material impact on its operating results, intellectual property litigation could be costly and time consuming and the company could incur significant legal expenses pursuing these claims against others.
from time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement. any dispute or litigation involving intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. in addition, as a result of such claims, the company may lose its rights to utilize critical technology or may be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at a substantial cost, any of which could negatively impact our operating results. even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement, we may incur significant costs that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. see item 3 "legal proceedings" for a discussion of our legal proceedings.
we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.
as of december 31, 2019, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $2.6 billion. as required by generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments both within and outside the company's control. deteriorating economic conditions, technological changes, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, intensified competition, divestitures, market capitalization declines and other factors may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations in the periods an impairment is recognized.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k our business and results of operations may be materially adversely effected by compliance with import and export laws.
we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the import and export of products, services and technology from the u.s. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons. in certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. the length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products or performance of services and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. in addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation. moreover, any changes in export control or sanctions regulations may further restrict the export of our products or services, and the possibility of such changes requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant. any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that may adversely impact our operating results.
we are a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims, including those involving product liability, intellectual property and environmental matters, which could be significant. it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of every claim and lawsuit. in the future, we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. in addition, while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims, such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against such claims. we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us. subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make additional payments, which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
we are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment, and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for clean up or other costs or damages under environmental laws. in addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations, including those imposed in response to climate change concerns. compliance with any future laws and regulations could result in a materially adverse effect on our business and financial results. see item 3 "legal proceedings" for a discussion of our legal proceedings.
regulations related to conflict-free minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and may create challenges with our customers.
the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability regarding the use of "conflict" minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries ("drc"). the sec has established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use "conflict" minerals sourced from the drc in their products. these new requirements could limit the pool of suppliers who can provide conflict-free minerals and as a result, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain these conflict-free minerals at competitive prices. compliance with these new requirements may also increase our costs. in addition, we may face challenges with our customers if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals used in our products.
we face the potential harms of natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations.
natural disasters, the economic uncertainty resulting from the spread of global epidemics, acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, and the actions taken by the united states and other governments in response to such events could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations, our suppliers or our customers, and could create political or economic instability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could decrease demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products, or disrupt our supply chain.
uncertainty about the future of the london interbank offer rate ("libor") may adversely affect our business and financial results.
our 2018 credit facility and term loan agreement use libor as a reference rate, such that the interest due pursuant to such loans may be calculated using libor plus an applicable margin (determined by reference to a ratings based grid) or the alternate base rate. in july 2017, the uk's financial conduct authority, which regulates libor, announced its intent to phase out libor by the end of 2021. it is not possible to predict the effect of this announcement, including whether libor will continue in place, and if so what changes will be made to it, what alternative reference rates may replace libor in use going forward, and how libor will be determined for purposes of loans, securities and derivative instruments currently referencing it if it ceases to exist. if the method for calculation of libor changes, if libor is no longer available or if lenders have increased costs due to changes in libor, we may suffer from potential increases in interest rates on our floating rate debt. further, we may need to renegotiate our 2018 credit facility or term loan agreement to replace libor with the new standard that is established. these uncertainties or their resolution also could negatively impact our funding costs, loan and other asset values, asset-liability management strategies, and other aspects of our business and financial results.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k
item 7    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview of the business the company is primarily engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of quality electrical and electronic products for a broad range of non-residential and residential construction, industrial and utility applications. products are either sourced complete, manufactured or assembled by subsidiaries in the united states, canada, puerto rico, china, mexico, the uk, brazil, australia, spain and ireland. the company also participates in joint ventures in taiwan, hong kong and the philippines, and maintains offices in singapore, italy, china, india, mexico, south korea, chile, and countries in the middle east. the company employed approximately 18,800 individuals worldwide as of december 31, 2019.
the company's reporting segments consist of the electrical segment and the power segment. results for 2019, 2018 and 2017 by segment are included under "segment results" within this management's discussion and analysis.
the company's long-term strategy is to serve its customers with reliable and innovative electrical and related infrastructure solutions with desired brands, high-quality service, delivered through a competitive cost structure; to complement organic revenue growth with acquisitions that enhance its product offerings; and to allocate capital effectively to create shareholder value.
our strategy to complement organic revenue growth with acquisitions focuses on acquiring assets that extend our capabilities, expand our product offerings, and present opportunities to compete in core, adjacent or complementary markets. our acquisition strategy also provides the opportunity to advance our revenue growth objectives during periods of weakness or inconsistency in our end-markets.
our strategy to deliver products through a competitive cost structure has resulted in ongoing restructuring and related activities. our restructuring and related efforts include the consolidation of manufacturing and distribution facilities, and workforce actions, as well as streamlining and consolidating our back-office functions. the primary objectives of our restructuring and related activities are to optimize our manufacturing footprint, cost structure, and effectiveness and efficiency of our workforce.
productivity improvement also continues to be a key area of focus for the company and efforts to drive productivity complement our restructuring and related activities to minimize the impact of rising material costs and other cost inflation. material costs are approximately sixty percent of our cost of goods sold therefore volatility in this area can significantly affect profitability. our goal is to have pricing and productivity programs that offset material and other inflationary cost increases as well as pay for investments in key growth areas.
productivity programs affect virtually all functional areas within the company by reducing or eliminating waste and improving processes. we continue to expand our efforts surrounding global product and component sourcing and supplier cost reduction programs. value engineering efforts, product transfers and the use of lean process improvement techniques are expected to continue to increase manufacturing efficiency. in addition, we continue to build upon the benefits of our enterprise resource planning system across all functions.
acquisition of aclara on february 2, 2018 the company acquired aclara for approximately $1.1 billion. aclara is a leading global provider of smart infrastructure solutions for electric, gas, and water utilities, with advanced metering solutions and grid monitoring sensor technology, as well as leading software enabled installation services. the acquisition extends the power segment's capabilities into smart automation technologies, accelerates ongoing innovation efforts to address utility customer demand for data and integrated solutions, and expands the segment's reach to a broader set of utility customers.
for additional information about the aclara acquisition, refer to note 3 - business acquisitions and dispositions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k results of operations our operations are classified into two reportable segments: electrical and power. for a complete description of the company's segments, see part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. within these segments, hubbell serves customers in five primary end markets: non-residential construction, residential construction, industrial, energy-related markets (also referred to as oil and gas markets) and utility markets (also referred to as the electrical transmission and distribution (t&d) market). in order of magnitude of net sales, the company's served markets are electrical t&d, non-residential construction, industrial, oil and gas, and residential construction.
in 2019 we achieved two percent organic net sales growth on mixed end market trends. our utility facing markets drove strong growth within our power segment, resulting in organic net sales increasing by approximately 5.5% as compared to the prior year. end market performance within the electrical segment was mixed, however, as non-residential and residential markets experienced modest growth, gas distribution markets remained solid, while industrial and oil markets were soft, resulting in a modest decline in organic net sales as compared to the prior year.
operating margins expanded in both the electrical and power segments in 2019, driven by effective cost management and price realization. that expansion included the impact of increased investments in restructuring and related activities in 2019 and the effect of section 301 tariffs on certain of our businesses (the "tariffs" referred to in the following discussion of results of operations). in 2019, net income attributable to hubbell grew by 11 percent compared to the prior year and diluted earnings per share grew by 12 percent. adjusted net income(1) grew by four percent in 2019 compared to the prior year and adjusted diluted earnings per share(1) grew by five percent in 2019, reflecting our strong operating income performance.
free cash flow was strong in 2019 at $497.7 million as compared to $420.9 million in the prior year(2). in 2019 we paid $186.6 million in shareholder dividends, an increase of eight percent as compared to the prior year, while also reducing our long term debt by $225.0 million and allocating approximately $71 million of capital to acquisitions.
(1) adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-gaap financial measures. see "adjusted operating measures" below for a reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measures.
(2) free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure. see "adjusted operating measures" and "financial condition, liquidity and capital resources - cash flow" below for a reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measure.

hubbell incorporated - form 10-k adjusted operating measures in the following discussion of results of operations, we refer to "adjusted" operating measures. we believe those adjusted measures, which exclude the impact of certain costs, gains and losses, may provide investors with useful information regarding our underlying performance from period to period and allow investors to understand our results of operations without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. management uses these adjusted measures when assessing the performance of the business.
effective with results of operations reported in the first quarter of 2019, "adjusted" operating measures exclude amortization of intangible assets associated with all of our business acquisitions, including inventory step-up amortization associated with those acquisitions. for comparability, all prior period "adjusted" operating measures as well as management's discussion and analysis have been updated to reflect this change in definition.
adjusted operating measures in 2019 also exclude a gain on the disposition of the haefely business, an investment loss as well as a 2019 net charge to recognize certain additional liabilities associated with the company's previously disclosed withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan. those items are reported in total other expense (below operating income) in the consolidated statements of income. refer to note 3 - business acquisitions and dispositions, and note 15 - commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
our adjusted operating measures also exclude aclara transaction costs recognized in 2017 and 2018, income tax effects associated with u.s. tax reform recognized in 2017, and the loss on extinguishment of debt incurred in 2017 from the redemption of all of our $300 million outstanding long-term unsecured, unsubordinated notes that were scheduled to mature in 2018. however, the net tax benefit of approximately $6 million related to adjustments made in connection with the company's accounting for the effects of tcja during the measurement period in 2018 has not been reflected as an adjustment to the gaap measures and is therefore not a reconciling item in the adjusted operating measures below.

2019 compared to 2018
net sales net sales of $4.6 billion in 2019 increased by two percent compared to 2018 primarily due to higher organic volume and the contribution of an additional month of net sales in 2019 associated with the aclara acquisition which closed on february 2, 2018. organic net sales growth contributed approximately two percentage points, including favorable price realization, and acquisitions added approximately one percentage point, partially offset by an approximately one percentage point decline in net sales from the disposal of the haefely business and foreign exchange.
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold decreased by 50 basis points to 70.5% of net sales in 2019 as compared to 71.0% in 2018. the improvement was primarily driven by favorable price realization and savings from our productivity initiatives that outpaced cost increases as well as lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, partially offset by higher restructuring and related costs, and lower net sales unit volume.
gross profit the gross profit margin in 2019 increased by 50 basis points to 29.5% of net sales as compared to 29.0% in 2018. excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, the adjusted gross profit margin was 30.0% in 2019 as compared to 29.7% in 2018 and increased primarily due to favorable price realization and savings from our productivity initiatives that outpaced cost increases, partially offset by higher restructuring and related costs, and lower net sales unit volume.
selling & administrative expenses s&a expense in 2019 was $756.1 million and increased by $12.6 million compared to the prior year. s&a expense as a percentage of net sales declined by 10 basis points from 16.6% in 2018 to 16.5% in 2019. excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and aclara transaction costs incurred in 2018, adjusted s&a expense as a percentage of net sales increased by 40 basis points from 15.3% in 2018 to 15.7% in 2019 primarily due to higher restructuring and related costs in 2019 partially offset by volume leverage associated with higher reported net sales dollars.
operating income operating income increased seven percent in 2019 to $596.6 million compared to 2018, and operating margin increased by 60 basis points to 13.0%. excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and aclara transaction costs incurred in 2018, adjusted operating income increased approximately four percent in 2019 to $668.7 million compared to 2018 and adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points to 14.6% in 2019. the increase in adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin is the result of higher gross profit and expanding gross profit margin in 2019, from price realization and productivity in excess of cost increases, partially offset by the effect of lower unit volume, and higher restructuring and related costs.
total other expense total other expense decreased by $13.8 million in 2019 to $76.1 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the impact of certain discrete non-operating items, including a $21.7 million gain recognized on the disposal of the haefely business partially offset by an $8.5 million net charge associated with the withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan and subsequent execution of a settlement agreement with regard to the withdrawal obligation, and a $5.0 million loss on an investment in an available-for-sale debt security. interest expense, net of investment income, reported within total other expense for 2019 declined by $4.4 million as compared to the same period of the prior year.
income taxes the effective tax rate was 21.7% in 2019 as compared to 21.6% in 2018. the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the absence of favorable adjustments related to tcja recorded in 2018, largely offset by the net favorable impact of dispositions, reserve releases related to statute of limitations expiration, and favorable provision to return adjustments recorded in 2019.
net income attributable to hubbell and earnings per diluted share net income attributable to hubbell was $400.9 million in 2019 and increased 11% as compared to 2018. excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, aclara transaction costs, and the impact of non-operating items within other expense, as described above, adjusted net income attributable to hubbell was $445.7 million in 2019 and increased 4% as compared to 2018. earnings per diluted share in 2019 increased 12% compared to 2018. adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2019 increased 5% as compared to 2018 and reflects higher adjusted net income as well as a decline in the average number of diluted shares outstanding of 0.2 million as compared to the prior year.

net sales of the electrical segment in 2019 were $2.6 billion and decreased 130 basis points as compared to 2018 due to an approximately forty basis point decline in organic net sales growth, as the effect of lower unit volume was slightly greater than sales growth from favorable price realization, a fifty basis point decline in net sales due to the disposal of the haefely business and a forty basis point decline from foreign exchange.
22   hubbell incorporated - form 10-k within the electrical segment, the aggregate net sales of our commercial and industrial and construction and energy business groups were flat in 2019, as net sales growth from favorable price realization offset the effect of lower unit volume, the disposal of the haefely business, and foreign exchange. organic net sales growth of our products serving the natural gas distribution market was solid in 2019, while oil related markets were weak, industrial markets were soft and non-residential markets were mixed. net sales of our lighting business group decreased by approximately four percent in 2019 as the effect of lower unit volume outpaced favorable price realization. within the lighting business group, net sales of residential lighting products increased by approximately one percentage point and net sales of commercial and industrial lighting products declined by approximately five percentage points compared to 2018.
operating income of the electrical segment in 2019 was $320.1 million and was slightly lower compared to 2018. operating margin in 2019 increased by 10 basis points to 12.2%. excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, adjusted operating margin also increased by 10 basis points to 13.1% primarily due to favorable price realization and productivity that were greater than cost increases (including tariffs), partially offset by the impact of lower unit volume and higher restructuring and related costs. the operating margin decreased slightly in 2019 as compared to the prior year due to the disposal of the haefely business.

net sales in the power segment in 2019 were $2.0 billion, an increase of approximately 8% as compared to 2018, due to 5.5% of organic growth and approximately 3% of growth from acquisitions, partially offset by approximately 0.5% from foreign currency translation. organic net sales growth was primarily driven by the transmission and distribution (t&d) market.
operating income in the power segment increased by 17% to $276.5 million in 2019 and operating margin in 2019 increased by 110 basis points to 14.1%. excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and aclara transaction costs, the adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points to 16.6% primarily driven by favorable price realization and productivity which outpaced cost increases (including tariffs), and a benefit from higher net sales volume, partially offset by one additional month of operating results of the aclara business in 2019 and higher restructuring and related costs.
2018 compared to 2017
net sales net sales of $4.5 billion in 2018 increased 22.2% percent compared to 2017 due to the contribution of net sales from acquisitions, higher organic volume and favorable price realization. acquisitions added 17.8% to net sales, primarily from the acquisition of aclara, while organic volume, including favorable price realization, contributed 4.4%. the effect of foreign exchange was flat compared to the prior year.
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold increased by 250 basis points to 71.0% of net sales in 2018 as compared to 68.5% in 2017. the increase was primarily driven by acquisitions, as 2018 includes $29.5 million of aclara acquisition-related costs as well as the effect of adding the operating results of aclara, which carries a relatively higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales (and lower gross margin) as compared to the legacy hubbell business. the increase also reflects an unfavorable net impact of price and material costs, as rising material costs and the impact of tariffs outpaced favorable price realization.
gross profit gross profit margin in 2018 compared to 2017 declined by 250 basis points to 29.0% of net sales, driven by costs of goods sold discussed above. excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, the adjusted gross profit margin was 29.7% in 2018 as compared to 31.5% in 2017.
selling & administrative expenses s&a expense in 2018 was $743.5 million and increased by $107.2 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the addition of s&a costs of aclara, including $20.8 million of aclara acquisition-related and transaction costs. s&a expense as a percentage of net sales declined by 70 basis points to 16.6% in 2018. excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and aclara transaction costs, adjusted s&a expense as a percentage of net sales declined by 200 basis points to 15.3% in 2018 primarily due to volume leverage associated with higher net sales.
operating income operating income increased seven percent in 2018 to $556.9 million, primarily driven by the operating results of the aclara business, including acquisition-related and transaction costs. the increase in operating income from higher net sales volume was largely offset by rising material costs and the impact of tariffs, which together, outpaced favorable price realization.
operating margin decreased by 170 basis points to 12.4% due to higher amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and aclara transaction costs in 2018 as well as the operating results of the aclara business, which carries a relatively lower gross margin as compared to the legacy hubbell results. the decrease in operating margin also reflects the impact of material costs, tariffs and price realization noted above, which together were only partially offset by the benefit from higher net sales volume.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and aclara transaction costs, adjusted operating income increased 14.6% percent in 2018 to $642.3 million and adjusted operating margin declined by 100 basis points to 14.3% in 2018.
total other expense total other expense in 2018 was $89.9 million and increased by $14.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense from the issuance of $450 million of 2028 notes and placement of the $500 million term loan, each in the first quarter of 2018, to finance the aclara acquisition, partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt recognized in 2017 (which did not repeat in 2018).
income taxes the effective tax rate was 21.6% in 2018 as compared to 43.6% in 2017. the decrease is primarily attributable to the absence of the $56.5 million provisional income tax expense associated with the tcja recognized in the 2017 financial statements, the reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and net favorable adjustments to the 2017 provisional income tax expense associated with tcja recognized in 2018 of approximately $6 million.
additional information related to the company's effective tax rate is included in note 13 - income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements net income attributable to hubbell and earnings per diluted share net income attributable to hubbell was $360.2 million in 2018 and increased 48% as compared to 2017. the increase reflects a lower effective tax rate, higher operating income and the loss on extinguishment of debt in 2017 (which did not repeat in 2018), offset partially by higher interest expense. adjusted net income attributable to hubbell was $428.0 million in 2018 and increased 28% as compared to 2017. earnings per diluted share in 2018 increased 49% compared to 2017. adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2018 increased 29% as compared to 2017.

net sales in the electrical segment were $2.7 billion, up five percent in 2018 as compared with 2017 due to approximately five percentage points of net sales growth from higher organic volume, including favorable price realization for the segment. acquisitions increased net sales by less than one percentage point and the effect of foreign currency translation was flat.
within the segment, the aggregate net sales of our commercial and industrial and construction and energy business groups increased by seven percentage points, due to approximately six percentage points of organic growth, and approximately one percentage point of net sales growth from acquisitions. organic net sales growth of these businesses was driven primarily by our products serving the energy-related markets as well as the non-residential and residential construction markets. net sales of our lighting business group increased approximately two percent in 2018 due to higher organic volume, partially offset by pricing headwinds. within the lighting business group, net sales of residential lighting products increased by 12%, driven by strong unit volume growth, while net sales of commercial and industrial lighting products declined by 2% as a result of lower volume and pricing headwinds.
operating income in the electrical segment for 2018 was $320.8 million and increased nine percent compared to 2017. operating margin in 2018 increased by 50 basis points to 12.1%. the increase in operating margin is primarily due to incremental earnings on higher net sales, as discussed above, and productivity gains in excess of cost increases, partially offset by material cost headwinds (including the impact of tariffs) that outpaced price realization. excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, adjusted operating margin increased by 40 basis points to 13.0%.

net sales in the power segment were $1.8 billion, up approximately 60% as compared to 2017, primarily due to the addition of net sales of the aclara business as well as higher organic volume. acquisitions contributed 56.6% to net sales growth and higher organic volume contributed 4.1%, including favorable price realization. organic net sales growth was driven by the transmission and distribution (t&d) and telecommunications markets. foreign exchange reduced net sales as compared to the prior year by less than one percentage point.
operating income in the power segment for 2018 increased by five percent to $236.1 million as compared to the prior year. operating margin in 2018 decreased to 13.0% as compared to 19.8% in 2017 and reflects an approximately 2% decline from higher amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and aclara transaction costs in 2018, as well as approximately 2% attributable to the lower margin operating results of the aclara business. the decrease in operating margin also reflects a net headwind from material cost increases (including the impact of tariffs) that outpaced price realization, and the absence of a one-time benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017. excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, adjusted operating margin in 2018 decreased to 16.3% as compared to 21.3% in 2017.

free cash flow is a non-gaap measure that we define as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. management believes that free cash flow provides useful information regarding hubbell's ability to generate cash without reliance on external financing. in addition, management uses free cash flow to evaluate the resources available for investments in the business, strategic acquisitions and further strengthening the balance sheet.

2019 compared to 2018
cash provided by operating activities for 2019 increased compared to 2018 primarily due to improvements within working capital. cash provided by working capital was $22.2 million in 2019 as compared to cash used for working capital of $25.6 million in 2018, primarily due to lower accounts receivable and inventories, partially offset by lower accounts payable and other current liabilities.
cash used for investing activities of $128.9 million in 2019 decreased compared to cash used of $1,201.4 million in 2018. this decrease is primarily due to approximately $70.8 million paid for acquisitions in 2019 compared to $1.1 billion paid for the acquisition of aclara in 2018. additionally, 2019 included $33.4 million of proceeds from the disposal of a business, as compared to none in 2018, and an $8.0 million decrease in the proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities in 2019.
cash used from financing activities was $471.0 million in 2019 compared to $506.5 million of cash provided in 2018. the change in cash flows from financing activities reflects the proceeds of the $450 million public debt offering in february 2018 and $500 million term loan issued in february 2018 to fund the acquisition of aclara, compared to zero additional long term debt in 2019. long-term debt repayments in 2019 were $56.2 million higher than in 2018 due to a $200 million discretionary payment in december 2019, partially offset by lower short term debt repayments of $37.2 million compared to 2018. dividend payments to shareholders increased $14.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018.
the favorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash was $1.3 million in 2019 as compared to an unfavorable effect of $8.2 million in 2018. the favorable effect in 2019 was primarily related to the u.s. dollar weakening against the canadian dollar and mexican peso.
2018 compared to 2017
cash provided by operating activities for 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to a higher contribution from net income and the related non-cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization, partially offset by $26.2 million of additional pension funding in 2018 compared to 2017. cash used for working capital was $25.6 million in 2018 compared to $29.0 million in 2017 primarily due to improved inventory management in 2018, partially offset by higher accounts receivables and aclara related items, including cash payments for transaction costs in 2018.
cash used for investing activities of $1,201.4 million in 2018 increased compared to cash used of $245.6 million in 2017. this increase was primarily due to approximately $1.1 billion paid for the acquisition of aclara in 2018, $16.5 million of higher capital expenditures and an $11.6 million decrease in the proceeds from disposition of assets in 2018, as compared to 2017.
cash provided from financing activities of $506.5 million in 2018 increased compared to $214.3 million of cash used in 2017. the change in cash flows from financing activities reflects the proceeds of the $450 million public debt offering in february 2018 and $500 million term loan issued in february 2018 to fund the acquisition of aclara, as well as, lower share repurchases in 2018, partially offset by cash used to reduce short-term borrowings.
the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash was $8.2 million in 2018 as compared to a favorable effect of $18.3 million in 2017. the unfavorable effect in 2018 was primarily related to the u.s. dollar strengthening against the canadian dollar, australian dollar and british pound.
investments in the business investments in our business include cash outlays for the acquisition of businesses as well as expenditures to maintain the operation of our equipment and facilities and invest in restructuring activities.
in the fourth quarter of 2019, the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of cantega technologies inc., including its wholly owned subsidiary greenjacket inc., and all of the issued and outstanding shares of reliaguard inc. (collectively "cantega") for $36.3 million, net of cash acquired, and the company also acquired substantially all of the assets of connector products, incorporated ("cpi") for $28.0 million.
in february 2018, the company completed the acquisition of aclara for approximately $1.1 billion in an all-cash transaction. to fund the aclara acquisition, on february 2, 2018 the company borrowed $500 million under a term loan agreement with a syndicate of lenders, issued $450 million of unsecured, 3.50% senior notes maturing in 2028, and the remaining purchase price and transaction expenses were funded with commercial paper. refer to note 3 - business acquisitions and note 12 - debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
we continue to invest in restructuring and related programs to maintain a competitive cost structure, drive operational efficiency and mitigate the impact of rising material costs and administrative cost inflation. we expect our investment in restructuring and related activities in 2020 to continue as we continue to invest in previously initiated actions and initiate further footprint consolidation and other cost reduction initiatives.
in connection with our restructuring and related actions, we have incurred restructuring costs as defined by u.s. gaap, which are primarily severance and employee benefits, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation, as well as facility closure, contract termination and certain pension costs that are directly related to restructuring actions. we also incurred restructuring-related costs, which are costs associated with our business transformation initiatives, including the consolidation of back-office functions and streamlining our processes, and certain other costs and gains associated with restructuring actions. we refer to these costs on a combined basis as "restructuring and related costs", which is a non-gaap measure. we believe this non-gaap measure provides investors with useful information regarding our underlying performance from period to period.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k restructuring costs are predominantly settled in cash from our operating activities and are generally settled within one year, with the exception of asset impairments, which are non-cash.

stock repurchase program on october 20, 2017, the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program (the "october 2017 program") that authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of common stock and expires on october 20, 2020. the company repurchased $35.0 million and $40.0 million of shares of common stock, in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and the remaining share repurchase authorization under the october 2017 program is $325.0 million as of december 31, 2019. subject to numerous factors, including market conditions and alternative uses of cash, we may conduct discretionary repurchases through open market or privately negotiated transactions, which may include repurchases under plans complying with rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended.
debt to capital at december 31, 2019 and 2018, the company had $1,506.0 million and $1,737.1 million, respectively, of long-term debt outstanding, net of unamortized discount and the unamortized balance of capitalized debt issuance costs. at december 31, 2019 and 2018 the company also had $34.4 million and $25.0 million, respectively of long-term debt classified as short-term on the consolidated balance sheets, reflecting maturities due within the next 12 months.
principal amounts of long-term debt at december 31, 2019 consisted of unsecured, senior notes in principal amounts of $300 million due in 2022, $400 million due in 2026, $300 million due in 2027, and $450 million due in 2028 (collectively, the "notes") as well as $106.3 million remaining principal amount of borrowing under a term loan agreement.
the 2028 notes were issued in february 2018 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.50%. net proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 notes were $442.6 million after deducting the discount on the notes and offering expenses paid by the company.
the 2027 notes were issued in august 2017 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.15%. net proceeds from the issuance were $294.6 million after deducting the discount on the notes and offering expenses paid by the company. in september 2017, the company applied the net proceeds from the 2027 notes to redeem all of its $300 million of long-term, unsecured, unsubordinated notes maturing in 2018 and bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.95%. in connection with this redemption, the company recognized a loss on the early extinguishment of the 2018 notes of $6.3 million on an after-tax basis.
the notes are callable at any time at specified prices and are only subject to accelerated payment prior to maturity upon customary events of default under the indentures governing such notes, or upon a change in control triggering event as defined in such indentures. the company was in compliance with all covenants (none of which are financial) as of december 31, 2019.
on january 31, 2018, the company entered into a term loan agreement (the "term loan agreement") with a syndicate of lenders under which the company borrowed $500 million on an unsecured basis to partially finance the aclara acquisition on february 2, 2018.
pursuant to the contractual loan amortization schedule, $34.4 million and $25 million of borrowings under the term loan agreement are classified as short-term within current liabilities on the december 31, 2019 and 2018 consolidated balance sheets.
at december 31, 2019 and 2018, the company had $65.4 million and $56.1 million, respectively, of short-term debt outstanding composed of;
◦   $26.0 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at december 31, 2019 and 2018.
◦   $34.4 million at december 31, 2019 and $25.0 million at december 31, 2018, respectively, of long-term debt classified as short-term within current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, reflecting maturities within the next twelve months relating to our borrowing under the term loan agreement.
◦   $5.0 million at december 31, 2019 and $5.1 million at december 31, 2018, respectively, of borrowings to support our international operations in china.
net debt, defined as total debt less cash and investments, is a non-gaap measure that may not be comparable to definitions used by other companies. we consider net debt to be a useful measure of our financial leverage for evaluating the company's ability to meet its funding needs.

liquidity we measure liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short-term and long-term operational funding needs, fund additional investments, including acquisitions, and make dividend payments to shareholders. significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, cash dividend payments, stock repurchases, access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms.
in 2019, we invested in acquisitions and also returned capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. these activities were funded primarily with cash flows from operations and proceeds from the disposal of the haefely business.
◦   cash used for the acquisition of businesses in 2019, net of cash acquired was $70.8 million, including cash settlement of a deferred purchase price obligation related to a previous acquisition. further discussion of our acquisitions can be found in note 3 - business acquisitions and dispositions in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
◦   in 2019, cash used for share repurchases was $35.0 million. dividends paid on our common stock in 2019 were $186.6 million.
we also require cash outlays to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements to accommodate anticipated levels of business activity, as well as our rate of cash dividends and potential future acquisitions. we have contractual obligations for long-term debt, operating leases, purchase obligations, and certain other long-term liabilities that are summarized in the table of contractual obligations as of december 31, 2019. as a result of the tcja, we also have an obligation to fund, over the next six years, the company's liability for the transition tax on the 2017 deemed repatriation of foreign earnings.
our sources of funds and available resources to meet these funding needs are as follows:
◦   cash flows from operations and existing cash resources: we held $182.0 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2019, of which approximately 12% was held inside the united states and the remainder held internationally. the company repatriated a portion of its foreign earnings in 2019. the consolidated financial statements reflect the income tax effects of the repatriation of these earnings as well as the income tax effects of certain anticipated future cash repatriations.
◦   on january 31, 2018, the company entered into the term loan agreement and a five-year revolving credit agreement (the "2018 credit facility") with a syndicate of lenders that provides a $750 million committed revolving credit facility and terminated all commitments under the company's previous credit facility. commitments under the 2018 credit facility may be increased (subject to certain conditions) to an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.250 billion. the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the 2018 credit facility is generally either the adjusted libor plus an applicable margin (determined by a ratings based grid) or the alternate base rate. the single financial covenant in the 2018 credit facility requires that total debt not exceed 65% of total capitalization as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the company. the 2018 credit facility expires in february 2023. as of december 31, 2019 the company had not drawn against the 2018 credit facility.
annual commitment fees to support availability under the 2018 credit facility are not material. although not the principal source of liquidity, we believe our 2018 credit facility is capable of providing significant financing flexibility at reasonable rates of interest. however, an increase in usage of the 2018 credit facility related to growth or a significant deterioration in the results of our operations or cash flows, could cause our borrowing costs to increase and/or our ability to borrow could be restricted. we have not entered into any guarantees that could give rise to material unexpected cash requirements.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k
◦   the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the term loan agreement is generally either adjusted libor plus an applicable margin (determined by a ratings based grid) or the alternate base rate. the sole financial covenant in the term loan agreement requires that total debt not exceed 65% of total capitalization as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the company.
the principal amount of borrowings under the term loan agreement amortize in equal quarterly installments of 5% per year in year one, 5% per year in year two, 7.5% per year in year three, 10% per year in year four, 10% per year in year five, and any remaining borrowings under the term loan agreement are due and payable in full in february 2023. the company may also make principal payments in excess of the amortization schedule at its discretion and, during 2018 and 2019, the company made $150 million and $200 million, respectively, of such principal payments.
◦   in addition to our commercial paper program and existing revolving credit facility, we also have the ability to obtain additional financing through the issuance of long-term debt. considering our current credit rating, historical earnings performance, and financial position we believe that we would be able to obtain additional long-term debt financing on attractive terms.
◦   the company also maintains other lines of credit that are primarily used to support the issuance of letters of credit. interest rates and other terms of borrowing under these lines of credit vary from country to country, depending on local market conditions. at december 31, 2019 and 2018, total availability under these lines was $23.0 million and $54.8 million, respectively, of which $15.7 million and $20.3 million was utilized to support letters of credit and the remaining amount was unused. the annual commitment fees associated with these lines of credit are not material.
pension funding status we have a number of funded and unfunded non-contributory u.s. and foreign defined benefit pension plans. benefits under these plans are generally provided based on either years of service and final average pay or a specified dollar amount per year of service. the funded status of our qualified, defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including future returns on invested pension assets, the level of market interest rates, employee earnings and employee demographics.
in 2019, the company approved amendments to one of its domestic qualified defined benefit pension plans, which froze service accruals for nearly all active participants within the plan effective january 1, 2020. as a result of the amendment, the company recognized a $0.3 million curtailment charge, net of tax.
in 2018, the company approved amendments to one of its foreign defined benefit pension plans, which closed the plan to future service accruals effective august 31, 2018. as a result of the amendments, in the third quarter of 2018, the company recognized a curtailment gain of approximately $4.7 million, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income. in addition, effective august 31, 2018, the amortization of actuarial gains and losses is being recognized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants of this plan, as all participants are considered inactive as a result of the amendment.
in 2018, we completed transactions with a third-party insurer to settle approximately $28 million of projected benefit obligations of our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plans.
changes in the value of the defined benefit plan assets and liabilities will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. although differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results are no longer deferred for balance sheet purposes, deferral is still permitted for pension expense purposes. unrecognized gains and losses in excess of an annual calculated minimum amount (the greater of 10% of the projected benefit obligation or 10% of the market value of assets) have been amortized and recognized in net periodic pension cost. effective january 1, 2020, the amortization of unrecognized gains and losses of all of the company's qualified defined benefit pension plans is recognized over the remaining life expectancy of participants, as all participants are considered inactive as a result of plan amendments. during 2019 and 2018, we recorded $9.6 million and $10.5 million, respectively, of pension expense related to the amortization of these unrecognized losses.
in 2019, 2018 and 2017, we contributed $10.4 million, $27.9 million, and $1.7 million, respectively, to our qualified foreign and domestic defined benefit pension plans. these contributions have improved the funded status of those plans. although not required by erisa and the internal revenue code, the company may elect to make a voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic defined benefit pension plan in 2020. the company expects to contribute approximately $4.3 million to its foreign plans in 2020. the anticipated level of pension funding in 2020 is not expected to have a significant impact on our overall liquidity.

at the end of each year, we estimate the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets based on the strategic asset allocation for our plans. in making this determination, we utilize expected rates of return for each asset class based upon current market conditions and expected risk premiums for each asset class. a one percentage point change in the expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets would have an impact of approximately $7.4 million on 2020 pretax pension expense. the expected long-term rate of return is applied to the fair market value of pension fund assets to produce the expected return on fund assets that is included in pension expense.
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets was recognized at december 31, 2019 for balance sheet purposes, but continues to be deferred for expense purposes. the net deferral of past asset gains (losses) ultimately affects future pension expense through the amortization of gains (losses) with an offsetting adjustment to hubbell shareholders' equity through accumulated other comprehensive loss.
at the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of our pension plan liabilities. for our u.s. and canadian pension plans, this discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows associated with our benefit obligations to the expected cash flows of a hypothetical portfolio of high quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that closely match the expected funding period of our pension liabilities. as of december 31, 2019, we used a discount rate of 3.30% for our u.s. pension plans compared to a discount rate of 4.40% used in 2018. for our canadian pension plan, we used a discount rate of 3.00% in 2019, compared to the 3.60% discount rate used in 2018.
for our uk pension plan the discount rate was derived using a full yield curve and uses plan specific cash flows. the derived discount rate is the single discount rate equivalent to discounting these liability cash flows at the term-dependent spot rates of aa corporate bonds. this methodology resulted in a december 31, 2019 discount rate for the uk pension plan of 2.10% as compared to a discount rate of 2.90% used in 2018.
a decrease of one percentage point in the discount rate would lower our 2020 pretax pension expense by approximately $0.1 million. a discount rate increase of one percentage point would increase our 2020 pretax pension expense by an immaterial amount.
in 2019 we changed the mortality table used to calculate the present value of our pension plan liabilities from the rp-2014 mortality table, with generational projection from 2006 using scale mp-2018 to the pri-2012 mortality table, with generational projection from 2012 using scale mp-2019. that change did not have a material impact to the projected benefit obligation of our u.s. plans upon remeasurement at december 31, 2019. the pri-2012 mortality table, with generational projection from 2012 using scale mp-2019 was chosen as the best estimate based on the observed and anticipated experience of the plans after considering alternative tables.
other post employment benefits ("opeb")
the company also has a number of health care and life insurance benefit plans covering eligible employees who reached retirement age while working for the company. these benefits have been discontinued for substantially all future retirees. these plans are not funded and, therefore, no assumed rate of return on assets is required. we use a similar methodology to derive the yield curve for our post employment benefit plan obligations that we use for our pension plans. as of december 31, 2019, the company used a discount rate of 3.30% to determine the projected benefit obligation compared to a discount rate of 4.40% used in 2018.
in accordance with the accounting guidance for retirement benefits, we recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss, within hubbell shareholders' equity, a benefit, net of tax, of approximately $0.9 million in 2019 and a charge, net of tax, of approximately $0.3 million in 2018, related to the annual remeasurement of the opeb plans and the amortization of prior service credits and net actuarial gains.

(c)   amount above includes future payments associated with the one-time transition tax under the tcja.
our purchase obligations include amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price, quantity, delivery and termination liability. these obligations primarily consist of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements and commitments for equipment purchases. as of december 31, 2019, we have $41.9 million of uncertain tax positions reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate regarding the timing of settlement of these uncertain tax positions and, as a result, they have been excluded from the table. see note 13 - income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k critical accounting estimates note 1 - significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements.
use of estimates we are required to make assumptions and estimates and apply judgments in the preparation of our financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. we base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors deemed relevant by management. we continually review these estimates and their underlying assumptions to ensure they are appropriate for the circumstances. changes in estimates and assumptions used by us could have a material impact on our financial results. we believe that the following estimates are among the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. these items utilize assumptions and estimates about the effect of future events that are inherently uncertain and are based on our judgment.
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when performance obligations identified under the terms of contracts with its customers are satisfied, which generally occurs, for products, upon the transfer of control in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the sale. the majority of the company's revenue associated with products is recognized at a point in time when the product is shipped to the customer, with a relatively small amount of transactions in the power segment recognized upon delivery of the product at the contractually specified destination. revenue from service contracts and post-shipment performance obligations is approximately three percent of total annual consolidated net revenue and those service contracts and post-shipment obligations are primarily within the power segment. revenue from service contracts and post-shipment performance obligations is recognized when or as those obligations are satisfied. the company primarily offers assurance-type standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations and on occasion will separately offer and price extended warranties that are separate performance obligations for which the associated revenue is recognized over-time based on the extended warranty period. the company records amounts billed to customers for reimbursement of shipping and handling costs within revenue. shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of goods sold. sales taxes and other usage-based taxes are excluded from revenue.
the company has certain arrangements that require us to estimate at the time of sale the amounts of variable consideration that should not be recorded as revenue as certain amounts are not expected to be collected from customers, as well as an estimate of the value of the product to be returned. the company principally relies on historical experience, specific customer agreements and anticipated future trends to estimate these amounts at the time of shipment and to reduce the transaction price. these arrangements include sales discounts and allowances based on sales volumes, specific programs and special pricing allowances, and returned goods, as are customary in the electrical products industry. customer returns have historically ranged from 1%-2% of gross sales.
inventory valuation inventories in the u.s. are primarily valued at the lower of lifo cost or market, while non-u.s. inventories are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market. we routinely evaluate the carrying value of our inventories to ensure they are carried at the lower of lifo or fifo cost or market value. such evaluation is based on our judgment and use of estimates, including sales forecasts, gross margins for particular product groupings, planned dispositions of product lines, technological events and overall industry trends. in addition, the evaluation is based on changes in inventory management practices which may influence the timing of exiting products and method of disposing of excess inventory.
excess inventory is generally identified by comparing future expected inventory usage to actual on-hand quantities. inventory values are reduced for on-hand inventory in excess of pre-defined usage forecasts. forecast usage is primarily determined by projecting historical (actual) sales and inventory usage levels forward to future periods. changes in these estimates may necessitate future adjustments to inventory values.
customer credit and collections we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable in order to reflect the potential uncollectability of receivables related to purchases of products on open credit. if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make required payments, we may be required to record additional allowances for doubtful accounts.
accrued insurance we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers' compensation, medical, automobile and general liability insurance. we estimate self-insurance liabilities using a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. the accrued liabilities associated with these programs are based on our estimates of ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. these assumptions are periodically reviewed with a third-party actuary to determine the adequacy of these self-insurance reserves. changes in these assumptions may necessitate future adjustments to these self-insurance liabilities.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k employee benefits costs and funding we sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension, defined contribution and other postretirement plans. significant assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on the pension fund assets, rate of increase in employee compensation levels and health care cost increase projections. these assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement dates. further discussion of the assumptions used in 2019 and 2018 are included above under "pension funding status" and in note 11 - retirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. additionally, deferred tax assets are required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets are the forecast of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets, and future reversals of deferred tax liabilities. failure to achieve forecasted taxable income can affect the ultimate realization of net deferred tax assets.
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. the internal revenue service ("irs") and other tax authorities routinely review our tax returns. these audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. the company records uncertain tax positions when it has determined that it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the company uses the criteria established in the accounting guidance to determine whether an item meets the definition of more-likely-than-not. the company's policy is to recognize these uncertain tax positions when the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, when the statute of limitations has expired or upon settlement. in management's opinion, adequate provision has been made for potential adjustments arising from any examinations. see note 13 - income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
contingent liabilities we are subject to proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims or uncertainties related to environmental, legal, product and other matters. we routinely assess the likelihood of an adverse judgment or outcome to these matters, as well as the range of potential losses. we record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. a determination of the reserves required, if any, is made after careful analysis, including consultations with outside advisors, where applicable. where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments.
warranty the company offers product warranties that cover defects on most of its products. these warranties primarily apply to products that are properly installed, maintained and used for their intended purpose. the company accrues estimated warranty costs at the time of sale. estimated warranty expenses, recorded in cost of goods sold, are based upon historical information such as past experience, product failure rates, or the estimated number of units to be repaired or replaced. adjustments are made to the product warranty accrual as claims are incurred, additional information becomes known or as historical experience indicates.
valuation of long-lived assets our long-lived assets include land, buildings, equipment, molds and dies, software, goodwill and other intangible assets. long-lived assets, other than land, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. goodwill represents purchase price in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. intangible assets primarily consist of patents, tradenames, developed technology and customer related intangibles.
we review depreciable long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. if such a change in circumstances occurs, the related estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition is compared to the carrying amount. if the sum of the expected cash flows of the asset group is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded. the impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. the fair value of impaired assets is determined using expected cash flow estimates, quoted market prices when available and appraisals as appropriate. we did not record any material impairment charges related to long-lived assets in 2019, 2018, or 2017.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment unless circumstances dictate the need for more frequent assessment. we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of april 1st of each year unless circumstances dictate the need for more frequent assessments. the accounting guidance provides entities an option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing a quantitative analysis. if the entity determines, on the basis of certain qualitative factors, that it is more-likely-than-not that the goodwill is not impaired, the entity would not need to proceed to the quantitative goodwill impairment testing process as prescribed in the guidance. the company performed a qualitative assessment for four of its seven reporting units. the company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative analysis for its remaining reporting units.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future discounted cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. we use internal discounted cash flow estimates to determine fair value. these cash flow estimates are derived from historical experience and future long-term business plans and include assumptions of future sales growth, gross margin, operating margin, terminal growth rate, and the application of an appropriate discount rate. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. as of april 1, 2019, our goodwill testing resulted in fair values for each reporting unit that substantially exceeded the reporting unit's carrying value. we have not recorded any goodwill impairments since the initial adoption of the accounting guidance in 2002.
the identification and measurement of impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. if it is more-likely-than-not that the asset is impaired, the fair value of the indefinite lived intangibles will be determined using discounted cash flow estimates. if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the estimated fair value, the carrying value will be reduced to the estimated fair value. we did not record any impairments related to indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2019, 2018, or 2017.
stock-based compensation we determine the grant date fair value of certain stock-based compensation awards using either a lattice model or the black-scholes option pricing model. both of these models require management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. these inputs include assumptions for the expected term, stock volatility, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. changes in these inputs impact fair value and could impact our stock-based compensation expense in the future. in addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those awards expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions. if our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, adjustments to stock-based compensation expense may be required. see also note 17 - stock-based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

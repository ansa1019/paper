item 1a.risk factors our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. the matters described below are not the only risks and uncertainties facing our company, and risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below also may impair our business operations. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows can be negatively affected, the value of securities we have issued could be adversely affected, resulting in stockholders and purchasers losing part or all of their investment, and we may not be able to achieve our strategic initiatives or expectations. this annual report also includes statements reflecting assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are intended as "forward-looking statements" under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and should be read in conjunction with the section entitled uncertainty of forward-looking statements and information included in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
risks related to our industries and operating our business our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
our business can be highly cyclical and is subject to seasonality and other factors that can result in significantly different operating results from quarter to quarter, and therefore our results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of future results. our quarterly results have been and may in the future be materially and/or adversely affected by, among other things:
•   the timing and volume of work we perform and our performance with respect to ongoing projects;
•   project delays, reductions in project scope, project terminations or cancellations and increases in project costs, including as a result of, among other things, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions or events, legal challenges or permitting, regulatory or environmental processes;
•   variations in the size, scope, costs and margins of ongoing projects and the mix of our customers, contracts and business;
•   fluctuations in economic, political and market conditions on a regional, national or global basis;
•   pricing pressures as a result of competition;
•   changes in the budgetary spending patterns or strategic plans of customers or federal, state, provincial and local governments;
•   liabilities and costs incurred in our operations that are not covered by, or that are in excess of, our third-party insurance, including significant liabilities that arise from the inherently hazardous conditions of our operations (e.g., explosions, fires) and which could be exacerbated by the geographies in which we operate;
•   disputes with customers or delays relating to billing and payment under our contracts and change orders;
•   payment risk associated with the financial condition of customers, including customers affected by the volatility of natural gas and oil prices or that have filed for bankruptcy protection;
•   the resolution of, or unexpected or increased costs associated with, pending or threatened legal proceedings, indemnity obligations, multiemployer pension plan obligations (e.g., withdrawal liability) or other claims asserted against us;
•   the termination or expiration of existing customer agreements;
•   restructuring, severance and other costs associated with winding down certain operations and exiting markets, including our latin american operations;
•   estimates and assumptions in determining our financial results, remaining performance obligations and backlog, including the timing and significance of impairments of long-lived assets, equity or other investments, receivables, goodwill or other intangible assets;
•   significant fluctuations in foreign currency rates;
•   the recognition of tax impacts related to changes in tax laws or uncertain tax positions; and
•   the timing and magnitude of costs we incur to support growth internally or through acquisitions or otherwise.
negative economic and market conditions, including low oil and natural gas production volumes and prices, can adversely impact our customers' future spending as well as payment for our services.
stagnant or declining economic conditions, including a prolonged economic downturn or recession, as well as significant events that have an impact on financial or capital markets, can adversely impact the demand for our services and result in the delay, reduction or cancellation of certain projects. a number of factors can adversely affect the industries we serve, including, among other things, financing conditions, potential bankruptcies and global and u.s. trade relationships and other geopolitical events. a reduction in cash flow or the lack of availability of debt or equity financing for our customers could result in a reduction in our customers' spending for our services and also impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. consolidation, competition, capital constraints or negative economic conditions in the electric power, energy or communications industries can also result in reduced spending by, or the loss of, one or more of our customers.
our pipeline and industrial infrastructure services segment is exposed to risks associated with the oil and gas industry. these risks, which are not subject to our control, include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices and production, the development of and consumer demand for alternative energy sources, and legislative and regulatory actions, as well as public opinion, regarding the impact of fossil fuels on the climate and environment. specifically, lower prices and production volumes, or perceived risk thereof, can result in decreased or delayed spending by our customers, including with respect to larger pipeline and industrial projects. in addition, the 2020 u.s. presidential and congressional elections may result in a change in administration and control of congress with the potential consequence of increased restrictions on oil and gas production activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the oil and gas industry. if the profitability of our pipeline and industrial infrastructure services segment were to decline, our overall financial position, results of operations and cash flows could also be adversely affected. additionally, a decline in prices, production or the development of resource plays can negatively impact certain portions of our electric power infrastructure services segment. for example, the low price of oil has had an adverse impact on the canadian economy, which has impacted demand for some of our electric power services in canada.
a variety of issues outside of our control could affect the timing of and our performance on projects, which may result in additional costs to us, reductions or delays in revenues, the payment of liquidated damages or project termination.
our business is dependent in part upon projects that can be cyclical in nature and are subject to risks of delay or cancellation. the timing of or failure to obtain contracts, delays in awards of, start dates for or completion of projects and the cancellations of projects can result in significant periodic fluctuations in our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. many of our projects involve challenging engineering, permitting, procurement and construction phases that occur over extended time periods, sometimes several years, and we have encountered and may in the future encounter project delays or project performance issues as a result of, among other things:
•   delays in the delivery or management of design or engineering information, equipment or materials;
•   schedule changes;
•   natural disasters, including wildfires, earthquakes and significant weather events (e.g., hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, floods, droughts, blizzards and extreme temperatures);
•   adverse weather conditions (e.g., prolonged rainfall or snowfall, early thaw in canada and the northern united states, other unseasonable weather patterns);
•   our or a customer's failure to timely obtain permits or rights of way or meet other permitting, regulatory or environmental requirements or conditions;
•   difficult terrain and site conditions where delivery of materials and availability of labor are impacted or where there is exposure to harsh and hazardous conditions;
•   protests, legal challenges or other political activity or opposition to a project;
•   changes in permitting and regulatory requirements during the course of our work; and
•   other factors such as terrorism, military action and public health crises (including the outbreak of the recent coronavirus);
•   additional complexity, timing uncertainty or extended bidding, regulatory and permitting processes associated with the projects where we provide engineering, procurement and construction (epc) services.
in addition, we contract with third-party suppliers and subcontractors to assist us with the completion of contracts, and approximately 15% to 20% of our work is subcontracted to other service providers. a delay or failure to perform by suppliers or by subcontractors can result in delays in the overall progress of the project or cause us to incur additional costs.
many of these difficulties and delays are beyond our control and can negatively impact our ability to complete the project in accordance with the required delivery schedule or achieve our anticipated margin on the project. delays and additional costs may be substantial and not recoverable from third parties, and in some cases, we may be required to compensate the customer for such delays. furthermore, in certain circumstances we guarantee project completion or performance by a scheduled date, and failure to meet the schedule or performance requirements can result in additional costs or penalties, including liquidated damages. such amounts could exceed expected project profit. in extreme cases, project delay or performance difficulties can result in project cancellation by a customer or damage to our reputation or relationship with a customer, which can adversely affect our ability to secure new contracts. additional costs or penalties, a reduction in our productivity or efficiency or a project termination in any given period can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. for example, as discussed in further detail in legal proceedings within note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, the termination of a telecommunications project in peru resulted in a $79.2 million charge to earnings in the second quarter of 2019.
our revenues and profitability can be exposed to potential risk if our customers encounter financial difficulties or file bankruptcy or disputes arise with our customers.
our contracts often require us to satisfy or achieve certain milestones in order to receive payment, or in the case of cost-reimbursable contracts, provide support for billings in advance of payment. as a result, we can incur significant costs or perform significant amounts of work prior to receipt of payment. we face difficulties collecting payment and sometimes failed to receive payment for such costs in circumstances where our customers do not proceed to project completion, terminate or cancel a contract, default on their payment obligations, or dispute the adequacy of our billing support. we have in the past brought, and may in the future bring, claims against our customers related to the payment terms of our contracts. for example, we have filed an international arbitration proceeding against the customer in connection with the terminated telecommunications project in peru, which seeks to recover, among other things, amounts related to a net receivable position of approximately $120 million as of december 31, 2019. for additional information on this matter, see legal proceedings within note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims can have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and any such claims may harm our relationships with our customers.
slowing economic conditions in the industries we serve can also impair the financial condition of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. further, to the extent a customer files bankruptcy, payment of amounts owed can be delayed and certain payments we receive prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition may be avoided and returned to the customer's bankruptcy estate. for example, in january 2019, pg&e corporation and pacific gas and electric company (collectively, pg&e), one of our largest customers, filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the u.s. bankruptcy code, as amended, which impacted the collection of approximately $165 million of pre-petition receivables. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - concentrations of credit risk for additional information on this matter. additionally, many of our customers for larger projects are project-specific entities that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project and could be more likely to encounter financial difficulties relating to their businesses. we ultimately may be unable to collect amounts owed to us by customers experiencing financial difficulties or in bankruptcy, and accounts receivable from such customers may become uncollectible and ultimately have to be written off, which could have an adverse effect on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our business is subject to operational hazards, including, among others, wildfires and explosions, that can result in significant liabilities and that may be exacerbated by certain geographies and locations where we perform services, and we may not be insured against all potential liabilities.
due to the nature of services we provide and the conditions in which we and our customers operate, our business is subject to operational hazards and accidents that can result in significant liabilities. these operational hazards include, among other things, electricity, fires, explosions, leaks, collisions, mechanical failures, and damage from severe weather conditions and natural disasters. furthermore, certain of our customers operate energy- and communications-related infrastructure assets in locations and environments that increase the likelihood and/or severity of these operational hazards, including as a result of changes in climate and other factors in recent years. in particular, we perform a significant amount of services, including operational, consulting and other services, for customers that operate electrical power, natural gas and communications infrastructure assets in the western united states, australia and other locations that have recently experienced, and have a higher risk of, wildfires. for example, certain of quanta's operating units perform inspection, consulting, repair, maintenance and other services for utilities and other customers that operate electric power and other infrastructure in california and other areas in the western united states, including recent inspection of, and other services relating to, the electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure operated by pg&e in california. pg&e and certain other utility customers have been determined to be or are potentially responsible for catastrophic wildfires that have occurred in recent years. quanta's operating units have received document hold requests and subpoenas in connection with these events. we are not a party to any pending legal proceeding relating to such wildfires at this time, and no related claims asserting liabilities against quanta or its operating units have been filed. however, there is no assurance that claims will not be filed in the future.
we also often perform services in locations that are densely populated and that have higher value property and assets, such as california and metropolitan areas, which can increase the impact of any of these hazards or other accidents we experience. we recently acquired the hallen construction co., inc. (hallen), a company that specializes in underground gas and electric distribution and transmission services and operates in metropolitan areas throughout the northeastern united states, including new york city, new york. this acquisition, including certain assumed liabilities associated with its pre-acquisition operations, which are described further in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, increases our potential exposure to certain of these hazards and accidents.
events arising from operational hazards and accidents have resulted in significant liabilities to us in the past and may expose us to significant claims and liabilities in the future. these claims and liabilities can arise through indemnification obligations to customers, our negligence or otherwise, and because our services in certain instances are integral to the operation and performance of our customers' infrastructure, such claims and liabilities can arise even if our operations are not the cause of the harm. our exposure to liability can also extend for a number of years after we complete our services, and potential claims and liabilities arising from significant accidents and events can take a number of years and significant legal costs to ultimately resolve.
potential liabilities include, among other things, claims associated with personal injury, including severe injury or loss of life, and significant damage to property, equipment and the environment, and other claims discussed above and can lead to suspension of operations, adverse effects to our safety record and reputation and/or material legal costs and liabilities. in addition, if any of these events or losses related thereto are found to be the result of our or our customer's activities or services, we could be subject to government enforcement actions or regulatory penalties, litigation and/or civil or governmental actions, including investigations, citations and fines. insurance coverage may not be available to us or may be insufficient to cover the cost of any of these liabilities and legal costs. if we are not fully insured or indemnified against such liabilities and legal costs or a counterparty fails to meet its indemnification obligations to us, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. further, to the extent our reputation or safety record is adversely affected, demand for our services could decline or we may not be able to bid for certain work.
unavailability or cancellation of third-party insurance coverage would increase our overall risk exposure, as well as disrupt our operations, and estimates of losses covered by our insurance policies could prove incorrect.
we maintain insurance coverage from third-party insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits. we are insured for, among other things, employer's liability, workers' compensation, auto liability and general liability claims, but such insurance is subject to deductibles and limits and may be canceled or may not cover all of our losses. we manage and maintain a portion of our casualty risk through our wholly-owned captive insurance company, which insures all claims up to the amount of the applicable deductible of our third-party insurance programs. in connection with our casualty insurance programs, we are required to issue letters of credit to secure our obligations. our insurance policies include various coverage requirements, including the requirement to give appropriate notice, and coverage could be denied if we fail to comply with those requirements.
additionally, our insurance coverages may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all claims and liabilities asserted against us, and if we are not fully insured against such claims and liabilities, it could expose us to significant liabilities and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we also renew our insurance policies on an annual basis, and therefore deductibles and levels of coverage offered by third parties may change in future periods. for example, due to the increased occurrence in recent years and future risk of wildfires in california and other areas in the western united states, australia and other locations, insurers have reduced coverage limits and increased the cost of insurance coverage for those events. as a result, we expect our level of insurance coverage for wildfire events will decrease at the time of our annual insurance renewal in the spring of 2020, and such level may not be sufficient to cover potential losses. in addition, our third party insurers could decide to further reduce or exclude coverage for wildfires in the future. there can also be no assurance that any of our other existing third-party insurance coverages will be renewed at their current levels or at all or that any future coverage will be available at reasonable and competitive rates. our third-party insurers could also fail, cancel our coverage or otherwise be unable or unwilling to provide us with adequate insurance coverage. adverse changes in our insurance coverage could increase our exposure to uninsured losses, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or result in a disruption of our operations.
losses under our insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimate of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. these insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. if we experience claims or costs above our estimates, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
our business is labor-intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees or we may incur significant costs in the event we are unable to efficiently manage our workforce.
our ability to efficiently manage our business and achieve our strategic initiatives is limited by our ability to employ, train and retain the necessary skilled personnel, which is subject to a number of risks. the commencement of new, large-scale infrastructure projects or increased demand for infrastructure improvements, as well as the aging electric utility workforce, has reduced and may further reduce the pool of skilled workers, including qualified journeyman lineman, available for our electric power infrastructure services segment. with respect to our pipeline and industrial infrastructure services segment, there is limited availability of experienced supervisors and foremen that can oversee larger diameter pipeline projects. the cyclical nature of the natural gas and oil industry can also create shortages of qualified labor during periods of high demand and production. a shortage in the supply of these personnel creates competitive hiring markets that may result in increased labor expenses. additionally, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant education and training expenses in order to recruit and train employees.
the uncertainty of contract award timing and project delays can also present difficulties in managing our workforce size. our inability to efficiently manage our workforce may require us to incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancies that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the loss of, or reduction in business from, one or a few customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.
a few customers have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenues. for example, our ten largest customers accounted for 34% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019. although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant customers, a significant customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue business with us at any time or merge or be acquired by a company that decides to reduce or discontinue business with us. pg&e, one of our largest customers, has filed for bankruptcy, and other significant customers may file for bankruptcy protection or cease operations, which could also result in reduced or discontinued business with us. the loss of business from a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we may fail to adequately recover on contract change orders or claims brought by us against customers.
we have in the past brought, and may in the future bring, claims against our customers. these types of claims occur due to, among other things, delays caused by customers and third parties and changes in project scope, which can result in additional costs that may not be recovered until the claim is resolved. while we generally negotiate with the customer for additional compensation, we may be unable to obtain, through negotiation, arbitration, litigation or otherwise, adequate amounts to compensate us for the additional work or expenses incurred. litigation or arbitration with respect to these matters is generally lengthy and costly, involves significant uncertainty as to timing and amount of any resolution, and can adversely affect our relationship with existing or potential customers. furthermore, we can be required to invest significant working capital to fund cost overruns while the resolution of a claim is pending. failure to obtain adequate and prompt compensation for these matters can result in a reduction of revenues and gross profit recognized in prior periods or the recognition of a loss. any such reduction or loss can be substantial and can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our failure to accurately estimate project costs or successfully execute a project could result in reduced profits or losses.
we currently generate, and expect to continue generating, a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts, including contracts for projects where we provide epc services (e.g., large electric transmission and pipeline projects, facility and terminal projects). under these contracts, we assume risks related to project estimates and execution, and project revenues, profitability and costs can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original projections due to a variety of factors, including:
•   unforeseen circumstances or project modifications not included in our cost estimates or covered by our contract for which we cannot obtain adequate compensation, including concealed or unknown environmental, geological or geographical site conditions and technical problems such as design or engineering issues;
•   failure to accurately estimate project costs or accurately establish the scope of our services;
•   failure to coordinate performance of subcontractors, suppliers and other third parties or delays and failure to perform by such parties;
•   inability to meet project schedule requirements or achieve guaranteed performance or quality standards for a project, which can result in increased costs or the payment of liquidated damages to the customer;
•   failure to properly make judgments in accordance with applicable professional standards (e.g., engineering standards);
•   changes in the cost of equipment, commodities, materials or labor;
•   contract termination or suspension and our inability to obtain reimbursement for services performed, costs incurred or expected profit;
•   delays or productivity issues caused by adverse weather conditions, significant weather events or other natural disasters;
•   delays and additional costs associated with obtaining required permits or approvals;
•   changes in laws or regulations;
•   delays and additional costs attributable to legal challenges and protests and other political activity; and
•   quality issues, including those requiring rework or replacement.
these factors and events can result in reputational harm or cause actual revenues and gross profits for a project to differ from what we originally estimated, resulting in reduced profitability or losses on projects. such differences can materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
changes in estimates related to revenues and costs associated with our contracts with customers could result in a reduction or elimination of revenues, a reduction of profits or the recognition of losses.
for fixed price contracts and certain unit-price contracts, we recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied over time and earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability, as discussed in further detail in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. changes in contract estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions to the estimates are made, and contract losses are recognized in full when losses are determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. variable consideration amounts, including performance incentives, early pay discounts and penalties, may also cause changes in contract estimates. in addition, we recognize amounts associated with change orders and/or claims as revenue when it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted and the amount of any such adjustment can be reasonably estimated, which can result in the recognition of costs prior to the recognition of the related revenue. furthermore, actual amounts collected in connection with change orders can differ from estimated amounts.
consequently, the timing for recognition of revenues and profit or loss and any subsequent changes in estimates is uncertain and could result in a reduction or an elimination of previously reported revenues or profits or the recognition of losses on the associated contract. any such adjustments could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
during the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings.
we have in the past been, and may in the future be, named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. these actions seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury (including claims for loss of life), workers' compensation, employment discrimination, sexual harassment, workplace misconduct, wage and hour claims and other employment-related damages, compensation for breach of contract, negligence or gross negligence or property damage, environmental liabilities, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, punitive damages, consequential damages, and civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief. in addition, we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide and actions we take under our contracts, and, in some instances, we are allocated risk through our contract terms for actions by our customers, subcontractors or other third parties. because our services in certain instances can be integral to the operation and performance of our customers' infrastructure, we have been and may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any failure of the systems that we work on, even if our services are not the cause of such failures. we could also be subject to civil and criminal liabilities, which could be material. insurance coverage may not be available or may be insufficient for these lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings. the outcome of any allegations, lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings, as well as any public reaction thereto, is inherently uncertain and could result in significant costs, damage to our brands or reputation and diversion of management's attention from our business. payments of significant amounts, even if reserved, could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. for details on our existing litigation, claims and other legal proceedings, refer to note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
we may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth, which could adversely affect our business.
many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth are beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies for achieving internal growth will be successful. inability to successfully generate internal growth may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to:
•   expand the range of services we offer to customers to address their evolving infrastructure needs;
•   attract new customers;
•   increase the number of projects performed for existing customers;
•   hire and retain qualified employees;
•   expand geographically; and
•   address regulatory, environmental and permitting requirements and economic or market conditions that affect us or our customers.
many of our contracts may be canceled or suspended on short notice or may not be renewed upon completion or expiration, and we may be unsuccessful in replacing our contracts, which could adversely affect our business.
our customers have in the past and may in the future cancel, delay or reduce the number or size of projects available to us for a variety of reasons, including capital constraints or inability to meet regulatory requirements. furthermore, many of our customers may cancel or suspend our contracts on short notice, typically 30 to 90 days, even if we are not in default under the contract. certain of our customers assign work to us on a project-by-project basis under master service agreements. under these agreements, our customers generally have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us. our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows can be negatively impacted if any of the following occur:
•   our customers cancel or suspend contracts having significant value;
•   we fail to renew a significant number of our existing contracts;
•   we complete a significant number of non-recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects;
•   the anticipated volume of work under an existing master service agreement is not assigned to us;
•   we are not the successful bidder on our existing contracts that are subject to re-bid in the future; or
•   we fail to reduce operating and overhead expenses consistent with any decrease in our revenues.
our business is highly competitive, and competitive pressures, technological advancements and other market conditions could negatively affect our business.
the specialty contracting business is served by numerous companies, from small, owner-operated private companies to large multi-national, public companies. relatively few barriers prevent entry into some areas of our business, and as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become one of our competitors. in addition, some of our competitors have significant financial, technical and marketing resources. our competitors may have or may develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services. similarly, we cannot be certain that we will maintain or enhance our competitive position within the specialty contracting business or maintain our current customer base. certain of our competitors may have lower overhead cost structures, and therefore may be able to provide services at lower rates than us. we also face competition from the in-house service organizations of our existing or prospective customers, which are capable of performing, or acquiring businesses that perform, some of the same types of services we provide. these customers may also face pressure or be compelled by regulatory or other requirements to self-perform an increasing amount of the services we currently perform for them. therefore, we cannot be certain that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource these services in the future.
furthermore, a substantial portion of our revenues is directly or indirectly dependent upon obtaining new contracts. the timing of project awards is unpredictable and often involves complex and lengthy negotiations and bidding processes. these processes are impacted by a wide variety of factors, including price, governmental approvals, financing contingencies, commodity prices, environmental conditions and overall market and economic conditions. the competitive environment we operate in can also affect the timing of contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts. for example, based on rapidly changing competition dynamics, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, more competitive pricing in certain markets, such as the smaller scale transmission and distribution electric power market. our bids also may not be successful due to, among other things, a potential customer's perception of our ability to perform the work or the technological advantages held by our competitors. additionally, changing competitive pressures present difficulties in matching workforce size with available contract awards. as a result, the competitive environment we operate in can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and cause our results of operations and cash flows to fluctuate significantly.
technological advancements and other factors may alter our customers' existing operating model or the services they require, which may also result in reduced demand for our services. in addition, market changes within our customers' industries could impact their future demand for our services, such as a reduction in demand for hydrocarbons or plastics that negatively impacts certain of our customers. our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these changes to our customers' existing operating model in a cost-effective manner and to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards. if we fail to adapt successfully to any change or obsolescence or incur significant expenditures in adapting to such change, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
the nature of our business exposes us to potential liability for warranty, engineering and other related claims.
under our contracts with customers, we typically provide warranties for our services and materials we provide, guaranteeing the work performed against, among other things, defects in workmanship, and may agree to indemnify our customers for losses related to our services. the length of the warranty periods we agree to vary and can extend for several years, and certain projects can have longer warranty periods and include facility performance warranties that are broader than the warranties we generally provide. warranties generally require us to re-perform the services and/or repair or replace the warranted item and any other facilities impacted thereby, at our sole expense, and we could also be responsible for other damages if we are not able to adequately satisfy our warranty obligations. in addition, we can be required under contractual arrangements with our customers to warrant any defects or failures in materials we provide. while we generally require the materials suppliers to provide us warranties that are consistent with those we provide to our customers, if any of these suppliers default on their warranty obligations to us, we may incur costs to repair or replace the defective materials. costs incurred as a result of warranty claims could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
furthermore, our business involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of electric power transmission, communications and pipeline infrastructure. because our projects are often technically complex, our failure to make judgments and recommendations in accordance with applicable professional standards, including engineering standards, could result in damages. a significantly adverse or catastrophic event at a project site or completed project resulting from the services we performed could result in significant professional or product liability, personal injury (including claims for loss of life) or property damage claims or other claims against us, as well as reputational harm. these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or impact our ability to obtain third-party insurance in the future, and customers, subcontractors or suppliers who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us. as a result, these claims could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we can incur liabilities or suffer negative financial or reputational impacts relating to occupational health and safety matters.
our operations are inherently hazardous and subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace. while we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial resources in our occupational health and safety programs, our industry involves a high degree of operational risk, and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability exposure. although we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions, we have suffered serious accidents, including fatalities, and we anticipate that our operations may result in additional serious accidents in the future. as a result of these events, we could be subject to substantial penalties, criminal prosecution or civil litigation, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life, that could result in substantial costs and liabilities. in addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time or we were to suffer substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations, our customers could cancel our contracts and elect to procure future services from other providers. unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the costs of projects for our clients, and raise our operating costs. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
disruptions to our information technology systems or our failure to adequately protect critical data, sensitive information and technology systems could materially affect our business or result in harm to our reputation.
we rely on information technology systems to manage our operations and other business processes and to protect sensitive company information. we also collect and retain information about our customers, stockholders, vendors and employees, all of which expect that we will adequately protect such information. breaches or disruptions of our information systems can result from, among other things, cyber-attacks, theft, inadvertent exposure of sensitive information, acts of terrorism, storms or other natural phenomena, information technology solution failures or network disruptions, and any such cyber-attacks or breaches can go unnoticed for some period of time. an intrusion into the information systems of a business we acquire may also ultimately compromise our systems. furthermore, some of the energy infrastructure systems on which we work may be considered to be strategic targets, and therefore at greater risk of cyber-attacks or acts of terrorism than other targets. cyber-attacks can result in compromises of our payment systems, monetary losses, inability to access our systems, delays in processing transactions or reporting financial results, the disclosure or misappropriation of confidential or proprietary company information (including for the purpose of transacting in our stock), or the release of customer, stockholder, vendor or employee data. an attack could also cause service disruptions to our internal systems or, in extreme circumstances, infiltration into, damage to or loss of control of our customers' energy infrastructure systems. any such breach or disruption could subject us to significant liabilities, cause damage to our reputation or customer relationships, or result in regulatory investigations or other actions by governmental authorities.
we also continue to implement information technology solutions that require substantial financial and personnel resources. there is no guarantee that we will realize economic or other intended benefits from these systems. furthermore, failure to properly implement these systems could result in substantial disruptions to our business, including with respect to coordinating and processing our normal business activities and financial reporting and testing and recording certain data necessary to provide oversight of our disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal controls over our financial reporting, as well as other unforeseen problems.
any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands, which can be exacerbated by the effect of social media or significant media coverage, could have an adverse impact on our business or reputation.
our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets. the success of our business and our ability to attract and retain customers depends on brand recognition and reputation. such dependence makes our business susceptible to reputational damage and to competition from other companies. a variety of events could result in damage to our reputation or brands, some of which are outside of our control, including:
•   acts or omissions that adversely affect our business such as a crime, scandal, cyber-related incident, litigation or other negative publicity;
•   failure to successfully perform a high-profile project;
•   actual or potential involvement in a catastrophic fire, explosion or similar event; or
•   actual or perceived responsibility for a serious accident or injury.
intensifying media coverage, including the considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years, has increased the volume and speed at which negative publicity arising from these events can be generated and spread, and we may be unable to timely respond to, correct any inaccuracies in, or adequately address negative perceptions arising from such media coverage. if the reputation or perceived quality of our brands decline, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected and we could lose the confidence of our customers, which could adversely affect demand for our services.
our financial results are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results.
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap, several estimates and assumptions are used by management to report the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are necessary because certain information used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data or cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. in some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. for example, we utilize estimates in our assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of assets, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill, other intangibles and long-lived asset impairments, equity and other investments, loan receivables, purchase price allocations, acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities, liabilities for insurance and other claims and guarantees, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, revenue recognition for construction contracts inclusive of contractual change orders and claims, share-based compensation, operating results of reportable segments, provision (benefit) for income taxes and the calculation of uncertain tax positions. actual results for all estimates can differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
additionally, our remaining performance obligations and backlog are difficult to determine with certainty. customers often have no obligation under our contracts to assign or release work to us, and many contracts may be terminated on short notice. cancellation or reduction in scope of a contract can significantly reduce the revenues and profit we receive. consequently, our estimates of remaining performance obligations and backlog may not be accurate, and we may not be able to realize our estimated remaining performance obligations and backlog.
our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected as a result of asset impairments.
our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by impairments to goodwill, other intangible assets, receivables, long-lived assets or investments. for example, when we acquire a business, we record goodwill in an amount equal to the amount we paid for the business minus the fair value of the net tangible assets and other intangible assets of the acquired business. goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives cannot be amortized, but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment, as described in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. we have recorded impairments in the past, and any future impairments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the impairment is recognized. for example, during the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018, we recorded $13.9 million and $49.4 million of asset impairment charges primarily related to the winding down and exit of certain oil-influenced operations and assets. additionally, we have concluded to pursue an orderly exit of our latin american operations, which could result in asset impairments related to those operations during 2020 or in subsequent years.
in addition, we enter into various types of investment arrangements in the normal course of business, each having unique terms and conditions. equity investments are reviewed for impairment by assessing whether there has been a decline in the fair value of the investment below the carrying amount and whether that decline is considered to be other than temporary as described in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
our inability to successfully execute our acquisition strategy may have an adverse impact on our growth strategy.
our business strategy includes expanding our presence in the industries we serve through strategic acquisitions of companies that complement or enhance our business. the number of acquisition targets that meet our criteria may be limited. we may also face competition for acquisition opportunities, and other potential acquirers may offer more favorable terms or have greater financial resources available for potential acquisitions. this competition may further limit our acquisition opportunities or raise the prices of acquisitions and make them less accretive, or possibly not accretive, to us. failure to consummate future acquisitions could negatively affect our growth strategies. additionally, our past acquisitions have involved, and our future acquisitions may involve, significant cash expenditures, the incurrence or assumption of debt and the assumption of burdensome regulatory requirements and liabilities. for example, in the hallen acquisition, we assumed certain contingent liabilities associated with hallen's pre-acquisition operations, which are described further in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. as a result, past or future acquisitions may ultimately have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the success of our acquisition strategy also depends on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with our existing operations and realize the anticipated benefits from the acquired businesses, such as the expansion of our existing operations, elimination of redundant costs and capitalizing on cross-selling opportunities. our ability to integrate and realize benefits can be negatively impacted by, among other things:
•   failure of an acquired business to achieve the results we expect;
•   diversion of our management's attention from operational and other matters or other potential disruptions to our existing business;
•   difficulties incorporating the operations and personnel, or inability to retain key personnel, of an acquired business;
•   additional financial reporting and accounting challenges associated with an acquired business;
•   unanticipated events or liabilities associated with the operations of an acquired business;
•   loss of business due to customer overlap or other factors; and
•   risks and liabilities arising from the prior operations of an acquired business, such as performance, operational, safety, workforce or other compliance or tax issues, some of which we may not have discovered or accurately estimated during our due diligence and may not be covered by indemnification obligations or available insurance.
we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully complete the integration process without substantial costs, delays, disruptions or other operational or financial problems. failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our business growth could outpace the capability of our decentralized management structure.
we cannot be certain that our management structure will be adequate to support our operations as they expand. for example, the ability to internally communicate, coordinate and execute business strategies, plans and tactics may be negatively impacted by our increasing size and complexity. a decentralized structure places significant control and decision-making powers in the hands of our operating unit management. this contributes to the risk that we may be slower or less able to identify or react to problems affecting key business matters than we would in a more centralized environment. the lack of timely access to information may also impact the quality of decision making by management. our decentralized organization can also result in our operating subsidiaries assuming excessive risk without appropriate guidance from our centralized legal, accounting, safety, tax, treasury and insurance functions. future growth could also impose significant additional responsibilities on members of our senior management, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to recruit, integrate and retain new senior level managers and executives. to the extent that we are unable to manage our growth effectively or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified management, we may not be able to expand our operations or execute our business plan.
the loss of key personnel could disrupt our business.
we depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management, including the management at each of our operating units. although we typically enter into employment agreements with our executive officers and other key employees for initial terms of one to three years and subsequent renewal options, we cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. the loss of key management personnel, as well as our inability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees that can succeed key personnel, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.
our investments expose us to risks and may result in conflicts of interest that could adversely impact our business or result in reputational harm.
we have entered into strategic relationships and investment arrangements with various partners, including customers and infrastructure investors, through which we have invested and intend to invest in infrastructure assets. we expect this activity to continue in the future and for additional information on our recent investment activity, see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - recent acquisitions, investments and divestitures.
these types of investments expose us to increased risks, including poor performance by the infrastructure projects in which we have invested due to, among other things, difficult market or economic conditions or slowdowns (which may occur across one or more industries, sectors or geographies) or changes to the supply or demand and fluctuations in the price of commodities. that negative performance could result in lower investment returns, a decline in value or total loss of our investments or the possible sale of our investments at values below our initial projections, including at a loss, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. additionally, poor performance of our investments or poor or incomplete performance by our capital partnership structure formed with select infrastructure investors could result in reputational harm to quanta that impairs our ability to participate in future investment opportunities, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to secure certain future projects. for example, in october 2019, due to certain management changes, our capital partnership investment structure with select investors entered into a 180-day period during which the investors and quanta will evaluate the partnership, at the end of which the investors or quanta may elect to end the investment period for any future investments or dissolve the partnership. further, our relationship with a customer or investor that partners with us in a poorly performing investment could become impaired, which may negatively impact our ability to continue providing services to that customer.
conflicts of interest may also exist or arise for us in relation to our investment partners as a result of the structure of our investment arrangements. for example, in these structures, quanta can be the contractor for a project as well as an equity investor and possibly the manager of investments in that project. in those instances, conflicts of interest can exist for such things as contractor pricing and the handling of contractor change orders and other claims. while we have taken certain actions that we believe minimize or address these and other anticipated conflicts of interest, including through internal management practices and the terms of our agreements with investment partners, our failure to properly manage such conflicts of interest can expose us to liability or harm our relationships with investment partners, which could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or cause reputational harm to quanta.
our participation in joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners.
we have entered into joint venture arrangements and likely will continue to do so. the purpose of these joint ventures is typically to combine skills and resources to allow for the bidding and performance of particular projects. success on these projects can be adversely affected by the performance of our joint venture partners, over whom we may have little or no control. differences in opinions or views between us and our joint venture partners may result in delayed decision-making or failure to agree on material issues that may adversely affect the business and operations of our joint ventures. additionally, the failure by a joint venture partner to successfully perform or comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business.
we and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of a joint venture.
if a joint venture partner fails to perform or is unable to satisfy required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from claims or lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for their shortfall. further, if our partners experience cost overruns or project performance issues that we are unable to adequately address, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm our reputation and reduce our profit or increase our loss on a project.
we extend credit to customers for purchases of our services and enter into other arrangements with certain of our customers, which subjects us to potential credit or investment risk.
we grant credit, generally without collateral, to our customers, which include utilities, energy companies, communications providers, governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners and managers of renewable energy facilities and commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the united states, canada, australia and latin america. in certain circumstances, we also allow our customers to defer payment until certain project milestones have been met or until a project is substantially completed, and customers typically withhold some portion of amounts due to us as retainage until a project is complete. in addition, we have provided in the past and may provide in the future other forms of financing to our customers or make investments in our customers' projects. these payment arrangements subject us to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors affecting our customers, and certain of our customers have experienced financial difficulties (including bankruptcy) in recent years, which has impacted our ability to collect amounts owed to us. if we are unable to collect such amounts, or retain amounts paid to us, our cash flows would be reduced, and we could experience losses if those amounts exceed current allowances. business and economic factors resulting in financial difficulties (including bankruptcy) for our customers can also reduce the value of any financing or equity investment arrangements we have with our customers. the risk of loss may increase for projects where we provide services and make a financing or equity investment. losses experienced as a result of these credit and investment risks could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
risks associated with operating in international markets and u.s. territories could restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business and prospects.
our overall business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows can be negatively impacted by our activities and operations outside the continental united states, including our international operations and operations in u.s. territories. although these operations are presently conducted primarily in canada, australia and latin america, we also perform work in other foreign countries and u.s. territories and the number of locations we perform work in could increase in the future. changes in economic conditions, including those resulting from wars and other conflicts, civil unrest, public health crises, such as the recent coronavirus, acts of terrorism, or volatility in global markets, may adversely affect demand for our services and our customers' ability to pay for our services. in addition, at times we are paid for work outside the united states in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. such payments may exceed our local currency needs, and, in certain instances, those amounts may be subject to temporary blocking, taxes or tariffs, and we may experience difficulties if we attempt to convert such amounts to u.s. dollars.
there are numerous other risks associated with operating in international markets, including, but not limited to, changes in applicable regulatory requirements; foreign currency exchange fluctuations; political, economic and social instability; expropriation or nationalization of our assets and operations; unfamiliar foreign legal systems and business practices; and complex u.s. and foreign tax regulations and other laws and international treaties. for example, as discussed in further detail in legal proceedings within note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, the termination of a telecommunications project in peru resulted in a $79.2 million charge to earnings in the second quarter of 2019. furthermore, we may incur significant costs associated with an unsuccessful attempt to enter a new market, or we may enter a new market that ultimately proves to be unprofitable or has an otherwise adverse effect on our business. we may also incur significant costs or liabilities associated with winding down or exiting an existing market. for example, we have determined to pursue an orderly exit of our latin american operations, which could result in significant costs or asset impairments during 2020 or in subsequent years.
additionally, uncertain or changing economic and political conditions may make it difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. for example, recent changes in u.s. policies related to global trade and tariffs, as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the global economy. increases in the cost of certain materials, including steel and aluminum, resulting from these and other trade policies may also impact customer spending. we cannot predict the outcome of these or other similar events, nor can we predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic recovery or downturn worldwide or within our customers' specific markets. these risks could restrict our ability to provide services to international customers, operate our international business profitably or fund our strategic objectives, which could negatively impact our overall business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial results.
the volume of services we provide internationally varies from year to year and our reported financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are exposed to the effects of fluctuating exchange rates. for the year ended december 31, 2019, we derived $1.92 billion, or 15.9%, of our consolidated revenues from foreign operations, the substantial majority of which was earned in canada and australia. the functional currencies for our foreign operations are typically the currency of the country in which the foreign operating unit is located. accordingly, our financial performance is subject to fluctuation due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar. as the u.s. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, our translation of foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses will result in lower u.s. dollar denominated revenues and expenses. conversely, if the u.s. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses will result in increased u.s. dollar denominated revenues and expenses. for example, during the year ended december 31, 2019, foreign revenues decreased by approximately $57 million in comparison with the year ended december 31, 2018 as a result of less favorable foreign currency exchange rates due primarily to the u.s. dollar strengthening against the canadian and australian dollars. furthermore, to the extent the volume of services we provide internationally increases, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be further exposed to the effects of fluctuating exchange rates.
limitations on the availability of suppliers, subcontractors and equipment manufacturers that we depend on could adversely affect our business.
we rely on suppliers to obtain the necessary materials and subcontractors to perform portions of our services. we also rely on equipment manufacturers to provide us with the equipment required to conduct our operations. limitations on the availability of suppliers, subcontractors or equipment manufacturers could negatively impact our operations, particularly in the event we rely on a single or small number of providers. the risk of a lack of available suppliers, subcontractors or equipment manufacturers can be heightened as a result of market, regulatory or economic conditions. for example, utilities in certain states, in order to receive certain funding, may expect us to engage a specified percentage of suppliers that meet diversity-ownership requirements, which can further limit our pool of available suppliers in those areas. additionally, successful completion of our contracts can depend on whether our subcontractors successfully fulfill their contractual obligations. if our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, fail to meet the expected completion dates or quality standards or fail to comply with applicable laws, we may be required to incur additional costs or provide additional services to mitigate such shortcomings.
an increase in the prices of certain materials used in our business or fuel prices could adversely affect our business.
under certain contracts, including where we have assumed responsibility for procuring materials for a project, we are exposed to price increases for materials such as copper and steel, which are used as components of supplies or materials utilized in all of our operations. in addition, our customers' capital budgets can be negatively impacted by an increase in prices of certain materials. prices could be materially impacted by general market conditions and other factors, including global trade relationships. for example, recent changes to u.s. policies related to global trade and tariffs, as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries, have resulted in uncertainty concerning availability and pricing of certain commodities and goods important to our and our customers' businesses, including steel and aluminum. we are also exposed to increases in energy prices, including as they relate to fuel prices for our large rolling-stock fleet of approximately 49,700 units. furthermore, some of our fixed price contracts do not allow us to adjust our prices and, as a result, increases in material or fuel costs could reduce our profitability with respect to such projects.
our intellectual property rights may be unenforceable or become obsolete.
we utilize a variety of intellectual property rights while performing our services. we view our portfolio of proprietary energized services tools and techniques and other process and design technologies as competitive strengths, which we believe differentiate our service offerings. we also license certain technologies from third parties, and there is a risk that our relationships with such licensors may terminate or expire or may be interrupted or harmed. we may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future, and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states. if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, or if intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings succeed against us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced. further, if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete, we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors and our customers with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.
investors and other interested constituencies have focused increasingly on the environmental, social and governance (esg) practices of companies. while we have programs and initiatives in place related to our esg practices, investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of our practices. in addition, our customers may require that we implement certain additional esg procedures or standards before they will continue to do business with us. a failure to comply with investor or customer expectations and standards, which are evolving, or if we are perceived to not have responded appropriately to the growing concern for esg issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, could also cause reputational harm to our business and could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters, and unfavorable ratings of quanta or our industries may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our costs of capital.
risks related to regulation and compliance regulatory requirements applicable to our industries and changes in current and potential legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect demand for our services.
because the vast majority of our revenue is derived from a few industries, the federal, state, provincial and local regulations affecting those industries, including, among other things, environmental, safety, and permitting requirements, have a material effect on our business. in recent years, our customers have faced heightened regulatory requirements and increased regulatory enforcement, which have resulted in delays, reductions in scope and cancellations of projects. furthermore, certain regulatory requirements applicable to our customers are also required of us when we contract with such customers, and our inability to meet those requirements could also result in decreased demand for our services. increased regulatory requirements have negatively impacted us and our customers and decreased demand for our services in the past, and may do so in the future, which can adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
concerns about climate-related issues could potentially result in new legislation, regulation, regulatory actions or other requirements at the local, state or federal level, any of which could negatively affect our customers and decrease demand for their services, result in increased costs associated with our operations, or impact the prices we charge our customers. for example, requirements to reduce, or taxes on the production and/or consumption of, fossil fuels could negatively impact the hydrocarbon production volumes of our customers, which could in turn negatively impact demand for our services. new regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources could also significantly increase our costs in light of our large rolling-stock fleet. in addition, if our operations are perceived to result in high greenhouse gas emissions, our reputation could suffer.
additionally, current and potential legislative or regulatory initiatives may not result in incremental increased demand for our services, including legislation and regulation that mandate percentages of power to be generated from renewable sources, require utilities to meet reliability standards, and encourage installation of new electric power transmission and renewable energy generation facilities. while these actions and initiatives have positively impacted demand for our services in the past, it is not certain whether they will continue to do so in the future. it is also uncertain as to whether proposed legislative initiatives that could be beneficial for our industries, including those designed to ease regulatory and permitting requirements, will be enacted.
our unionized workforce and related obligations may adversely affect our operations.
as of december 31, 2019, approximately 35% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. for a variety of reasons, our unionized workforce could adversely impact relationships with our customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. for instance, although the majority of the collective bargaining agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages, certain of our unionized employees have participated in strikes and work stoppages in the past, and we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur in the future. our ability to complete future acquisitions also could be adversely affected because of our union status, including because our union agreements may be incompatible with the union agreements of a business we want to acquire or because a business we want to acquire may not want to become affiliated with a union-based company. additionally, certain of our customers require or prefer a non-union workforce, and they may reduce the amount of work assigned to us if our non-union labor crews become unionized.
our collective bargaining agreements generally require us to participate with other companies in multiemployer pension plans. to the extent a plan is underfunded, we may be subject to substantial liabilities if we withdraw or are deemed to withdraw from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal. for example, we have been involved in several litigation matters associated with our withdrawal from the central states, southeast and southwest areas pension plan, certain of which were settled in 2017. further, special funding and operational rules are generally applicable to multiemployer plans that are classified as "endangered," "seriously endangered" or "critical" status based on multiple factors (including, for example, the plan's funded percentage, cash flow position and whether it is projected to experience a minimum funding deficiency). plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status, which may require additional contributions from employers (e.g., a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. certain plans to which we contribute or may contribute in the future are in "endangered," "seriously endangered" or "critical" status, and we may be obligated to contribute material amounts to these plans in the future, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we could be adversely affected by our failure to comply with the laws applicable to our foreign activities.
applicable u.s. and non-u.s. anti-corruption laws, including but not limited to the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa), prohibit us from, among other things, corruptly making payments to non-u.s. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. we pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption, and in certain circumstances, compliance with these laws may conflict with local customs and practices. our policies mandate compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws and our procedures and practices are designed to ensure that our employees and intermediaries comply with these laws. however, there can be no assurance that such policies, procedures and practices will protect us from liability under the fcpa or other similar laws for actions or inadvertences by our employees or intermediaries. liability for such actions or inadvertences could result in severe criminal or civil fines, penalties, forfeitures, disgorgements or other sanctions. this in turn could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. in addition, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of such laws can be expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management, in-country management, and other personnel.
compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.
we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. new tax laws, treaties and regulations and changes in existing tax laws, treaties and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, which can result in significant changes to the tax rate on our earnings and have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations. in addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities, and our tax estimates and tax positions could be materially affected by many factors, including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, our ability to realize deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. a significant increase in our tax rate can have a material adverse effect on our profitability and liquidity.
our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant liabilities and increased costs.
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including those dealing with the handling and disposal of waste products, pcbs, fuel storage, water quality and air quality. we perform work in many different types of underground environments. if the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate, or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps, our underground work could strike objects in the soil, some of which may contain pollutants. these objects may also rupture, resulting in the discharge of pollutants. in such circumstances, we may be liable for fines and damages, and we may be unable to obtain reimbursement from the parties providing the incorrect information. we perform work, including directional drilling, in and around environmentally sensitive areas such as rivers, lakes and wetlands. due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies, it is possible that such work may cause the release of subsurface materials that contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law, potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines. we also own and lease facilities that contain above- and below-ground fuel storage tanks. if these tanks were to leak, we could be responsible for remediation costs and fines. the obligations, liabilities, fines and costs associated with these and other events can be material and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. moreover, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities.
in certain instances, we have obtained indemnification and other rights from third parties (including predecessors or lessors) for such obligations and liabilities; however, these indemnities may not cover all of our costs and indemnitors may not pay amounts owed to us. further, in connection with an acquisition, we cannot be certain that we identify all potential environmental liabilities relating to any acquired business when we are negotiating an indemnification right.
certain regulatory requirements applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries could materially impact our business.
we are subject to various specific regulatory regimes and requirements that could result in significant compliance costs and liabilities. as a public company, we are subject to the corporate governance and financial reporting requirements of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, including requirements for management to report on our internal controls over financial reporting and for our independent registered public accounting firm to express an opinion on the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. our internal controls over financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2019; however, there can be no assurance that our internal controls over financial reporting will be determined to be effective in future years. failure to maintain effective internal controls or to identify significant internal control deficiencies in acquired businesses (both prior acquisitions and future acquisitions) could result in a decrease in the market value of our publicly traded securities, a reduced ability to obtain debt and equity financing, a loss of customers, fines or penalties, and/or additional expenditures to meet the requirements or remedy any deficiencies.
one of our subsidiaries has registered as an investment adviser with the sec under the u.s. investment advisers act of 1940, as amended (the advisers act). the advisers act and the rules promulgated thereunder impose substantive and material restrictions and requirements on the operations of this subsidiary, including certain fiduciary duties that apply to its relationships with its advisory clients. the sec has broad administrative powers to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the advisers act, ranging from fines and censures to termination of an adviser's registration. this subsidiary is also subject to periodic sec examinations and other requirements, including, among other things, maintaining an effective compliance program, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements and complying with anti-fraud prohibitions. the failure of our subsidiary to comply with the requirements of the advisers act could result in fines, suspensions of individual employees or other sanctions against our subsidiary that could have a material adverse effect on us. even if an investigation or proceeding does not result in a fine or sanction or if a fine or sanction imposed against our subsidiary or its employees were small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to an investigation, proceeding or imposition of these fines or sanctions could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on us.
our wholly-owned captive insurance company is a registered insurance broker with the texas department of insurance, and therefore is subject to various rules and regulations and required to meet certain capital requirements, which can result in additional use of our resources.
we own and operate a postsecondary educational institution that specializes in pre-apprenticeship training, apprenticeship training and specialized utility task training for electric workers, as well as training for the pipeline and industrial and communications industries. in order to operate, each of the institution's campuses must be authorized by the state education agency where the campus is located, and the level of regulatory oversight varies substantially by state and can be extensive. if any of our campuses fail to comply with state licensing requirements, they may be unable to offer their programs and forced to close, which could result in harm to our reputation or negatively impact our ability to train skilled personnel that can be utilized to support our industry. additionally, because our institution operates in a highly regulated industry, it is subject to compliance reviews and lawsuits or claims by government agencies and third parties. if the results of these reviews or proceedings are unfavorable to us, we may be required to pay significant monetary damages or be subject to fines, limitations on the operations of the institution, injunctions or other penalties. the postsecondary educational institution is also accredited by the accrediting commission of career schools and colleges. loss of accreditation could result in reputational harm or student-initiated litigation or negatively impact our ability to train skilled personnel that can be utilized to support our business.
we collect and retain information about our customers, stockholders, vendors and employees. new legislation and regulatory requirements, as well as contractual commitments, affect how we must store, use, transfer and process the confidential information of our employees, customers, vendors and stockholders. for example, the california consumer privacy act (the ccpa) was signed into law in 2018 and largely took effect in january 2020. the ccpa, among other things, contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about california residents and enhanced consumer protections for those individuals, and provides for statutory fines for data security breaches or other ccpa violations. meanwhile, over fifteen other states have considered privacy laws like the ccpa. these laws, as well as other new or changing legislative, regulatory or contractual requirements concerning data privacy and protection, could require us to expend significant additional compliance costs, and any failure to comply with such requirements can result in significant liability or harm to our reputation.
opportunities within the government arena could subject us to increased regulation and costs and may pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance.
most government contracts are awarded through a regulated competitive bidding process, which can often be more time consuming than the bidding process for non-governmental projects. additionally, involvement with government contracts could require a significant amount of costs to be incurred before any revenues are realized. we are also subject to numerous procurement rules and other public sector regulations when we contract with certain governmental agencies, any deemed violation of which could lead to fines or penalties or a loss of business. government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors. government agencies may review a contractor's performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. if a government agency determines that costs were improperly allocated to specific contracts, such costs will not be reimbursed or a refund of previously reimbursed costs may be required. if a government agency alleges or proves improper activity, civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and serious reputational harm could result. many government contracts must be appropriated each year, and without re-appropriation we would not realize all of the potential revenues from any awarded contracts.
additionally, u.s. government shutdowns or any related under-staffing of the government departments or agencies that interact with our business could result in program cancellations, disruptions and/or stop work orders, could limit the government's ability to effectively progress programs and make timely payments, and could limit our ability to perform on our existing u.s. government contracts and successfully compete for new work.
immigration laws, including our inability to verify employment eligibility and restrictions on movement of our foreign employees, could adversely affect our business or reputation.
we employ a significant number of employees, and while we utilize processes to assist in verifying the employment eligibility of potential new employees so that we maintain compliance with applicable laws, it is possible some of our employees may be unauthorized workers. in addition, we utilize certain non-immigrant visas to allow us to temporarily transfer certain of our foreign employees to the united states. the employment of unauthorized workers or failure to comply with the requirements of these non-immigrant visas could subject us to fines, penalties and other costs, as well as result in adverse publicity that negatively impacts our reputation and brand and may make it more difficult to hire and retain qualified employees. furthermore, to the extent we are subject to penalties that prevent the future transfer of our foreign employees to the united states, we may incur additional costs to hire and train new employees. immigration laws have also been an area of considerable political focus in recent years, and, from time-to-time, the u.s. government considers or implements changes to federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs. changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and potential liability and make our hiring and employee transfer processes more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees.
we may incur additional healthcare costs.
the costs of employee health care insurance in the u.s. has increased in recent years due to rising health care costs, legislative changes, and general economic conditions. we cannot predict what other health care legislation or regulations will be implemented at the federal or state level, including whether the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 will be repealed and/or replaced, or the impact of any such future legislation or regulations. a continued increase in health care costs or related costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
risks related to financing our business we may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth and operations.
if we cannot secure future funds or financing on acceptable terms or generate sufficient cash flow, we may be unable to support our future operations or growth strategy. the timing of our funding needs and the size of our operations and strategic initiatives that require capital cannot be readily predicted and may be substantial. the use of cash on hand, cash from operations and cash from our senior secured credit facility to fund these initiatives can limit our financial flexibility and increase our need to seek capital through additional debt or equity financings. we also rely on financing companies to fund the leasing of certain of our equipment, and credit market conditions may restrict access to capital for the leasing of additional equipment. a lack of available capital to fund the leasing of equipment could negatively impact our future operations.
the credit agreement for our senior secured credit facility contains certain restrictions, including financial covenants and other restrictions on our ability to borrow amounts under the agreement and limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or conduct certain types of preferred equity financings. our ability to increase the current commitments under our senior secured credit facility is also dependent upon additional commitments from our lenders. furthermore, if we are permitted to seek additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain they will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, as banks are often restrictive in their lending practices, and additional debt financing may include covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility. if we are unable to borrow under our senior secured credit facility or secure other financing or if our lenders become unable or unwilling to fund their commitments to us, we may not be able to access the capital needed to fund our growth and operations. for additional information on the terms of our senior secured credit facility, please read item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - debt instruments - credit facility.
additionally, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past, and may fluctuate significantly in the future, in response to various factors, including events beyond our control, which could impact our ability to utilize capital markets to obtain funds. a variety of events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including overall market conditions or volatility, actual or perceived negative financial results or other unfavorable information relating to us or our market peers, and the other risks described in this annual report.
our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk.
borrowings under our credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. if interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even if the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. our weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt for the year ended december 31, 2019 was 3.8%. the annual effect on our pretax earnings of a hypothetical 50 basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates would be approximately $6.7 million based on our december 31, 2019 balance of variable rate debt.
additionally, to address the transition in financial markets away from the london interest bank offered rate (libor) by the end of 2021, our senior secured credit facility agreement includes provisions related to the replacement of libor with a libor successor rate (as defined in the credit agreement for such facility). changing to an alternative interest rate may lead to additional volatility in interest rates and could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. if no libor successor rate has been determined at the time certain circumstances are present, the lenders' obligation to make or maintain loans based on a eurocurrency rate could be suspended, and loans in u.s. dollars would default to the base rate (as described in senior secured credit facility within note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data) rather than a rate using the eurocurrency rate. if this were to occur, our available liquidity and cash flows could be negatively impacted.
we may be unable to compete for certain projects if we are not able to obtain surety bonds, letters of credit or bank guarantees.
a portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other financial assurances. current or future market conditions, including losses incurred in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate bankruptcies, as well as changes in our sureties' assessment of our operating and financial risk, could cause our surety providers and lenders to decline to issue or renew, or substantially reduce the amount of, bid or performance bonds for our work and could increase our costs associated with collateral. these actions could be taken on short notice. if our surety providers or lenders were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding, letters of credit or guarantees, our alternatives would include seeking capacity from other sureties and lenders or finding more business that does not require bonds or that allows for other forms of collateral for project performance, such as cash. we may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all, which could affect our ability to bid for or work on future projects requiring financial assurances.
we have also granted security interests in certain assets to collateralize our obligations to our sureties and lenders. furthermore, under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or continue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing bonds. if we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of these or other reasons, we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects that require bonding.
our ability to access capital markets could be limited.
from time to time, we may need to access capital markets to obtain financing. our ability to access capital markets for financing could be limited by, among other things, our existing capital structure, our credit ratings, the state of the economy, the health of our industries, and the liquidity of the capital markets. many of the factors that affect our ability to access capital markets are outside of our control. no assurance can be given that we will be able to access capital markets on terms acceptable to us when required to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
risks related to our common stock our sale or issuance of additional common stock or other equity-related securities could dilute each stockholder's ownership interest or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
we often fund a significant portion of the consideration paid in connection with our acquisitions with the issuance of additional equity securities, including contingent consideration amounts payable if acquired businesses achieve certain performance objectives during specified post-acquisition periods. we also utilize stock-based compensation as a key component of our compensation program. we expect to issue additional equity securities in the future in connection with these and other practices. our restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may issue up to 600,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 142,324,318 shares were outstanding as of december 31, 2019. any additional issuances of common stock would have the effect of diluting our earnings per share and our existing stockholders' individual ownership percentages and lead to volatility in the market price of our common stock. we cannot predict the effect that future issuances of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock.
there can be no assurance that we will declare or pay future dividends on our common stock.
the declaration, amount and timing of future dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and applicable agreements. our ability to declare and pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, current and anticipated expansion plans, requirements under delaware law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a material negative effect on our stock price.
certain provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult.
the following provisions of our charter documents, as currently in effect, and delaware law could discourage potential proposals to acquire us, delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock:
•   our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue "blank check" preferred stock and to adopt amendments to our bylaws;
•   our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings;
•   our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to act by written consent; and
•   we are subject to provisions of delaware law which restrict us from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years following the date such stockholder became classified as an interested stockholder.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. the discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are based upon our current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to inaccurate assumptions and known or unknown risks and uncertainties, including those identified in uncertainty of forward-looking statements and information below and item 1a. risk factors.
overview we are a leading provider of specialty contracting services, delivering comprehensive infrastructure solutions for the electric power, energy and communications industries in the united states, canada, australia and select other international markets. the performance of our business generally depends on our ability to obtain contracts with customers and to effectively deliver the services provided under those contracts. the services we provide include the design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of infrastructure within each of the industries we serve, such as electric power transmission and distribution networks; substation facilities; pipeline transmission and distribution systems and facilities; refinery, petrochemical and industrial facilities; and telecommunications and cable multi-system operator networks. our customers include many of the leading companies in the industries we serve, and we endeavor to develop and maintain strategic alliances and preferred service provider status with our customers. our services are typically provided pursuant to master service agreements, repair and maintenance contracts and fixed price and non-fixed price installation contracts.
we report our results under two reportable segments: (1) electric power infrastructure services and (2) pipeline and industrial infrastructure services, as further described in item 1. business - reportable segments. this structure is generally focused on broad end-user markets for our services. included within the electric power infrastructure services segment are the results related to our telecommunications infrastructure services.
current year financial results and significant operational trends and events key financial results for the year ended december 31, 2019 included:
•   consolidated revenues increased 8.4% to $12.11 billion as compared to $11.17 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018, of which 59% was attributable to the electric power infrastructure services segment and 41% was attributable to the pipeline and industrial infrastructure services segment;
•   operating income increased 2.7%, or $14.6 million, to $554.9 million as compared to $540.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2018;
•   net income attributable to common stock increased 37.1%, or $108.7 million, to $402.0 million as compared to $293.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2018;
•   diluted earnings per share increased 43.7%, or $0.83, to $2.73 as compared to $1.90 for the year ended december 31, 2018;
•   net cash provided by operating activities increased 46.8%, or $167.8 million, to $526.6 million as compared to $358.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2018;
•   remaining performance obligations increased 13.3%, or $621.0 million, to $5.30 billion as of december 31, 2019 as compared to $4.68 billion as of december 31, 2018; and
•   total backlog (a non-gaap measure) increased 21.6%, or $2.66 billion, to $15.00 billion as of december 31, 2019 as compared to $12.34 billion as of december 31, 2018. for a reconciliation of backlog to remaining performance obligations, its most comparable gaap measure, see remaining performance obligations and backlog below.
during 2019, our electric power infrastructure services segment was impacted by the following significant operational trends and events:
•   increased customer spending on smaller electric transmission and distribution services projects, including increased revenues in the western united states associated with grid modernization and accelerated fire hardening programs, which are services we generally consider to be base business operations;
•   decreased revenues on larger transmission projects primarily due to the completion of a larger transmission project in canada in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to full construction on the project throughout 2018;
•   delays on other larger transmission projects in canada, which shifted expected revenues from 2019 to 2020 and beyond; and
•   recognition of a $79.2 million charge related to the termination of a large telecommunications project in peru.
during 2019, our pipeline and industrial infrastructure services segment was impacted by the following significant operational trends and events:
•   increased customer spending on gas utility infrastructure replacement and modernization initiatives, pipeline integrity work, industrial services and other services that we generally consider to be base business operations;
•   improved operating income margins across our transmission, distribution and industrial services operations resulting from improved execution and utilization;
•   decreased revenues from larger pipeline projects as compared to 2018, the timing of which is highly variable due to potential permitting delays, worksite access limitations related to environmental regulations and seasonal weather patterns; and
•   recognition of a $28.3 million project loss associated with engineering and production delays on a substantially complete processing facility project, which negatively impacted operating income and was partially offset by favorable change orders and insurance settlements on other projects during 2019.
during 2019, our results were also impacted by the following significant events, the gross amounts related to which are recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates included in "other income (expense), net" in our consolidated statements of operations:
•   recognition of $60.3 million ($43.9 million net of tax) of previously deferred earnings as a result of the completion of the larger transmission project in canada referenced above; and
•   recognition of a $13.0 million gain ($20.7 million with favorable tax benefits) related to the sale of our interest in the same large electric transmission project in canada.
we also continue to selectively evaluate acquisitions as part of our overall business strategy and acquired seven businesses in 2019, including the hallen construction co., inc. (hallen), a business that specializes in above-ground and underground gas distribution and transmission services in the northeastern united states. during 2019, revenues were positively impacted by approximately $305 million from acquired businesses.
business environment we believe there are growth opportunities across the industries we serve and continue to have a positive long-term outlook. although not without risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in uncertainty of forward-looking statements and information and included in item 1a. risk factors, we believe, with our full-service operations, broad geographic reach, financial position and technical expertise, we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities and trends in our industries.
electric power infrastructure services segment. utilities are investing significant capital in their electric power delivery systems, particularly transmission, substation and distribution infrastructure, through multi-year, multi-billion dollar grid modernization and reliability programs, which have provided, and are expected to continue to provide, demand for our services. utilities are accommodating a changing fuel generation mix that is moving toward more sustainable sources such as natural gas and renewables and replacing aging infrastructure to support long-term economic growth. in order to reliably and efficiently deliver power, and in response to federal reliability standards, utilities are also integrating smart grid technologies into distribution systems in order to improve grid management and create efficiencies, and in preparation for emerging technologies such as electric vehicles. a number of utilities are also implementing system upgrades or hardening programs in response to recurring severe weather events, such as hurricanes and wildfires. in particular, current system resiliency initiatives in california and other regions in the western u.s. are designed to prevent and manage the impact of wildfires. however, while these resiliency initiatives also provide opportunities for our services, they also increase our potential exposure to significant liabilities attributable to those events.
we expect demand for electricity in north america to grow over the long term and believe that certain segments of the north american electric power grid are not adequate to efficiently serve the power needs of the future. as demand for power increases, we also expect an increase in new power generation facilities powered by certain traditional energy sources (e.g., natural gas) and renewable energy sources (e.g., solar and wind). to the extent this dynamic continues, we expect continued demand for new or expanded transmission and substation infrastructure to transport power and interconnect new generation facilities and the modification and reengineering of existing infrastructure as existing coal and nuclear generation facilities are retired or shut down.
with respect to our communications service offerings, consumer and commercial demand for communication and data-intensive, high-bandwidth wireline and wireless services and applications is driving significant investment in infrastructure and the deployment of new technologies. in particular, communications providers in north america are in the early stages of developing new fifth generation wireless services (5g), which are intended to facilitate bandwidth-intensive services at high speeds for consumers and a wide range of commercial applications. as a result of these industry trends, we believe there will be meaningful demand for our services in that market. while we continue to perform certain electric power and communications services in latin america, we have completed a strategic review of those operations, and due to circumstances experienced in connection with the termination of the large telecommunications project in peru during 2019 and political volatility in other areas of the region, have concluded to pursue an orderly exit of our latin american operations. while we expect additional costs in the near-term related to exiting these operations, we anticipate this decision will result in improved profitability of our overall services offerings.
pipeline and industrial infrastructure services segment. we have experienced an increase in demand for our gas utility distribution services as a result of improved economic conditions, lower natural gas prices, regulatory requirements and customer desire to upgrade and replace aging infrastructure. we believe there are also growth opportunities for our pipeline integrity, rehabilitation and replacement services, as regulatory measures have increased the frequency or stringency of pipeline integrity testing requirements.
we provide critical path solutions and related specialty services to refinery and chemical processing facilities, primarily along the gulf coast of the united states and in other select markets in north america. trends and estimates for process facility utilization rates and overall refining capacity show north america as the largest downstream maintenance market in the world over the next several years, and we believe processing facilities located along the u.s. gulf coast region should have certain strategic advantages due to their proximity to affordable hydrocarbon resources. while our high-pressure and critical-path turnaround services can be negatively impacted in the short term by severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tropical storms and floods, we expect these favorable industry dynamics to provide near-term and longer-term opportunities for these services, as well as our capabilities with respect to instrumentation, high-voltage and other electrical services, piping, fabrication and storage, and other industrial services.
additionally, a number of larger pipeline projects from the north american shale formations and canadian oil sands to power plants, refineries, liquefied natural gas (lng) export facilities and other demand centers are in various stages of development. while there is risk the projects will not move forward or be delayed, we believe many of our customers remain committed to them given the cost and time required to move from conception to construction. the larger pipeline market is cyclical and the contribution of these projects to our revenues has declined over the last few years. we currently expect a further reduction in revenues from larger pipeline projects in 2020; however, we are pursuing various opportunities that, if successful, could cause our current expectations to increase. due to its abundant supply and current low price, we also believe natural gas will remain a fuel of choice for both primary power generation and backup power generation for renewable-driven power plants in north america. the favorable characteristics of natural gas also position the united states as a leading competitor in the global lng export market, which has the potential to continue to grow over the coming years as approved and proposed lng export facilities are developed. in certain areas, the existing pipeline system infrastructure is insufficient to support these expected future developments, which could provide additional opportunities for our services.
although much of our pipeline and industrial infrastructure services are influenced by hydrocarbon production volume rather than shorter-term changes in commodity prices, the broader oil and gas industry is highly cyclical and subject to price volatility, which can impact demand for our services. for example, certain of our end markets where the price of oil is influential, such as australia, the canadian oil sands and certain oil-driven u.s. shale formations, have been materially impacted and remain challenged, as the broader energy market has not fully recovered from the significant decline in oil prices that occurred in 2014 and 2015.
regulatory challenges and opportunities. the regulatory environment creates both challenges and opportunities for our business. certain regulatory and environmental permitting processes continue to create uncertainty for projects and negatively impact customer spending. in recent years, electric power and pipeline infrastructure services margins have been impacted by regulatory and permitting delays, particularly with respect to larger electric transmission and larger pipeline projects. we believe that several existing, pending or proposed legislative or regulatory actions may alleviate certain of these issues and positively impact long-term demand, particularly in connection with electric power infrastructure and renewable energy spending. for example, regulatory changes affecting siting and right-of-way processes could potentially accelerate construction for transmission projects, and state and federal reliability standards are creating incentives for system investment and maintenance. we also consider renewable energy, including solar and wind generation facilities, to be an ongoing opportunity for our engineering, project management and installation services; however, the economic feasibility of some of these projects remains subject to the continued availability of tax incentive programs.
labor resource availability. our customers are seeking additional specialized labor resources to address an aging utility workforce and labor availability issues, increasing pressure to reduce costs and improve reliability, and increasing duration and complexity of their capital programs. we believe these trends will continue, possibly to the point where demand for labor resources will outpace supply. furthermore, the cyclical nature of the natural gas and oil industry can create shortages of qualified labor in those markets during periods of high demand. our ability to capitalize on available opportunities is limited by our ability to employ, train and retain the necessary skilled personnel, and we are taking proactive steps to develop our workforce, including through strategic relationships with universities, the military and unions and the expansion and development of our training facility and postsecondary educational institution. although we believe these initiatives will help address workforce needs, meeting our customers' demand for labor resources could remain challenging.
acquisitions and investments. we believe potential acquisition and investment opportunities exist in our industries and adjacent industries, primarily due to the highly fragmented and evolving nature of those industries and inability of many companies to expand and modernize due to capital or liquidity constraints. we continue to evaluate opportunities that are expected to, among other things, broaden our customer base, expand our geographic area of operations, and grow and diversify our portfolio of services.
significant factors impacting results our revenues, margins and other results of operations can be influenced by a variety of factors in any given period, including those described in item 1a. risk factors and in results of operations and uncertainty of forward looking statements and information, and those factors have caused fluctuations in our results in the past and are expected to cause fluctuations in our results in the future. additional information with respect to certain of those factors is provided below.
seasonality. typically, our revenues are lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold, snowy or wet conditions can create challenging working environments that are more costly for our customers or cause delays on projects. in addition, infrastructure projects often do not begin in a meaningful way until our customers finalize their capital budgets, which typically occurs during the first quarter. second quarter revenues are typically higher than those in the first quarter, as some projects begin, but continued cold and wet weather can often impact productivity. third quarter revenues are typically the highest of the year, as a greater number of projects are underway and operating conditions, including weather, are normally more accommodating. generally, revenues during the fourth quarter are lower than the third quarter but higher than the second quarter, as many projects are completed and customers often seek to spend their capital budgets before year end. however, the holiday season and inclement weather can sometimes cause delays during the fourth quarter, reducing revenues and increasing costs. these seasonal impacts are typical for our u.s. operations, but seasonality for our international operations may differ. for example, revenues in canada are typically higher in the first quarter because projects are often accelerated in order to complete work while the ground is frozen and prior to the break up, or seasonal thaw, as productivity is adversely affected by wet ground conditions during warmer months.
weather and natural disasters. the results of our business in a given period can be impacted by adverse weather conditions, severe weather events or natural disasters, which include, among other things, heavy or prolonged snowfall or rainfall, hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, floods, blizzards, extreme temperatures, wildfires, pandemics and earthquakes. these conditions and events can negatively impact our financial results due to the termination, deferral or delay of projects, reduced productivity and exposure to significant liabilities. however, in some cases, severe weather events can increase our emergency restoration services, which typically yield higher margins due in part to higher equipment utilization and absorption of fixed costs.
cyclicality and demand for services. our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines or delays in new projects due to cyclicality, which may vary by geographic region. project schedules also fluctuate, particularly in connection with larger, more complex or longer-term projects, which can affect the amount of work performed in a given period. for example, the timing of obtaining permits and other approvals on a larger project may be delayed, and we may need to maintain a portion of our workforce and equipment in an underutilized capacity to ensure we are strategically positioned to deliver on the project when it moves forward. examples of other items that may cause demand for our services to fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter include: the financial condition of our customers and their access to capital; economic and political conditions on a regional, national or global scale, including changes in u.s. and global trade relationships and interest rates; our customers' capital spending, including on larger pipeline and electrical infrastructure projects; commodity and material prices; and project cancellations.
revenue mix. the mix of revenues based on the types of services we provide in a given period will impact margins, as certain industries and services provide higher-margin opportunities. for example, installation work is often performed on a fixed price basis, while maintenance work is often performed under pre-established or negotiated prices or cost-plus pricing arrangements. margins for installation work varies by project but can be higher than maintenance work due to higher risk. we have historically derived approximately 30% to 35% of our annual revenues from maintenance work, but a higher portion of maintenance work in any given period may affect our gross margins for that period. additionally, the areas in which we operate during a given period can impact margins. some areas offer the opportunity for higher margins due to their more difficult geographic characteristics, such as urban settings or mountainous and other difficult terrain. however, margins may also be negatively impacted by unexpected difficulties that can arise due to those same characteristics, as well as unexpected site conditions.
size, scope and complexity of projects. larger or more complex projects with higher voltage capacities; larger diameter throughput capacities; increased engineering, design or construction complexities; more difficult terrain requirements; or longer distance requirements typically yield opportunities for higher margins as we assume a greater degree of performance risk and there is greater utilization of our resources for longer construction timeframes. furthermore, smaller or less complex projects typically have a greater number of companies competing for them, and competitors at times may more aggressively pursue available work. a greater percentage of smaller scale or less complex work also could negatively impact margins due to the inefficiency of transitioning between a larger number of smaller projects versus continuous production on fewer larger projects. also, at times we may choose to maintain a portion of our workforce and equipment in an underutilized capacity to ensure we are strategically positioned to deliver on larger projects when they move forward.
project variability and performance. margins for a single project may fluctuate period to period due to changes in the volume or type of work performed, the pricing structure under the project contract or job productivity. additionally, our productivity and performance on a project can vary period to period based on a number of factors, including unexpected project difficulties or site conditions; project location, including locations with challenging operating conditions; whether the work is on an open or encumbered right of way; inclement weather or severe weather events; environmental restrictions or regulatory delays; protests, other political activity or legal challenges related to a project; and the performance of third parties.
subcontract work and provision of materials. work that is subcontracted to other service providers generally yields lower margins, and therefore an increase in subcontract work in a given period can decrease margins. in recent years, we have subcontracted approximately 15% to 20% of our work to other service providers. our customers are usually responsible for supplying the materials for their projects; however, under some contracts we agree to procure all or part of the required materials. margins may be lower on projects where we furnish a significant amount of materials, including projects where we provide engineering, procurement and construction (epc) services, as our markup on materials is generally lower than our markup on labor costs. furthermore, fluctuations in the price of materials we procure, including as a result of changes in u.s. or global trade relationships or other economic or political conditions, may impact our margins. in a given period, an increase in the percentage of work with higher materials procurement requirements may decrease our overall margins.
foreign currency risk. our financial performance is reported on a u.s. dollar-denominated basis but is partially subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. fluctuations in exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar, primarily canadian and australian dollars, can materially impact margins and comparisons of our results of operations between periods.
results of operations the results of acquired businesses have been included in the following results of operations beginning on their respective acquisition dates. a discussion of results of operations changes between the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 is included in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018, which was filed with the sec on february 28, 2019. the following table sets forth selected statements of operations data, such data as a percentage of revenues for the years indicated as well as the dollar and percentage change from the prior year (dollars in thousands):

* the percentage change is not meaningful.
revenues. contributing to the increase were incremental revenues of $706.3 million from electric power infrastructure services and $234.5 million from pipeline and industrial infrastructure services. see segment results below for additional information and discussion related to segment revenues.
gross profit. the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the overall increase in revenues described above and margin improvement in pipeline and industrial infrastructure services, partially offset by a decline in margins for electric power infrastructure services. see segment results below for additional information and discussion related to segment operating income (loss).
selling, general and administrative expenses. the increase was primarily attributable to a $29.9 million increase in compensation expenses, largely associated with higher salaries due to increased personnel to support business growth and annual compensation increases; a $23.4 million increase in expenses associated with acquired businesses, including incremental acquisition and integration costs of $7.5 million; and a $15.6 million increase in professional fees. also contributing to the increase were a $9.6 million increase in information systems-related expenses to support business growth; a $9.3 million increase in deferred compensation expense, which was primarily associated with market value changes; a $7.7 million increase in travel expenses and a $4.1 million increase in bad debt expense. these increases were partially offset by a $9.1 million increase in net gains on the sale of property and equipment.
amortization of intangible assets. the increase was primarily due to increased amortization of intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses, partially offset by reduced amortization expense from previously acquired intangible assets, as certain of those assets became fully amortized.
asset impairment charges. during the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018, we recognized $13.9 million and $49.4 million of asset impairment charges. the 2019 charges primarily related to the winding down and exit of certain oil-influenced operations and assets, the replacement of an internally-developed software application and the planned sale of certain foreign operations and assets, while the 2018 charges primarily related to the winding down of certain oil-influenced operations and assets.
change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. the overall change was primarily due to changes in performance in post-acquisition periods for certain acquired businesses and the effect of present value accretion on fair value calculations. further changes in fair value are expected to be recorded periodically until contingent consideration liabilities are settled. see contractual obligations - contingent consideration liabilities for more information.
interest expense. interest expense increased primarily due to increased borrowing activity and a higher weighted average interest rate.
other income (expense), net. the change was primarily related to our equity investment in a limited partnership that built, owned and operated the large electric transmission project in canada that was substantially completed and placed into commercial operation during the three months ended march 31, 2019. as a result of the project completion, we recognized $60.3 million of earnings that were previously deferred as a component of "other income (expense), net" in prior periods, the majority of which were deferred in the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017. additionally, during the three months ended december 31, 2019, we recognized a gain of $13.0 million related to the sale of our interest in this limited partnership. the net expense recognized in the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily related to the deferral of earnings on the same project.
provision for income taxes. the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 were 28.9% and 35.3%. the higher effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily due to the impact of tax reform regulations issued during 2018, which resulted in a $37.2 million valuation allowance against certain tax benefits recognized during 2017 associated with the tax act and other entity restructuring and recapitalization efforts. the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2019 includes the impact of a $79.2 million charge associated with the termination of a large telecommunications project in peru, for which no income tax benefit was recognized, partially offset by $7.8 million of favorable tax benefits associated with the sale of our interest in the limited partnership referenced above. we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 29.8% to 30.3% for 2020. for additional information regarding the tax act, refer to note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. the gain in the year ended december 31, 2019 resulted from the translation of the balance sheet positions of our international operations, primarily in canada and australia, as of december 31, 2019 as compared to december 31, 2018, and the impact of the strengthening of those foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar as of december 31, 2019. the loss in the year ended december 31, 2018 resulted from the translation of the balance sheet positions of our international operations, primarily in canada and australia, as of december 31, 2018 as compared to december 31, 2017, and the impact of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against those foreign currencies as of december 31, 2018.
segment results reportable segment information, including revenues and operating income by type of work, is gathered from each operating unit for the purpose of evaluating segment performance. classification of our operating unit revenues by type of work for segment reporting purposes can at times require judgment on the part of management. our operating units may perform joint projects for customers in multiple industries, deliver multiple types of services under a single customer contract or provide service offerings to various industries. for example, we perform joint trenching projects to install distribution lines for electric power and natural gas customers. our integrated operations and common administrative support for operating units require that certain allocations be made to determine segment profitability, including allocations of shared and indirect costs (e.g., facility costs), indirect operating expenses (e.g., depreciation), and general and administrative costs. certain corporate costs are not allocated, including payroll and benefits, employee travel expenses, facility costs, professional fees, acquisition costs, non-cash stock-based compensation, amortization related to intangible assets, asset impairment related to goodwill and intangible assets and change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities.

electric power infrastructure services segment results the increase in revenues was primarily due to increased customer spending on smaller transmission and distribution services, including increased revenues in the western united states associated with grid modernization and accelerated fire hardening programs. revenues also increased due to growth in our communications operations and $140 million was attributable to acquired businesses. these increases were partially offset by lower revenues on the larger transmission project in canada that was substantially completed during the three months ended march 31, 2019 but was in full construction throughout 2018; a $51 million decrease in emergency restoration services revenues; and less favorable foreign currency exchange rates, which negatively impacted revenues by approximately $32 million and were primarily attributable to the relationship between the u.s. dollar and the canadian and australian dollars.
as referenced in current year financial results and significant operational trends and events, during the year ended december 31, 2019, we recognized a $79.2 million charge associated with the termination of a telecommunications project in peru, which included a $48.8 million reversal of revenues and a $30.4 million increase in cost of services. the charge included a reduction of previously recognized earnings on the project, a reserve against a portion of alleged liquidated damages and recognition of estimated costs to complete the project turnover and close out the project. as a result of the contract termination and other factors, we have concluded to pursue an orderly exit of our operations in latin america and have modified our segment disclosures in the above table to separately identify the latin american results. we believe that providing visibility into these results is beneficial to understanding the performance of our ongoing operations. see legal proceedings in note 14 below for additional information involving the termination of the telecommunications project in peru.
the increase in segment operating income excluding latin america was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues from smaller transmission and distribution services described above, including increased customer spending on fire hardening programs, as well as growth in our communications operations. the decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues excluding latin america was primarily attributable to higher operating income for the year ended december 31, 2018 related to successful execution of the larger transmission project in canada described above and increased revenues from emergency restorations services, which typically yield higher margins due in part to higher equipment utilization and absorption of fixed costs. additionally, operating income for the year ended december 31, 2019 was negatively impacted due to an increase in unabsorbed costs in canada related to permitting and other delays to the commencement of construction for certain larger transmission projects.
pipeline and industrial infrastructure services segment results the increase in revenues was primarily due to approximately $165 million in revenues from acquired businesses. also contributing to the increase were increased revenues from smaller pipeline transmission, gas distribution and industrial services, which resulted from increased capital spending by our customers. partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenues from larger pipeline transmission projects, the timing of which is highly variable due to potential permitting delays, worksite access limitations related to environmental regulations and seasonal weather patterns. also partially offsetting these increases were less favorable foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended december 31, 2019, which negatively impacted revenues by approximately $25 million and were primarily attributable to the relationship between the u.s. dollar and the canadian and australian dollars.
the increases in operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenues were primarily due to improved margins across our transmission, distribution and industrial services operations resulting from improved execution and utilization, including successful execution on a larger gas transmission project that resulted in lower project costs and higher earnings. additionally, operating income and operating income as a percentage of segment revenues in 2018 were negatively impacted by the recognition of $52.7 million of asset impairment and other charges primarily related to the winding down of certain oil-influenced operations and assets, as compared to $10.2 million of asset impairment charges in 2019 primarily related to the winding down and exit of certain additional oil-influenced operations and assets. the year ended december 31, 2018 was also negatively impacted by $17.3 million of project losses associated with production issues and severe weather conditions on a gas transmission project. additionally, the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 were negatively impacted by $28.3 million and $32.5 million of project losses associated with engineering and production delays on a processing facility project, which was substantially complete as of december 31, 2019.
corporate and non-allocated costs the increase in corporate and non-allocated costs was partially due to a $13.4 million increase in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities in the year ended december 31, 2019, as compared to an $11.2 million decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities recognized during the year ended december 31, 2018 based on performance of certain acquired businesses. also contributing to the increase was an $18.1 million increase in intangible amortization due to an increase in intangible assets associated primarily with 2019 acquisitions, an $11.1 million increase in deferred compensation expense primarily associated with increases in the market value of participants' investment elections, a $7.2 million increase in professional fees and a $7.5 million increase in acquisition-related costs. partially offsetting these increases was a $6.8 million decrease in incentive and stock-based compensation, primarily attributable to lower performance against incentive compensation metrics in 2019 as compared to 2018.
remaining performance obligations and backlog a performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a distinct good or service. our remaining performance obligations represent management's estimate of consolidated revenues that are expected to be realized from the remaining portion of firm orders under fixed price contracts not yet completed or for which work has not yet begun, which includes estimated revenues attributable to consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities (vies), revenues from funded and unfunded portions of government contracts to the extent they are reasonably expected to be realized, and revenues from change orders and claims to the extent management believes they will be earned and are probable of collection.
we have also historically disclosed our backlog, a measure commonly used in our industry but not recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states (gaap). we believe this measure enables management to more effectively forecast our future capital needs and results and better identify future operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. we believe this measure is also useful for investors in forecasting our future results and comparing us to our competitors. our remaining performance obligations are a component of backlog, which also includes estimated orders under master service agreements (msas), including estimated renewals, and non-fixed price contracts expected to be completed within one year. our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies.
as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, msas accounted for 53% and 53% of our estimated 12-month backlog and 61% and 60% of total backlog. generally, our customers are not contractually committed to specific volumes of services under our msas, and most of our contracts can be terminated on short notice even if we are not in default. we determine the estimated backlog for these msas using recurring historical trends, factoring in seasonal demand and projected customer needs based upon ongoing communications. in addition, many of our msas are subject to renewal, and these potential renewals are considered in determining estimated backlog. as a result, estimates for remaining performance obligations and backlog are subject to change based on, among other things, project accelerations; project cancellations or delays, including but not limited to those caused by commercial issues, regulatory requirements, natural disasters and adverse weather conditions; and final acceptance of change orders by customers. these factors can cause revenues to be realized in periods and at levels that are different than originally projected.
the following table reconciles total remaining performance obligations to our backlog (a non-gaap measure) by reportable segment, along with estimates of amounts expected to be realized within 12 months (in thousands):

liquidity and capital resources management monitors financial markets and national and global economic conditions for factors that may affect our liquidity and capital resources. we consider our investment policies related to cash and cash equivalents to be conservative in that we maintain a diverse portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality cash and cash equivalent investments with short-term maturities. we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, existing borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facility, our ability to access capital markets and future cash flows from operations will provide sufficient funds to enable us to meet our debt repayment obligations, fund future operating needs, facilitate our ability to pay any future dividends we declare, grow through acquisitions or strategic investments, and fund planned capital expenditures during 2020. however, our liquidity and capital resources, as well as our access to these sources of funds, can be influenced by adverse conditions in financial markets and economic trends and conditions that impact our results of operations.

we also had borrowings of term loans under our senior secured credit facility of $1.24 billion as of december 31, 2019, and we are required to make quarterly principal payments of $16.1 million on these loans.
our industry is capital intensive, and we expect substantial capital expenditures and commitments under equipment lease and rental arrangements to be needed into the foreseeable future in order to meet anticipated demand for our services. total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. we also continue to evaluate opportunities for stock repurchases under our authorized stock repurchase programs.
refer to contractual obligations below for a summary of our future contractual obligations as of december 31, 2019 and off-balance sheet transactions and contingencies below for a description of certain contingent obligations. although some of these contingent obligations could require the use of cash in future periods, they are excluded from the contractual obligations table because we are unable to accurately predict the timing and amount of any such obligations as of december 31, 2019.
sources and uses of cash in summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows (in thousands):
year ended december 31,
2019                    2018
net cash provided by operating activities                    $526,551                  $358,789
net cash used in investing activities                        (617,596     )            (402,670     )
net cash provided by (used in) financing activities           177,687                   (16,570     )
operating activities cash flow from operating activities is primarily influenced by demand for our services and operating margins but is also influenced by working capital needs associated with the various types of services that we provide. our working capital needs may increase when we commence large volumes of work under circumstances where project costs, primarily labor, equipment and subcontractors, are required to be paid before the associated receivables are billed and collected. accordingly, changes within working capital in accounts receivable, contract assets and contract liabilities are normally related and are typically affected on a collective basis by changes in revenue due to the timing and volume of work performed and variability in the timing of customer billings and payments. additionally, working capital needs are generally higher during the summer and fall months due to increased demand for our services when favorable weather conditions exist in many of our operating regions. conversely, working capital assets are typically converted to cash during the winter months. these seasonal trends can be offset by changes in project timing due to delays or accelerations and other economic factors that may affect customer spending.
net cash provided by operating activities during 2019 was favorably impacted by a decrease in cash used for operating assets and liabilities as compared to 2018, including as a result of the timing and number of contracts that include advance billing terms and/or retention balances. net cash used in operating activities during 2019 included our payment of $112 million as a result of the exercise of on-demand advance payment and performance bonds in connection with the termination of the large telecommunications project in peru, which is described in further detail in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
days sales outstanding (dso) represents the average number of days it takes revenues to be converted into cash, which management believes is an important metric for assessing liquidity. a decrease in dso has a favorable impact on cash flow from operating activities, while an increase in dso has a negative impact on cash flow from operating activities. dso is calculated by using the sum of current accounts receivable, net of allowance (which includes retainage and unbilled balances), plus contract assets less contract liabilities, divided by average revenues per day during the quarter. dso as of december 31, 2019 was 81 days, as compared to 74 days as of december 31, 2018. the increase in dso was primarily due to the timing of work on larger pipeline transmission projects and the related billing and collection cycles. during the fourth quarter of 2018, we had higher revenues on larger pipeline transmission projects with relatively lower receivable balances as compared to lower revenues and relatively higher receivable balances on larger pipeline transmission projects during the fourth quarter of 2019.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities during 2019 included $388.0 million used for acquisitions, $261.8 million used for capital expenditures and $47.1 million of cash paid for investments in unconsolidated affiliates and other entities. these items were partially offset by $46.6 million of cash received from investments in unconsolidated affiliates and other entities related to the sale of our equity interest in the limited partnership that built, owned and operated the large electric transmission project in canada and $31.1 million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.
net cash used in investing activities during 2018 included $293.6 million used for capital expenditures; $94.9 million used for acquisitions; $36.9 million of cash paid for investments in unconsolidated affiliates and other entities, including $18.5 million for our acquisition of a 30% interest in a water and gas pipeline infrastructure contractor located in australia and $14.9 million related to the limited partnership for the large electric transmission project in canada; and $14.4 million of cash paid for intangible assets. these items were partially offset by $31.8 million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.

our industry is capital intensive, and we expect substantial capital expenditures and commitments under equipment lease and rental arrangements to be needed into the foreseeable future. we also have various contractual obligations related to investments in unconsolidated affiliates and other capital commitments that are detailed in contractual obligations below. in addition, we expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments, although we cannot predict the timing or amount of the cash needed for these initiatives.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities during 2019 included $272.5 million of net borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. these borrowings were primarily utilized to fund operating and investing activities, including capital expenditures, the cash portion of acquisitions, payments in connection with the exercise of on-demand advance payment and performance bonds described above and working capital requirements. additional financing activities during 2019 included $28.3 million of net short-term debt repayments, $20.1 million of common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program, $23.2 million of cash payments of dividends and cash dividend equivalents and $16.1 million of payments to satisfy tax withholding obligations associated with stock-based compensation.
net cash used in financing activities during 2018 included $443.2 million of common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase programs and $15.2 million of payments to satisfy tax withholding obligations associated with stock-based compensation. these items were mostly offset by $415.3 million of net borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and $33.8 million of net short-term debt borrowings.
contingent consideration liabilities certain of our acquisitions include the potential payment of contingent consideration, payable in the event certain performance objectives are achieved by the acquired businesses during designated post-acquisition periods. the majority of these contingent consideration liabilities are subject to a maximum payment amount, which totaled $157.2 million as of december 31, 2019. included within this maximum amount is approximately $18.0 million related to certain acquisitions completed in 2018, payable based on performance over five-year and three-year post-acquisition periods, and approximately $100.0 million related to the 2017 acquisition of stronghold, ltd. and stronghold specialty, ltd., payable based on performance over a three-year post-acquisition period. the aggregate fair value of all of our contingent consideration liabilities was $84.2 million as of december 31, 2019, of which $77.6 million is included in "accounts payable and accrued expenses" and $6.5 million is included in "insurance and other non-current liabilities." the significant majority of these liabilities would be paid at least 70% to 85% in cash. cash payments for these liabilities up to the amount recognized at the respective acquisition dates, including measurement-period adjustments, will be classified as financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. any cash payments in excess of the amount of contingent consideration liabilities recognized at the respective acquisition dates will be classified as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
stock repurchases we repurchased the following shares of common stock in the open market under our stock repurchase programs (in thousands):
year ended:                   shares             amount december 31, 2019   376                    $11,953

december 31, 2017        1,382             $50,000
our policy is to record a stock repurchase as of the trade date; however, the payment of cash related to a repurchase is made on the settlement date of the trade. during the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, cash payments related to stock repurchases were $20.1 million, $443.2 million and $50.0 million.
as of december 31, 2019, $286.8 million remained authorized under our existing repurchase program, which authorizes us to repurchase outstanding common stock from time to time through june 30, 2021 (the 2018 repurchase program). repurchases under the 2018 repurchase program may be implemented through open market or privately negotiated transactions, at management's discretion, based on market and business conditions, applicable contractual and legal requirements, including restrictions under our senior secured credit facility, and other factors. we are not obligated to acquire any specific amount of common stock and the 2018 repurchase program may be modified or terminated by our board of directors at any time at its sole discretion and without notice. for additional detail about our stock repurchases, refer to note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.

a significant majority of dividends declared were paid on the corresponding payment dates. holders of restricted stock units (rsus) awarded under the quanta services, inc. 2011 omnibus equity incentive plan (the 2011 plan) generally received cash dividend equivalent payments equal to the cash dividend payable on account of the underlying quanta common stock. holders of exchangeable shares of certain canadian subsidiaries of quanta were paid a cash dividend per exchangeable share equal to the cash dividend per share paid to quanta common shareholders on the payment dates. holders of rsus awarded under the quanta services, inc. 2019 omnibus equity incentive plan (the 2019 plan) and holders of unearned and unvested performance stock units (psus) awarded under the 2011 plan and the 2019 plan receive cash dividend equivalent payments only to the extent such rsus and psus become earned and/or vest. additionally, cash dividend equivalents related to certain stock-based awards that have been deferred pursuant to the terms of a deferred compensation plan maintained by us are recorded as liabilities in such plans until the deferred awards are settled.
debt instruments senior secured credit facility we have a credit agreement with various lenders that provides for (i) a $2.14 billion revolving credit facility and (ii) a term loan facility with term loans in the aggregate initial principal amount of $1.29 billion. in addition, subject to the conditions specified in the credit agreement, we have the option to increase the capacity of the credit facility, in the form of an increase in the revolving credit facility, incremental term loans or a combination thereof, from time to time, upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders by up to an additional (i) $400.0 million plus (ii) an additional amount that is unlimited so long as the incremental leverage ratio requirement (as defined in the credit agreement) is satisfied at the time of such increase. the incremental leverage ratio requirement requires, among other things, after giving pro forma effect to such increase and the use of proceeds therefrom, compliance with the credit agreement's financial covenants as of the most recent fiscal quarter end for which financial statements were required to be delivered and that our consolidated leverage ratio (as defined below) does not exceed 2.5 to 1.0, subject to the conditions specified in the credit agreement.
borrowings under the credit agreement are to be used to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. the maturity date for both the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility is october 31, 2022; however, we may voluntarily prepay the term loans from time to time in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. we are required to make quarterly principal payments of $16.1 million on the term loan facility. during the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, our weighted average interest rates associated with our senior secured credit facility were 3.8% and 3.6%.
we borrowed $600.0 million under the term loan facility in october 2018 and borrowed an additional $687.5 million under the term loan facility in september 2019 and used the majority of such proceeds to repay outstanding revolving loans under the credit agreement. as of december 31, 2019, we had $1.35 billion of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement, which included $1.24 billion borrowed under the term loan facility and $104.9 million of outstanding revolving loans. we also had $383.8 million of letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility. the remaining $1.65 billion of available commitments under the revolving credit facility was available for additional revolving loans or letters of credit in u.s. dollars and certain alternative currencies.
the credit agreement contains certain covenants, including (i) a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 (except that in connection with certain permitted acquisitions in excess of $200.0 million, such ratio is 3.5 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter in which the acquisition is completed and the two subsequent fiscal quarters) and (ii) a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0. as of december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the credit agreement. consolidated leverage ratio is the ratio of our consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda (as those terms are defined in the credit agreement). for purposes of calculating our consolidated leverage ratio, consolidated funded indebtedness is reduced by available cash and cash equivalents (as defined in the credit agreement) in excess of $25.0 million. consolidated interest coverage ratio is the ratio of (i) consolidated ebit (as defined in the credit agreement) for the four fiscal quarters most recently ended to (ii) consolidated interest expense (as defined in the credit agreement) for such period (excluding all interest expense attributable to capitalized loan costs and the amount of fees paid in connection with the issuance of letters of credit on our behalf during such period).
the credit agreement provides for customary events of default and generally contains cross-default provisions with other debt instruments exceeding $150.0 million in borrowings or availability. additionally, subject to certain exceptions, (i) all borrowings are secured by substantially all the assets of quanta and its wholly-owned u.s. subsidiaries and by a pledge of all of the capital stock of quanta's wholly-owned u.s. subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of direct foreign subsidiaries of quanta's wholly-owned u.s. subsidiaries and (ii) quanta's wholly-owned u.s. subsidiaries guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the credit agreement. the credit agreement also limits certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, indebtedness, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits liens on our assets. the credit agreement allows cash payments for dividends and stock repurchases subject to compliance with the following requirements (including after giving effect to the dividend or stock repurchase): (i) no default or event of default under the credit agreement; (ii) continued compliance with the financial covenants in the credit agreement; and (iii) at least $100.0 million of availability under the revolving credit facility and/or cash and cash equivalents on hand.

_______________________________________
(1)   we had $1.35 billion of outstanding borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, which included $1.24 billion borrowed under the term loan facility and $104.9 million of outstanding revolving loans, both of which bear interest at variable market rates. assuming the principal amount outstanding at december 31, 2019 remained outstanding and the interest rate in effect at december 31, 2019 remained the same, the annual cash interest expense would be approximately $43.9 million, payable until october 31, 2022, the maturity date of the facility. additionally, in connection with the term loan facility, we are required to make quarterly principal payments of $16.1 million and pay the remaining balance on the maturity date for the facility.
(2)   amount represents cash interest expense on our fixed-rate long-term debt, which excludes our senior secured credit facility.
(3)   amount represents short-term borrowings recorded on our december 31, 2019 consolidated balance sheet.
(4)   amounts represent undiscounted operating lease obligations at december 31, 2019. the operating lease obligations recorded on our december 31, 2019 consolidated balance sheet represent the present value of these amounts.
(5)   amounts represent undiscounted operating leases obligations that had not commenced as of december 31, 2019. the operating leases obligations will be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet beginning on the commencement date of each lease.
(6)   amounts represent undiscounted finance lease obligations at december 31, 2019. the finance lease obligations recorded on our december 31, 2019 consolidated balance sheet represent the present value of these amounts.
(7)   amounts represent short-term lease obligations that are not recorded on our december 31, 2019 consolidated balance sheet due to our accounting policy election. month-to-month rental expense associated primarily with certain equipment rentals is excluded from these amounts because we are unable to accurately predict future rental amounts.
(8)   amount represents capital committed for the expansion of our vehicle fleet. although we have committed to the purchase of these vehicles at the time of their delivery, we expect that these orders will be assigned to third-party leasing companies and made available to us under certain of our master equipment lease agreements.
(9)   amount represents outstanding capital commitments associated with investments in unconsolidated affiliates. as of december 31, 2019, we had outstanding capital commitments associated with investments in unconsolidated affiliates.
as discussed in notes 2, 10, 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, we have various contingencies and commitments that may require the use of cash in future periods. the contractual obligations table excludes the contingencies described below, as we are unable to accurately predict the timing and amount of any of the following contingent obligations.
concentrations of credit risk we are subject to concentrations of credit risk related primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and our net receivable position with customers, which includes amounts related to billed and unbilled accounts receivable and contract assets net of advanced billings with the same customer. substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents are managed by what we believe to be high credit quality financial institutions. in accordance with our investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest cash and cash equivalents in a diversified portfolio of what we believe to be high quality cash and cash equivalent investments, which consist primarily of interest-bearing demand deposits, money market investments and money market mutual funds. although we do not currently believe the principal amount of these cash and cash equivalents is subject to any material risk of loss, changes in economic conditions could impact the interest income we receive from these investments. in addition, we grant credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, to our customers, which include electric power and energy companies, governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the united states, canada, australia and latin america. consequently, we are subject to potential credit risk related to business, economic and financial market conditions that affect these locations. however, we generally have certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. some of our customers have experienced significant financial difficulties (including bankruptcy), and customers may experience financial difficulties in the future. these difficulties expose us to increased risk related to collectability of billed and unbilled receivables and contract assets for services we have performed.
for example, on january 29, 2019, pg&e corporation and its primary operating subsidiary, pacific gas and electric company (collectively pg&e), one of our largest customers, filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the u.s. bankruptcy code, as amended. we are monitoring the bankruptcy proceeding and evaluating the treatment of, and potential claims related to, our pre-petition receivables. as of the bankruptcy filing date, we had $165 million of billed and unbilled receivables. subsequent to the bankruptcy filing, the bankruptcy court approved the assumption by pg&e of certain contracts with our subsidiaries, pursuant to which pg&e had paid $122 million of our pre-petition receivables as of december 31, 2019. we also sold $36 million of our pre-petition receivables to a third party during the three months ended december 31, 2019 in exchange for cash consideration of $34 million, subject to certain claim disallowance provisions, the occurrence of which could result in our obligation to repurchase some or all of the pre-petition receivables sold. we expect the remaining $7 million of pre-petition receivables to be sold or ultimately collected in the bankruptcy proceeding. however, the ultimate outcome of the bankruptcy proceeding is uncertain, and our belief regarding any future sale or collection of the remaining receivables is based on a number of assumptions that are potentially subject to change as the proceeding progresses. should any of these assumptions change, the amount collected could be less than the amount of the remaining receivables. additionally, we are continuing to perform services for pg&e while the bankruptcy case is ongoing and believe that amounts billed for post-petition services will continue to be collected in the ordinary course of business.
no customer represented 10% or more of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017, and no customer represented 10% or more of our consolidated net receivable position at december 31, 2019 or 2018.
legal proceedings we are from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. these actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, negligence or gross negligence and/or property damages, wage and hour claims and other employment-related damages, punitive and consequential damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. with respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record a reserve when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. in addition, we disclose matters for which management believes a material loss is at least reasonably possible. see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding litigation, claims and other legal proceedings.
multiemployer pension plans certain of our operating units are parties to collective bargaining agreements with unions that represent certain of their employees, which require the operating units to pay specified wages, provide certain benefits to union employees and contribute certain amounts to multiemployer pension plans and employee benefit trusts. our multiemployer pension plan contribution rates generally are made to the plans on a "pay-as-you-go" basis based on our union employee payrolls. the location and number of union employees that we employ at any given time and the plans in which they may participate vary depending on our need for union resources in connection with our ongoing projects. therefore, we are unable to accurately predict our union employee payroll and the resulting multiemployer pension plan contribution obligations for future periods.
we may also be required to make additional contributions to our multiemployer pension plans if they become underfunded, and these additional contributions will be determined based on our union employee payrolls. special funding and operational rules are generally applicable to certain of these multiemployer plans that are classified as "endangered," "seriously endangered" or "critical" status based on multiple factors. the amount, if any, that we may be obligated to contribute to these plans cannot be reasonably estimated and is not included in the above table due to uncertainty regarding the amount of future work involving covered union employees, future contribution levels and possible surcharges on plan contributions.
furthermore, we may be subject to additional liabilities imposed by law as a result of our participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans, including in connection with a withdrawal or deemed withdrawal from a plan or a plan being terminated or experiencing a mass withdrawal. these liabilities include an allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits in the plan for all plan participants, not merely the benefits payable to a contributing employer's own retirees. as a result, participating employers may bear a higher proportion of liability for unfunded vested benefits if other participating employers cease to contribute or withdraw, with the reallocation of liability being more acute in cases when a withdrawn employer is insolvent or otherwise fails to pay its withdrawal liability. we are not currently aware of any material withdrawal liabilities that have been incurred or asserted and that remain outstanding. however, we have been subject to significant withdrawal liabilities in the past, including in connection with our withdrawal from the central states, southeast and southwest areas pension plan, and may be subject to material withdrawal liabilities in the future, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
performance bonds and parent guarantees many customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds. these bonds provide a guarantee that we will perform under the terms of a contract and pay our subcontractors and vendors. if we fail to perform, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond, and we must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs. under our underwriting, continuing indemnity and security agreement with our sureties, we have granted security interests in certain of our assets as collateral for our obligations to the sureties. we may be required to post letters of credit or other collateral in favor of the sureties or our customers in the future, which would reduce the borrowing availability under our senior secured credit facility. we have not been required to make any material reimbursements to our sureties for bond-related costs except in connection with the exercise of approximately $112 million of advance payment and performance bonds related to the terminated telecommunications project in peru, which is described further in legal proceedings in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. to the extent further reimbursements are required, the amounts could be material and could adversely affect our consolidated business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. as of december 31, 2019, we are not aware of any outstanding material obligations for payments related to bond obligations.
performance bonds expire at various times ranging from mechanical completion of a project to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances, and as such a determination of maximum potential amounts outstanding requires the use of certain estimates and assumptions. such amounts can also fluctuate from period to period based upon the mix and level of our bonded operating activity. as of december 31, 2019, the total amount of the outstanding performance bonds was estimated to be approximately $2.9 billion. our estimated maximum exposure as it relates to the value of the performance bonds outstanding is lowered on each bonded project as the cost to complete is reduced, and each commitment under a performance bond generally extinguishes concurrently with the expiration of our related contractual obligation. the estimated cost to complete these bonded projects was approximately $1.1 billion as of december 31, 2019.
additionally, from time to time, we guarantee certain obligations and liabilities of our subsidiaries that may arise in connection with, among other things, contracts with customers, equipment lease obligations, joint venture arrangements and contractor licenses. these guarantees may cover all of the subsidiary's unperformed, undischarged and unreleased obligations and liabilities under or in connection with the relevant agreement. for example, with respect to customer contracts, a guarantee may cover a variety of obligations and liabilities arising during the ordinary course of the subsidiary's business or operations, including, among other things, warranty and breach of contract claims, third-party and environmental liabilities arising from the subsidiary's work and for which it is responsible, liquidated damages, or indemnity claims. we are not aware of any claims under any of these guarantees that are material, except as set forth in legal proceedings within note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. to the extent a subsidiary incurs a material obligation or liability and we have guaranteed the performance or payment of such liability, the recovery by a customer or other counterparty or a third party will not be limited to the assets of the subsidiary. as a result, responsibility under a guarantee could adversely affect our consolidated business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
insurance insurance coverage. losses under our insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimate of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. these insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. the accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals are adequate. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, the gross amount accrued for insurance claims totaled $287.6 million and $272.9 million, with $212.9 million and $210.1 million considered to be long-term and included in "insurance and other non-current liabilities." related insurance recoveries/receivables as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 were $35.1 million and $56.5 million, of which $0.3 million and $0.3 million are included in "prepaid expenses and other current assets" and $34.8 million and $56.2 million are included in "other assets, net."
we renew our insurance policies on an annual basis, and therefore deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may change in future periods. in addition, insurers may cancel our coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or we may elect not to obtain certain types or incremental levels of insurance based on the potential benefits considered relative to the cost of such insurance, or coverage may not be available at reasonable and competitive rates. in any such event, our overall risk exposure would increase, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. for example, due to the increased occurrence in recent years and future risk of wildfires in california and other areas in the western united states, australia and other locations, insurers have reduced coverage limits and increased the cost of insurance coverage for those events.
as a result, we expect our level of insurance coverage for wildfire events will decrease at the time of our annual insurance renewal in the spring of 2020, and such level may not be sufficient to cover potential losses. our third party insurers could also decide to further reduce or exclude coverage for wildfires in the future.
project insurance claim. in june 2018, while performing a horizontal directional drill and installing an underground gas pipeline, one of our subsidiaries experienced a partial collapse of a borehole. subsequent to the incident, we worked with our customer to mitigate the impact of the incident and to complete the project. as required by the contract, the customer procured certain insurance coverage for the project, with our subsidiaries as additional insureds, and we worked collaboratively with our customer to pursue insurance claims with the customer's insurance carriers. in december 2019 and january 2020, we reached settlement and release agreements with the insurers and the customer, respectively, resulting in total insurance recoveries related to this matter of $95.5 million. we expect to receive the remaining insurance proceeds in the first quarter of 2020.
hallen acquisition assumed liability. as discussed in further detail in legal proceedings within note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, we assumed certain contingent liabilities in connection with the acquisition of hallen. hallen's liabilities associated with this matter are expected to be covered under applicable insurance policies or contractual remedies negotiated by us with the former owners of hallen. as of december 31, 2019, we had not recorded an accrual for any probable and estimable loss related to this matter. however, the ultimate amount of liability in connection with this matter remains subject to uncertainties associated with pending litigation, including, among other things, the apportionment of liability among the defendants and the likelihood and amount of potential damages claims. as a result, this matter could result in a loss that is in excess of, or not covered by, such insurance or contractual remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
contingent consideration liabilities the liabilities recorded represent the estimated fair values of future amounts payable to the former owners of the acquired businesses and are estimated by management based on entity-specific assumptions that are evaluated on an ongoing basis. because acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities are contingent upon future events, we include these liabilities in the contractual obligations table when the contingencies are resolved. we expect a significant portion of these liabilities to be settled by late 2020 or early 2021.
aggregate fair values of these outstanding and unearned contingent consideration liabilities and their classification in the consolidated balance sheets in item 1. financial statements were as follows (in thousands):
december 31, 2019   december 31, 2018
accounts payable and accrued expenses               $77,618           $-
insurance and other non-current liabilities           6,542           70,756
total contingent consideration liabilities          $84,160           $70,756
the fair values of these liabilities were primarily determined using a monte carlo simulation valuation methodology based on probability-weighted performance projections and other inputs, including a discount rate and an expected volatility factor for each acquisition. the expected volatility factor ranged from 20.4% to 30.0% based on historical asset volatility of selected guideline public companies. depending on contingent consideration payment terms, the present values of the estimated payments are discounted based on a risk-free rate and/or our cost of debt, ranging from 1.6% to 3.9%. the fair value determinations incorporate significant inputs not observable in the market. accordingly, the level of inputs used for these fair value measurements is the lowest level (level 3), as further described in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. significant changes in any of these assumptions could result in a significantly higher or lower potential liability.
the majority of our contingent consideration liabilities are subject to a maximum payment amount, which aggregated to $157.2 million as of december 31, 2019. one contingent consideration liability is not subject to a maximum payout amount, and that liability had a fair value of $1.0 million as of december 31, 2019.
our aggregate contingent consideration liabilities can change due to additional business acquisitions, settlement of outstanding liabilities, changes in the fair value of amounts owed based on performance in post-acquisition periods and accretion in present value. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we recognized a net increase of the fair value of our aggregate contingent consideration liabilities of $13.4 million. during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized net decreases in the fair value of our aggregate contingent consideration liabilities of $11.2 million and $5.2 million. these changes are reflected in "change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities" in our consolidated statements of operations.
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and unrecognized tax benefits we generally do not provide for taxes related to undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because such earnings either would not be taxable when remitted or they are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. we could also be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes if we were to repatriate cash that is indefinitely reinvested outside the united states, but we do not expect such amounts to be material.
quanta and certain subsidiaries remain under examination by various u.s. state, canadian and other foreign tax authorities for multiple periods. we believe it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $6.3 million as a result of settlement of these examinations or the expiration of certain statute of limitations periods.
letters of credit fees and commitment fees the contractual obligations table excludes letters of credit and commitment fees under our senior secured credit facility because the amount of outstanding letters of credit, availability and applicable fees are all variable. assuming that the amount of letters of credit outstanding and the fees as of december 31, 2019 remained the same, the annual cash expense for our letters of credit would be approximately $5.4 million. for additional information regarding our letters of credit and the associated fees and our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, see liquidity and capital resources - debt instruments above.
off-balance sheet transactions as is common in our industry, we have entered into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets. our significant off-balance sheet transactions include certain obligations relating to our investments and joint venture arrangements; short-term, non-cancelable leases; letters of credit obligations; surety guarantees related to performance bonds; committed expenditures for the purchase of equipment; and certain multiemployer pension plan liabilities. see contractual obligations above and note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for a description of these arrangements.
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are published and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented. we review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their publication. judgments and estimates are based on our beliefs and assumptions derived from information available at the time such judgments and estimates are made. uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements. there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. management has reviewed its development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. our accounting policies are primarily described in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data and should be read in conjunction with the following accounting policies identified below that we believe affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
revenue recognition - the estimation of contract revenues and costs, progress on construction projects, variable consideration and collectability of accounts receivables, long-term accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, retainage and contract assets, including amounts related to unapproved change orders in the process of being negotiated;
property and equipment - the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing impairment, useful life determination and the related timing of depreciation and the determination of asset groupings;
goodwill - the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing impairment, including determination of whether to perform a qualitative assessment on some or all of the reporting units, weighting of various methods of determining the fair value of each reporting unit, number of years of cash flows utilized before applying a terminal value, the weighted average cost of capital, transaction multiples, guideline public company multiples and five-year compounded annual growth rates;
other intangible assets - the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing impairment;
income taxes - the identification and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities; the measurement of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets including estimates of future taxable income; estimates associated with tax liabilities in that tax laws and regulations are voluminous and often ambiguous; and benefits from uncertain tax positions (also refer to note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data);
insurance - the estimation of liabilities and related recoveries;
litigation costs and reserves and loss contingencies - the estimation of when a loss is probable or reasonably possible and whether any such loss is reasonably estimable or any range of possible loss is estimable, as well as uncertainties related to the outcome of litigation or other legal proceedings (also refer to notes 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data);
contingent consideration liabilities - the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the fair values of future amounts payable to the former owners of certain acquired businesses; and acquisitions - the assumptions used to determine the fair value of consideration transferred and to allocate this consideration to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions, including the estimated useful lives of other intangible assets subject to amortization (also refer to note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data).

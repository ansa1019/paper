item 1a:      risk factors this "risk factors" section contains references to our "capital stock" and to our "stockholders." unless expressly stated otherwise, the references to our "capital stock" represent our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock, while the references to our "stockholders" represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock.
in order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties.  the acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures.
we face competition in the acquisition and operation of our properties. we expect competition from:
•   businesses;
•   individuals;
•   fiduciary accounts and plans; and
- 20-
•   other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing.
some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase.
negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential tenants, or the industries in which they operate, could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants, re-lease space, collect rent or renew leases, which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth.
cash flow from operations depends in part on our ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms. we could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control, such as:
•   lack of demand in areas where our properties are located;
•   inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants;
•   oversupply of space and changes in market rental rates;
•   declines in our tenants' creditworthiness and ability to pay rent, which may be affected by their operations, economic downturns and competition within their industries from other operators;
•   defaults by and bankruptcies of tenants, failure of tenants to pay rent on a timely basis, or failure of tenants to comply with their contractual obligations;
•   economic or physical decline of the areas where the properties are located; and
•   deterioration of physical condition of our properties.
at any time, any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition. as a result, a tenant may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent, or declare bankruptcy. any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency, leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant's lease and material losses to us.
if tenants do not renew their leases as they expire, we may not be able to rent or sell the properties. furthermore, leases that are renewed, and some new leases for properties that are re-leased, may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms, or may require us to incur significant costs, such as renovations, tenant improvements, or lease transaction costs. negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value, which could result in impairments. any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness. a significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties. in a weakened financial condition, tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them.
further, the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenant's lease or leases. in addition, a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us. if that happens, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases or we may elect not to pursue claims against a tenant for terminated leases. in addition, any claim we have for unpaid past rent, if any, may not be paid in full, or at all. moreover, in the case of a tenant's leases that are not terminated as the result of its bankruptcy, we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions, reducing amounts we receive under those leases. as a result, tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service our indebtedness.
as of december 31, 2019, 94 of our properties were available for lease or sale. as of december 31, 2019, 100 of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants, all of which were current with their rent and other obligations. during 2019, each of our tenants accounted for less than 10% of our rental revenue.
for 2019, our tenants in the "convenience store" industry accounted for approximately 11.9% of our rental revenue. a downturn in this industry could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock.
- 21-
individually, each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10% of our rental revenue for 2019. nevertheless, downturns in these industries could also adversely affect our tenants, which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock, and preferred stock.
in addition, some of our properties are leased to tenants that may have limited financial and other resources, and therefore, they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional, national, or international economy.
as a property owner, we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities.
investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability. an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property. we can face such liability regardless of:
•   our knowledge of the contamination;
•   the timing of the contamination;
•   the cause of the contamination; or
•   the party responsible for the contamination of the property.
there may be environmental conditions associated with our properties of which we are unaware. in that regard, a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleum-based fuels, as well as to operators of oil change and tune-up facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products. these facilities, and some other of our properties, use, or may have used in the past, underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleum-based or waste products, which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances.
the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs or third party liability claims. although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants' activities on the property, we could nevertheless be subject to liability, including strict liability, by virtue of our ownership interest. there also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases. the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial condition, or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness.
in addition, several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and we may acquire other buildings that contain asbestos in the future. environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of asbestos-containing materials, or acms, and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.
it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and/or that, in the future, we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost, or at all. our tenants are generally responsible for, and indemnify us against, liabilities for environmental matters that arise during the lease terms as a result of tenants' activities on the properties. for properties that have underground storage tanks, in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor, the tenants generally are required to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations, including maintaining certain minimum net worth requirements, obtaining environmental insurance, or relying upon the state trust funds where available in the states where these properties are located to reimburse responsible parties for costs of environmental remediation. however, it is possible that one or more of our tenants could fail to have sufficient funds to cover any such indemnification or to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations, and thus we may still be obligated to pay for any such environmental liabilities.
- 22-
compliance.  we have not been notified by any governmental authority, and are not otherwise aware, of any material noncompliance, liability, or claim relating to hazardous substances, toxic substances, or petroleum products in connection with any of our properties. in addition, we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal, state, and local laws relating to acms. nevertheless, if environmental contamination should exist, we could be subject to liability, including strict liability, by virtue of our ownership interest.
insurance and indemnity.  in march 2018, we entered into a ten-year environmental insurance policy that expires in march 2028, which replaced our previous ten-year environmental insurance policy. the limits on our current policy are $10 million per occurrence and $60 million in the aggregate. the limits on the excess policy are $5 million per occurrence and $10 million in the aggregate. therefore, the primary and excess ten-year policies together provide a total limit of $15 million per occurrence and $70 million in the aggregate.
it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that, in the future, we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost, or at all. our tenants are generally responsible for, and indemnify us against, liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties. for properties that have underground storage tanks, in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor, the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located to reimburse tenants for environmental remediation.
if we fail to qualify as a reit, the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities.
we believe that, commencing with our taxable year ended december 31, 1994, we have been organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, so as to qualify as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the code. however, we cannot make any assurances that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit, or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit.
qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions, for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.
for example, in order to qualify as a reit, at least 95% of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains).
if we fail to satisfy any of the requirements for qualification as a reit, we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or, in some circumstances, we may fail to qualify as a reit. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year:
•   we would be required to pay regular united states, or u.s., federal corporate income tax on our taxable income;
•   we would not be allowed a deduction for amounts distributed to our stockholders in computing our taxable income;
•   we could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost;
•   we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders; and
•   this treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities.
even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status, we may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property. for example, if we have net income from a prohibited transaction, that income will be subject to a 100% tax. in addition, our taxable reit subsidiaries, including crest, are subject to federal, state and, in some cases, foreign taxes at the applicable tax rates on their income and property. any failure to comply with legal and regulatory tax obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities.
- 23-
legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us or our investors.
the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue services, or the irs, and the u.s. department of the treasury, or the treasury. changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could adversely affect us or our investors, including holders of our common stock or debt securities. we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect us or our investors. new legislation, treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit.
the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act, or tcja, has significantly changed the u.s. federal income taxation of u.s. businesses and their owners, including reits and their stockholders. we are continuing to assess the potential impact of tcja on us as related regulations are proposed and finalized.
although a number of regulations related to tcja became final in 2018 and 2019, there are still a number of proposed regulations open for comment. the legislation is still unclear in some respects and could be subject to further potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the treasury and irs, any of which could lessen or increase the impact of the legislation. in addition, state and local tax jurisdictions, which often use federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities, are continuing to evaluate the legislation to determine their respective levels of conformity to the new law. while some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis. we continue to work with our tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the recent tax legislation as a whole will have on us.
distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility.
to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, excluding net capital gains, each year. we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including net capital gains) each year.
in addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for that calendar year, 95% of our capital gain net income for the calendar year, and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years.
we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax. differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income, along with the effect of required debt amortization payments, could require us to borrow funds to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit.
future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock.
our future growth will depend, in large part, upon our ability to raise additional capital. if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock. the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to stock incentive plans. likewise, our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series (with dividend, voting and other rights as determined by our board of directors). accordingly, our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting, dividend and other similar rights that could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the interest of holders of our common stock.
we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions, which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell or refinance such assets.
we have in the past and may in the future acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership units in an operating partnership, which could result in stockholder dilution through the issuance of operating partnership units that, under certain circumstances, may be exchanged for shares of our common stock. this acquisition structure may have the effect of, among other things, reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and may require that we agree to restrictions on our ability to dispose of, or refinance the debt on, the acquired properties in order to protect the contributors' ability to defer recognition of taxable gain. similarly, we may be required to incur or
- 24-
maintain debt we would otherwise not incur so we can allocate the debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. these restrictions could limit our ability to sell or refinance an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions.
we are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing.
we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility. the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility also governs our two existing $250.0 million unsecured term loan facilities. at december 31, 2019, we had $704.3 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, a total of $6.32 billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities (excluding unamortized original issuance premiums of $6.3 million and deferred financing costs of $35.9 million), $500.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our two term loan facilities (excluding deferred financing costs of $956,000) and approximately $408.4 million of outstanding mortgage debt (excluding net unamortized premiums totaling $3.0 million and deferred financing costs of $1.3 million on this mortgage debt). our revolving credit facility grants us the option, subject to customary conditions, to expand the borrowing limits thereunder to up to $4.0 billion. we also may in the future enter into amendments and restatements of our current revolving credit facility and term loan facilities, or enter into new revolving credit facilities or term loan facilities, and any such amended, restated or replacement revolving credit facilities or term loan facilities may increase the amounts we are entitled to borrow, subject to customary conditions, compared to our current revolving credit facility and term loan facilities or we may incur other indebtedness. to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. as a result, we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to make required payments on our debt. we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rates on our revolving credit facility, our term loans and some of our mortgage debt are variable and could therefore increase over time. we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due. given past disruptions in the financial markets and the ongoing global financial crisis uncertainties, including the impact of the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union (referred to as brexit), we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our revolving credit facility may not be able to lend us money.
in addition, our revolving credit facility, our term loan facilities and our mortgage loan documents contain provisions that could limit or, in certain cases, prohibit the payment of dividends and other distributions to holders of our common stock and preferred stock. in particular, our revolving credit facility and our two $250.0 million term loan facilities, all of which are governed by the same credit agreement, provide that, if an event of default (as defined in the credit agreement) exists, we may not pay any dividends or make other distributions on (except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or preferred stock, during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of:
•   the sum of (a) 95% of our adjusted funds from operations (as defined in the credit agreement) for that period plus (b) the aggregate amount of cash distributions made to holders of our outstanding preferred stock for that period, and
•   the minimum amount of cash distributions required to be made to our stockholders in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes and to avoid the payment of any income or excise taxes that would otherwise be imposed under specified sections of the code on income we do not distribute to our stockholders, except that we may repurchase or redeem shares of our outstanding preferred stock with the net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock or preferred stock. the credit agreement further provides that, in the event of a failure to pay principal, interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to one or more of our subsidiaries that in the aggregate meet a significance test set forth in the credit agreement, we and our subsidiaries (other than our wholly-owned subsidiaries) may not pay any dividends or make other distributions on (except for (a) distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class and (b) dividends and distributions described in the second bullet point above), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or preferred stock. if any such event of default under the credit agreement were to occur, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities, could limit the amount of dividends or other distributions payable to holders of our common stock and preferred stock or the amount of interest and principal we are able to pay on our indebtedness, or prevent us from paying those dividends, other distributions, interest or principal altogether, and may adversely affect our ability to qualify, or prevent us from qualifying, as a reit.
- 25-
our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common stock, preferred stock, and debt securities, including:
•   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements;
•   requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and general corporate requirements;
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and
•   putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness.
if we default under a debt instrument, the lenders will generally have the right to demand immediate repayment of the principal and interest on all of their loans and, in the case of secured indebtedness, to exercise their rights to seize and sell the collateral. moreover, a default under a single loan or debt instrument may trigger cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in other indebtedness and debt instruments, giving the holders of such other indebtedness and debt instruments similar rights to demand immediate repayment and to seize and sell any collateral.
our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness.
our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness, and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. we cannot make any assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock, to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs.
the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors.
the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time and may be outside of our control, including:
•   prevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and debt securities;
•   the market for similar securities issued by other reits;
•   general economic, political and financial market conditions;
•   the financial condition, performance and prospects of us, our tenants and our competitors;
•   changes in legal and regulatory taxation obligations;
•   litigation and regulatory proceedings;
•   changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us, our competitors or our industry;
•   changes in our credit ratings; and
•   actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors.
in addition, over the last several years, prices of common stock and debt securities in the united states, trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations, and the market values of our common stock and debt securities have also fluctuated significantly during this period. as a result of these and other factors, investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease, which could be substantial and rapid, in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.
real estate ownership is subject to particular conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue.
we are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate. in particular, we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses, debt service payments on indebtedness we incur, and distributions on our capital stock. additional real estate ownership risks include:
•   adverse changes in general or local economic conditions;
•   changes in supply of, or demand for, similar or competing properties;
- 26-
•   changes in interest rates and operating expenses;
•   competition for tenants;
•   changes in market rental rates;
•   inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases;
•   renewal of leases at lower rental rates;
•   inability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship, including bankruptcy;
•   changes in tax, real estate, zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate;
•   uninsured property liability;
•   property damage or casualty losses;
•   unexpected expenditures for capital improvements, including requirements to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws;
•   the need to periodically renovate and repair our properties;
•   development oriented activities;
•   physical or weather-related damage to properties;
•   the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time;
•   acts of terrorism and war; and
•   acts of god and other factors beyond the control of our management.
real estate property investments are illiquid. we may not be able to dispose of properties when desired or on favorable terms.
real estate investments are relatively illiquid. our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited. no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value, at a price and at terms that are acceptable to us, for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons. our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations.
we are engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing, underwriting, and negotiating possible acquisition transactions. we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions. our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms, our failure to adequately underwrite and identify risks and obligations when acquiring properties, or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions.
furthermore, we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding, single-tenant, net lease locations. we may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types and properties leased to tenants engaged in non-retail businesses, including risks resulting from our limited experience in managing, underwriting and assessing risks related to such properties or understanding the market dynamics applicable to such properties, tenants or lease structures, any of which could also have a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations.
we are subject to additional risks from our international investments.
we have acquired and may continue to acquire properties outside of the united states. these investments may expose us to a variety of risks that are different from and in addition to those commonly found in the united states. our international investments are subject to additional risks, including:
•   the laws, rules and regulations applicable in such jurisdictions outside of the united states, including those related to property ownership by foreign entities;
•   complying with a wide variety of foreign laws;
•   fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the u.s. dollar, and exchange controls;
•   limited experience with local business and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices;
•   challenges in establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in different regions and to monitor and ensure compliance with applicable regulations, such as applicable laws related to corrupt practices, employment, licensing, construction or environmental compliance;
- 27-
•   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tax, tariffs, trade barriers and other laws within jurisdictions outside the united states or between the united states and such jurisdictions;
•   potentially adverse tax consequences with respect to our properties;
•   the impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability, including deteriorations in political relations with the united states, instability in, or further withdrawals from, the european union or other international trade alliances or agreements; and
•   political instability, uncertainty over property rights, civil unrest, drug trafficking, political activism or the continuation or escalation of terrorist or gang activities.
if we are unable to adequately address these risks, they could have a significant adverse effect on our operations.
we may engage in development or expansion projects or invest in new assets, which would subject us to additional risks that could negatively impact our operations.
we may engage in development or other expansion projects, which would require us to raise additional capital and oversee state and local permitting. a decision by any governmental agency not to issue a required permit or substantial delays in the permitting process could prevent us from pursuing the development or expansion project. additionally, any such new development or expansion project may not operate at designed capacity or may cost more to operate than we expect. the inability to successfully complete development or expansion projects or to complete them on a timely basis could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
in the future, we may invest in new or different assets that may or may not be closely related to our current business. these new assets may have new, different or increased risks than what we are currently exposed to in our business and we may not be able to manage these risks successfully. additionally, when investing in such new assets, we will be exposed to the risk that those assets, or the income generated thereby, will affect our ability to meet the requirements to maintain our reit status. if we are not able to successfully manage the risks associated with such new assets, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties.
under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties, tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons, air, water, land or property, due to activities conducted on the properties, except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents. additionally, tenants are generally required, at the tenant's expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies. the insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab, foundations, supports and other customarily excluded improvements. our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage depending on the tenant and the industry in which the tenant operates.
in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above, many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies (subject to substantial deductibles) obtained and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs. additionally, we have obtained blanket liability, flood and earthquake (subject to substantial deductibles) and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss. however, should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in, and anticipated revenue from, one or more of the properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. we also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies, and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire.
in addition, although we obtain title insurance policies of our properties to protect us and our properties against unknown title defects (such as claims of ownership, liens or other encumbrances), there may be certain title defects that our title insurance will not cover. if a material title defect related to any of our properties is not adequately covered by a title insurance policy, we could lose some or all of our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property, cause a financial misstatement or damage our reputation.

compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire, safety, and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations.
our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990, or the ada. the ada has separate compliance requirements for "public accommodations" and "commercial facilities," but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the u.s. government or an award of damages to private litigants. the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions, and we believe that these retailers may be generally obligated to cover costs associated with compliance. if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. in addition, we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties. we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.
litigation risks could affect our business.
from time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims. an unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management.
property taxes may increase without notice.
the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. while the majority of our leases are under a net lease structure, some or all of such property taxes may not be collectible from our tenants.
we depend on key personnel.
we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees. the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net lease industry.
natural disasters, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, or other unexpected events may affect the value of our debt and equity securities, the markets in which we operate and our results of operations.
natural disasters, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, or other unexpected events may negatively affect our operations, the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities. there can be no assurance that events like these will not occur or have a direct impact on our tenants, our business or the united states or world generally.
if events like these were to occur, they could materially interrupt our business operations, cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the u.s. and worldwide financial markets and economy. they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the u.s. or abroad. any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities. it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.
our business is subject to risks associated with climate change and our sustainability strategies.
climate change could trigger extreme weather and changes in precipitation, temperature, and air quality, all of which may result in physical damage to, or a decrease in demand for, our properties located in the areas affected by these conditions. should the impact of climate change be severe or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations would be adversely affected.
- 29-
in addition, we seek to promote effective energy efficiency and other sustainability strategies and compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations related to climate change, both internally and with our tenants. our sustainability strategies and efforts to comply with changes in federal, state and international laws and regulations on climate change could result in significant capital expenditures to improve our existing properties or properties we may acquire. any changes to such laws and regulations could also result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures at our properties. if we are unable to comply with laws and regulations on climate change or implement effective sustainability strategies, our reputation among our tenants and investors may be damaged and we may incur fines and/or penalties. moreover, there can be no assurance that any of our sustainability strategies will result in reduced operating costs, higher occupancy or higher rental rates or deter our existing tenants from relocating to properties owned by our competitors.
we rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.
we rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information. although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, our security measures may not be able to prevent the systems' improper functioning, or the theft of intellectual property, personal information, or personal property, such as in the event of cyber-attacks. any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, result in theft of company assets, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock.
historically, there have been periods where the global equity and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of equity and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms, which may adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions. a prolonged downturn in the equity or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. in addition, these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing. these events in the equity and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and debt securities, the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties, as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general.
inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. likewise, even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect the tenants' ability to pay rent.
current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements.
various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements, including estimates related to asset and liability valuations (or potential impairments), and various receivables. often these estimates require the use of market data values that are currently difficult to assess, as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability that can also be difficult to accurately predict. although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates, it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates.
- 30-
inherent limitations of internal controls over financial statements, disclosure controls and safeguarding of assets may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
our internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect financial misstatements or loss of assets because of inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement and disclosure accuracy and safeguarding of assets. any failure of these internal controls could result in decreased investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and disclosures, our reit qualification being jeopardized, impairment in our access to capital, civil litigation or investigations by the nyse, the sec or other regulatory authorities, which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to risks related to recent proposals for reform regarding libor.
certain of our existing debt instruments and other financial arrangements, including our $3.0 billion revolving credit facility and our $250.0 million term loan facilities, provide for borrowings to be made at variable interest rates that use the london interbank offered rate, or libor (or metrics derived from or related to libor), as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate applicable to outstanding borrowings thereunder, and we may incur additional indebtedness or enter into new financial arrangements that use libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate for borrowing thereunder. libor is the subject of recent proposals for reform. in 2017, the united kingdom's financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021. these reforms may cause libor to cease to exist, new methods of calculating libor to be established or the establishment of alternative reference rates. these consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of libor-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us and could also affect interest rates and other financing costs under our debt instruments and other financial arrangements, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders and shareholder advisory firms.
campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company. if we become engaged in a process or proxy contest with an activist stockholder in the future, our business could be adversely affected, as such activities could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our business plan. additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or actual or potential changes to the composition of our board of directors or management team may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business, instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to current or potential sellers of properties, tenants and financing sources, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. if potential or existing sellers of properties, tenants or financing sources choose to delay, defer or reduce transactions with us or transact with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues, then our results of operations could be adversely affected. similarly, we may suffer damage to our reputation (for example, regarding our corporate governance or stockholder relations) or brand by way of actions taken or statements made by outside constituents, including activist investors and shareholder advisory firms, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and preferred stock and the value of our debt securities, resulting in significant loss of value, which could impact our ability to access capital, increase our cost of capital, and decrease our ability to acquire properties on attractive terms.
our charter contains restrictions upon ownership of our common stock.
our charter contains restrictions on ownership and transfer of our common stock intended to, among other purposes, assist us in maintaining our status as a reit for united states federal and/or state income tax purposes. for example, our charter restricts any person from acquiring beneficial or constructive ownership of more than 9.8% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding shares of common stock. these restrictions could have anti-takeover effects and could reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt to acquire control of us, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
the value of certain of our investment in real property may be reduced as the result of the expiration or loss of local tax abatements, tax credit programs, or other governmental incentives.
certain of our investments have the benefit of governmental tax incentives aimed at inducing retail users to relocate to incentivize development in areas and neighborhoods which have not historically seen robust commercial development. the tcja provided for such communities to be designated as qualified opportunity zones, which are
- 31-
eligible for such tax benefits. these incentives typically have specific sunset provisions and may be subject to governmental discretion in the eligibility or award of the applicable incentives. the expiration of these incentive programs or the inability of potential tenants or users to be eligible for or to obtain governmental approval of the incentives, or the inability to remain compliant with such programs, may have an adverse effect on the value of our investment, cash flow and net income, and may result in impairment charges.
item 7:                              management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general realty income, the monthly dividend company®, is an s&p 500 company dedicated to providing stockholders with dependable monthly dividends that increase over time.  the company is structured as a real estate investment trust, or reit, requiring it annually to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income (excluding net capital gains) in the form of dividends to its stockholders. the monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow generated from real estate owned under long-term, net lease agreements with commercial tenants.
realty income was founded in 1969, and listed on the new york stock exchange (nyse: o) in 1994. over the past 51 years, realty income has been acquiring and managing freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under long-term net lease agreements. as of february 2020, the company is a member of the s&p 500 dividend aristocrats® index for having increased its dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years.
at december 31, 2019, we owned a diversified portfolio:
•   of 6,483 properties;
•   with an occupancy rate of 98.6%, or 6,389 properties leased and 94 properties available for lease;
•   leased to 301 different commercial tenants doing business in 50 separate industries;
•   located in 49 u.s. states, puerto rico and the united kingdom (u.k.);
•   with approximately 106.3 million square feet of leasable space;
•   with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant) of approximately 9.2 years; and
•   with an average leasable space per property of approximately 16,393 square feet; approximately 11,800 square feet per retail property and 237,668 square feet per industrial property.
of the 6,483 properties in the portfolio at december 31, 2019, 6,452, or 99.5%, are single-tenant properties, of which 6,362 were leased, and the remaining are multi-tenant properties.
unless otherwise specified, references to rental revenue in the management's discuss and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are exclusive of reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses totaling $69.1 million, $47.0 million and $46.1 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
liquidity and capital resources capital philosophy historically, we have met our long-term capital needs by issuing common stock, preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure; however, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities. we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties. in addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our credit facility or debt securities. however, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us.
our primary cash obligations, for the current year and subsequent years, are included in the "table of obligations," which is presented later in this section. we expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions and development costs, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs and cash distributions to common or preferred stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities, borrowing on our credit facility and periodically through public securities offerings.
conservative capital structure we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure. therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. at december 31, 2019, our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds, term loans, mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were $7.9 billion, or approximately 24.4% of our total market capitalization of $32.5 billion.
- 35-
we define our total market capitalization at december 31, 2019 as the sum of:
•   shares of our common stock outstanding of 333,619,106, plus total common units outstanding of 463,119, multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of $73.63 per share on december 31, 2019, or $24.6 billion;
•   outstanding borrowings of $704.3 million on our credit facility, including £169.2 million sterling;
•   outstanding mortgages payable of $408.4 million, excluding net mortgage premiums of $3.0 million and deferred financing costs of $1.3 million;
•   outstanding borrowings of $500.0 million on our term loans, excluding deferred financing costs of $956,000; and
•   outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of $6.3 billion, excluding unamortized net original issuance premiums of $6.3 million and deferred financing costs of $35.9 million.
universal shelf registration in november 2018, we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec, which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in november 2021. in accordance with sec rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit. the securities covered by this registration statement include (1) common stock, (2) preferred stock, (3) debt securities, (4) depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock, (5) warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares, and (6) any combination of these securities. we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered. the specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.
at-the-market (atm) programs under our atm equity distribution plan, or our atm program, pursuant to which up to 33,402,405 additional shares of common stock may be offered and sold (1) by us to, or through, a consortium of banks acting as our sales agents or (2) by a consortium of banks acting as forward sellers on behalf of any forward purchasers contemplated thereunder, in each case by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the nyse at prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. at december 31, 2019, we had 33,402,405 shares remaining for future issuance under our current atm program. we anticipate maintaining the availability of our atm program in the future, including through replenishing the authorized shares issuable thereunder.

dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, or our drspp, provides our common stockholders, as well as new investors, with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions. our drspp also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions. our drspp authorizes up to 26,000,000 common shares to be issued. our drspp includes a waiver approval process, allowing larger investors or institutions, per a formal approval process, to purchase shares at a small discount, if approved by us. we did not issue shares under the waiver approval process during 2019 or 2018. at december 31, 2019, we had 11,652,668 shares remaining for future issuance under our drspp program.

revolving credit facility in august 2019, we amended and restated our unsecured credit facility, or our credit facility, in order to allow borrowings in multiple currencies. the amended and restated credit facility is otherwise substantively consistent with the prior credit agreement entered into in october 2018. our credit facility consists of a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with an initial term that expires in march 2023 and includes, at our option, two six-month extensions and a $250.0 million unsecured term loan due march 2024. the unsecured revolving credit facility allows us to borrow in up to 14 currencies, including u.s. dollars, and has a $1.0 billion expansion option. under our credit facility, our investment grade credit ratings as of december 31, 2019 provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate, commonly referred to as libor, plus 0.775% with a facility commitment fee of 0.125%, for all-in drawn pricing of 0.90% over libor.
the borrowing rate is subject to an interest rate floor and may change if our investment grade credit ratings change. we also have other interest rate options available to us under our credit facility. our credit facility is unsecured and, accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation.
at december 31, 2019, we had a borrowing capacity of $2.3 billion available on our revolving credit facility and an outstanding balance of $704.3 million, including £169.2 million sterling. the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility during 2019 was 3.1% per annum. we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility. at december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with these covenants. we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other general corporate purposes. any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk.
we generally use our credit facility for the short-term financing of new property acquisitions. thereafter, we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of long-term or permanent financing, which may include the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. we cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing, or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities at acceptable terms. we regularly review our credit facility and may seek to extend, renew or replace our credit facility, to the extent we deem appropriate.
term loans in october 2018, in conjunction with our credit facility, we entered into a $250.0 million senior unsecured term loan, which matures in march 2024. borrowing under this term loan bears interest at the current one-month libor plus 0.85%. in conjunction with this term loan, we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest on this term loan at 3.89%. the terms of this term loan were not impacted by the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement in august 2019.
in june 2015, in conjunction with entering into our previous credit facility, we entered into a $250.0 million senior unsecured term loan maturing june 2020. borrowing under this term loan bears interest at the current one-month libor, plus 0.90%. in conjunction with this term loan, we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 2.62%. the terms of this term loan were not impacted by the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement in august 2019.
in january 2013, in conjunction with our acquisition of american realty capital trust, inc., or arct, we entered into a $70.0 million senior unsecured term loan with an initial maturity date of january 2018. borrowing under this term loan bore interest at the current one-month libor, plus 1.10%. in conjunction with this term loan, we also entered into an interest rate swap, which, until its termination in january 2018, effectively fixed our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 2.05%. in 2018, we entered into two separate six-month extensions of this loan, during which periods the interest was borne at the current one-month libor, plus 0.90%. in january 2019, we paid off the outstanding principal and interest on this term loan.
- 37-
mortgage debt as of december 31, 2019, we had $408.4 million of mortgages payable, all of which were assumed in connection with our property acquisitions. additionally, at december 31, 2019, we had net premiums totaling $3.0 million on these mortgages and deferred financing costs of $1.3 million. we expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties have declined to a level that would make it economically feasible to do so. during 2019, we made $20.7 million of principal payments, including the repayment of one mortgage in full for $15.8 million.
notes outstanding our senior unsecured note and bond obligations consist of the following as of december 31, 2019, sorted by maturity date (dollars in millions):
5.750% notes, issued in june 2010 and due in january 2021        $250

(1) represents the principal balance (in u.s. dollars) of the sterling-denominated private placement of £315.0 million sterling converted at the applicable exchange rate on december 31, 2019.
in may 2019, we issued £315.0 million sterling of 2.730% senior unsecured notes due 2034 through a private placement.
in june 2019, we issued $500.0 million of 3.250% senior unsecured notes due 2029, or the 2029 notes. the public offering price for the 2029 notes was 99.36% of the principal amount, for an effective yield to maturity of 3.326% and net proceeds of approximately $492.2 million.
the net proceeds from these offerings were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, to fund investment opportunities, and for other general corporate purposes.
all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates and contain various covenants, with which we remained in compliance as of december 31, 2019. additionally, interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually.
the following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes, as defined and calculated per the terms of our senior notes and bonds. these calculations, which are not based on u.s. gaap measurements, are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our senior notes and bonds as well as to disclose our current compliance with such covenants, and are not measures of our liquidity or performance. the actual amounts as of december 31, 2019 are:
note covenants                                  required                           actual limitation on incurrence of total debt          &lt; 60% of adjusted assets    39.6   %
limitation on incurrence of secured debt        &lt; 40% of adjusted assets     2.1   %
debt service coverage (trailing 12 months)(1)   &gt; 1.5 x                     5.0x maintenance of total unencumbered assets        &gt; 150% of unsecured debt   256.9   %
(1)  our debt service coverage ratio is calculated on a pro forma basis for the preceding four-quarter period on the assumptions that: (i) the incurrence of any debt (as defined in the covenants) incurred by us since the first day of such four-quarter period and the application of the proceeds therefrom (including to refinance other debt since the first day of such four-quarter period), (ii) the repayment or retirement of any of
- 38-
our debt since the first day of such four-quarter period, and (iii) any acquisition or disposition by us of any asset or group since the first day of such four quarters had in each case occurred on january 1, 2019, and subject to certain additional adjustments.  such pro forma ratio has been prepared on the basis required by that debt service covenant, reflects various estimates and assumptions and is subject to other uncertainties, and therefore does not purport to reflect what our actual debt service coverage ratio would have been had transactions referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence occurred as of january 1, 2019, nor does it purport to reflect our debt service coverage ratio for any future period. the following is our calculation of debt service and fixed charge coverage at december 31, 2019 (in thousands, for trailing twelve months):

authorized shares in may 2019, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of our common stock under our articles of incorporation to 740,200,000 from 370,100,000.
cash reserves we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders, in the form of monthly cash distributions, a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties. we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital. at december 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $54.0 million, inclusive of £30.7 million sterling.
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities, and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months. we intend, however, to use permanent or long-term capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility.
credit agency ratings the borrowing interest rates under our revolving credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. as of december 31, 2019, we were assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds:  moody's investors service has assigned a rating of a3 with a "stable" outlook, standard & poor's ratings group has assigned a rating of a- with a "stable" outlook, and fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb+ with a "stable" outlook.
based on our ratings as of december 31, 2019, the facility interest rate was libor, plus 0.775% with a facility commitment fee of 0.125%, for all-in drawn pricing of 0.90% over libor. our credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between: (i) libor, plus 1.45% if our credit rating is lower than bbb-/baa3 or unrated and (ii) libor, plus 0.75% if our credit rating is a/a2 or higher. in addition, our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which range from: (i) 0.30% for a rating lower than bbb-/baa3 or unrated, and (ii) 0.10% for a credit rating of a/a2 or higher.
we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions. if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease. the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. moreover, a rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.

(1)   none of our investments during 2019 caused any one tenant to be 10% or more of our total assets at december 31, 2019. all of our 2019 investments in acquired properties are 100% leased at the acquisition date.
(2)   represents investments of £625.8 million sterling during the year ended december 31, 2019 converted at the applicable exchange rate on the date of acquisition.
(3)   the tenants occupying the new properties operate in 31 industries, and are 94.6% retail and 5.4% industrial, based on rental revenue. approximately 36% of the rental revenue generated from acquisitions during 2019 is from investment grade rated tenants, their subsidiaries or affiliated companies.
the initial average cash lease yield for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual first year cash net operating income, which, in the case of a net leased property, is equal to the aggregate cash base rent for the first full year of each lease, divided by the total cost of the property. since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent, we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above.
in the case of a property under development or expansion, the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return. when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion, the initial average cash lease yield is computed as follows: estimated cash net operating income (determined by the lease) for the first full year of each lease, divided by our projected total investment in the property, including land, construction and capitalized interest costs. we may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future.
portfolio discussion leasing results at december 31, 2019, we had 94 properties available for lease out of 6,483 properties in our portfolio, which represents a 98.6% occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio.
the following table summarized our leasing results for the year ended december 31, 2019:
properties available for lease at december 31, 2018     80
lease expirations                                      304

properties available for lease at december 31, 2019     94
(1)   the annual new rent on these re-leases was $54.978 million, as compared to the previous annual rent of $53.605 million on the same properties, representing a rent recapture rate of 102.6% on the properties re-leased during the year ended december 31, 2019.
(2)   re-leased to eight new tenants after a period of vacancy, and seven new tenants without vacancy.
as part of our re-leasing costs, we pay leasing commissions to unrelated, third party real estate brokers consistent with the commercial real estate industry standard, and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions. we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations.
- 41-
at december 31, 2019, our average annualized rental revenue was approximately $14.88 per square foot on the 6,389 leased properties in our portfolio. at december 31, 2019, we classified 23 properties with a carrying amount of $96.8 million as held for sale on our balance sheet. the expected sale of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results and is consistent with our existing disposition strategy to further enhance our real estate portfolio and maximize portfolio returns.
investments in existing properties in 2019, we capitalized costs of $17.9 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $2.1 million for re-leasing costs, $801,000 for recurring capital expenditures, and $15.0 million for non-recurring building improvements. in 2018, we capitalized costs of $17.9 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $3.9 million for re-leasing costs, $1.1 million for recurring capital expenditures, and $12.9 million for non-recurring building improvements.
the majority of our building improvements relate to roof repairs, hvac improvements, and parking lot resurfacing and replacements. the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly, depending on the rental market, tenant credit worthiness, the lease term and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases.
we define recurring capital expenditures as mandatory and repetitive landlord capital expenditure obligations that have a limited useful life. we define non-recurring capital expenditures as property improvements where we invest additional capital that extend the useful life of the properties.
increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders we have continued our 51-year policy of paying monthly dividends. in addition, we increased the dividend five times during 2019 and twice in 2020. as of february 2020, we have paid 89 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 105 times since our listing on the nyse in 1994.

the dividends paid per share during 2019 totaled approximately $2.7105, as compared to approximately $2.6305 during 2018, an increase of $0.08, or 3.0%.
the monthly dividend of $0.2325 per share represents a current annualized dividend of $2.79 per share, and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 3.8% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of $73.63 on december 31, 2019. although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends, that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share, or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period.
results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap, and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other
- 42-
factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap, many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies. management must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. when acquiring a property for investment purposes, we typically allocate the cost of real estate acquired, inclusive of transaction costs, to: (1) land, (2) building and improvements, and (3) identified intangible assets and liabilities, based in each case on their relative estimated fair values. intangible assets and liabilities consist of above-market or below-market lease value and the value of in-place leases, as applicable. additionally, above-market rents on certain leases under which we are a lessor are accounted for as financing receivables amortizing over the lease term, while below-market rents on certain leases under which we are a lessor are accounted for as prepaid rent. in an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties. the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value of the land, building and improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities and is often based upon the various characteristics of the market where the property is located. in addition, any assumed mortgages are recorded at their estimated fair values. the estimated fair values of our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable interest rates that have been adjusted for factors, such as industry type, tenant investment grade, maturity date, and comparable borrowings for similar assets. the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses.
another significant judgment must be made as to if, and when, impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. a provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds (undiscounted) are less than the current book value of the property. key inputs that we utilize in this analysis include projected rental rates, estimated holding periods, capital expenditures, and property sales capitalization rates. if a property is held for sale, it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value, less estimated cost to sell. the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheets. our strategy of primarily holding properties, long-term, directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable, thus requiring the recognition of an impairment. however, if our strategy, or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future, an impairment may need to be recognized. if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment, they could have a material impact on our results of operations.

•   the 753 properties (4.8 million square feet) we acquired in 2018, which generated $112.7 million of rent in 2019, compared to $54.0 million in 2018, an increase of $58.7 million; and

•   same store rents generated on 4,811 properties (83.4 million square feet) during 2019 and 2018, increased by $18.0 million, or 1.6%, to $1.176 billion from $1.158 billion; partially offset by
•   a net decrease of $15.7 million relating to properties sold in 2019 and during 2018;
•   a net decrease in straight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments to rent of $3.2 million in 2019 as compared to 2018; and
•   a net decrease of $1.8 million relating to the aggregate of (i) rental revenue from properties (130 properties comprising 3.2 million square feet) that were available for lease during part of 2019 or 2018, (ii) rental revenue for 10 properties under development, and (iii) lease termination settlements. in aggregate, the revenues for these items totaled $24.9 million in 2019, compared to $26.7 million in 2018.
the increase in rental revenue in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily attributable to:
•   the 753 properties (4.8 million square feet) we acquired in 2018, which generated $54.0 million of rent in 2018;
•   the 287 properties (7.2 million square feet) we acquired in 2017, which generated $95.7 million of rent in 2018, compared to $35.8 million in 2017, an increase of $59.9 million;
•   same store rents generated on 4,629 properties (78.1 million square feet) during 2018 and 2017, increased by $9.5 million, or 0.9%, to $1.08 billion from $1.07 billion; and
•   a net increase in straight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments to rent of $5.7 million in 2018 as compared to 2017; partially offset by
•   a net decrease of $13.2 million relating to properties sold in 2018 and during 2017; and
•   a net decrease of $7.5 million relating to the aggregate of (i) rental revenue from properties (123 properties comprising 2.7 million square feet) that were available for lease during part of 2018 or 2017, (ii) rental revenue for five properties under development, and (iii) lease termination settlements. in aggregate, the revenues for these items totaled $15.9 million in 2018, compared to $23.4 million in 2017.
for purposes of determining the same store rent property pool, we include all properties that were owned for the entire year-to-date period, for both the current and prior year, except for properties during the current or prior year that; (i) were vacant at any time, (ii) were under development or redevelopment, or (iii) were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced. each of the exclusions from the same store pool are separately addressed within the applicable sentences above, explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period.
of the 6,483 properties in the portfolio at december 31, 2019, 6,452, or 99.5%, are single-tenant properties and the remaining are multi-tenant properties. of the 6,452 single-tenant properties, 6,362, or 98.6%, were net leased at december 31, 2019. of our 6,362 leased single-tenant properties, 5,456 or 85.8% were under leases that provide for increases in rents through:
•   base rent increases tied to a consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings);
•   percentage rent based on a percentage of the tenants' gross sales;
•   fixed increases; or
•   a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions.
percentage rent, which is included in rental revenue, was $8.0 million in 2019, $5.9 million in 2018, and $6.1 million in 2017. percentage rent in 2019 was less than 1% of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1% of rental revenue in 2020.
our portfolio of real estate, leased primarily to commercial tenants under net leases, continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders. at december 31, 2019, our portfolio of 6,483 properties was 98.6% leased with 94 properties available for lease, as compared to 98.6% leased, with 80 properties available for lease at december 31, 2018. it has been our experience that approximately 1% to 4% of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time; however, it is possible that the number of properties available for lease could exceed these levels in the future.
rental revenue (reimbursable)
a number of our leases provide for contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses. the increase in tenant reimbursements in the years presented is primarily due to the growth of our portfolio from acquisitions.
- 44-
other revenue the increase in other revenue for 2019 was primarily related to interest income recognized on financing receivables for certain leases with above-market terms as compared to 2018, partially offset by lower proceeds from property insurance claims, condemnations and interest income from our investments in united states government money market funds.
the increase in other revenue for 2018 was primarily related to higher proceeds from property insurance claims, condemnations and interest income from our investments in united states government money market funds as compared to 2017.

(1)  general and administrative expenses for 2018 included a one-time severance payment made to our former ceo in october 2018. the total value of cash, stock compensation and professional fees incurred as a result of this severance was $28.3 million; however, the net amount, after incorporating accruals for ceo compensation previous to this severance, was $18,651 and was recorded to general and administrative expense (see our discussion of adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders, or affo, which is not a financial measure under generally accepted accounting principles, which includes a reconciliation of this amount). in order to present a normalized calculation of our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue for 2018, we have excluded this one-time executive severance charge to arrive at a normalized general and administrative amount of $65,497, which was used for our calculation.
(2)  excludes rental revenue (reimbursable).
depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2019 and 2018, which was partially offset by property sales in those same periods. as discussed in the sections entitled "funds from operations available to common stockholders (ffo)" and "adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders (affo)," depreciation and amortization is a non-cash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of ffo and affo.

average interest rates                                                                               3.89   %                3.90   %                3.99   %
the increase in interest expense from 2018 to 2019 is primarily due to the october 2018 issuance of our $250.0 million senior unsecured term loan, the may 2019 issuance of our 2.730% notes due 2034, the june 2019 issuance of our 3.250% notes due 2029, and a loss on our interest rate swaps in 2019. the increase in interest expense from 2017 to 2018 is primarily due to the april 2018 issuance of our 3.875% notes due 2025. this increase was partially offset by the december 2017 early redemption of our 6.75% notes due 2019 and lower outstanding debt balances on mortgages payable as a result of mortgage payoffs in 2018.
at december 31, 2019, the weighted average interest rate on our:
•   credit facility outstanding borrowings of $704.3 million was 2.2%;
•   term loans outstanding of $500.0 million (excluding deferred financing costs of $956,000) was 3.3%;
•   mortgages payable of $408.4 million (excluding net premiums totaling $3.0 million and deferred financing costs of $1.3 million on these mortgages) was 4.9%;
•   notes and bonds payable of $6.3 billion (excluding unamortized net original issuance premiums of $6.3 million and deferred financing costs of $35.9 million) was 3.9%; and
•   combined outstanding notes, bonds, mortgages, term loan and credit facility borrowings of $7.9 billion (excluding all net premiums and deferred financing costs) was 3.8%.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are expenditures related to the operations of our company, including employee-related costs, professional fees, and other general overhead costs associated with running our business. in january 2020, we had 194 employees, as compared to 165 employees in january 2019, and 152 employees in january 2018.
the fluctuation of general and administrative costs in 2019 and 2018 is primarily due to the severance charge of $18.7 million incurred in 2018 and related to our former ceo who departed the company in october 2018. additionally, compensation costs in both years increased due to higher headcount.
property expenses (excluding reimbursable)
property expenses (excluding reimbursable) consist of costs associated with unleased properties, non-net-leased properties and general portfolio expenses. expenses related to unleased properties and non-net-leased properties include, but are not limited to, property taxes, maintenance, insurance, utilities, property inspections and legal fees. general portfolio costs include, but are not limited to, insurance, legal, property inspections, and title search fees. at december 31, 2019, 94 properties were available for lease, as compared to 80 at december 31, 2018 and 83 at december 31, 2017.
- 46-
the increase in property expenses (excluding reimbursable) in 2019 is primarily attributable to higher property taxes and maintenance associated with our expanding portfolio size. the 2018 decrease was primarily attributable to lower bad debt expense.
property expenses (reimbursable)
the increase in property expenses (reimbursable) in both 2019 and 2018 was primarily attributable to the increased portfolio size, which contributed to higher contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses primarily due to our acquisitions in each year.
income taxes income taxes are for city and state income and franchise taxes, and for u.k. income taxes paid by us and our subsidiaries.

foreign currency and derivative gains, net we borrow in the local currencies of the countries in which we invest. foreign currency gains and losses are primarily a result of intercompany debt and certain remeasurement transactions.
loss on extinguishment of debt in december 2017, we completed the early redemption on all $550.0 million of outstanding 6.75% notes due august 2019, plus accrued and unpaid interest. as a result of the early redemption, we recognized a $42.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt.
preferred stock dividends we did not pay any preferred stock dividends in 2019 or 2018. preferred stock dividends totaled $3.9 million in 2017. additionally, in april 2017, we paid a final dividend on our class f preferred stock of $1.7 million, which was recorded to interest expense.
excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed when we issued the irrevocable notice of redemption on our class f preferred stock in march 2017, we incurred a non-cash charge of $13.4 million for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value. the non-cash charge represents the class f preferred stock original issuance cost that was paid in 2012.

net income available to common stockholders in 2018 was impacted by a severance payment made to our former ceo in october 2018. the total value of cash, stock compensation and professional fees incurred as a result of this severance was $28.3 million; however, the net amount, after incorporating accruals for ceo compensation previous to this severance, was $18.7 million, equivalent to $0.06 per share.
net income available to common stockholders in 2017 was impacted by a loss of $42.4 million, or $0.15 per share, loss on extinguishment of debt upon the early redemption on all $550.0 million in principal amount of our outstanding 6.75% notes due august 2019, which were redeemed during december 2017. net income was also impacted by a non-cash charge of $13.4 million, or $0.05 per share, for the redemption of the 6.625% monthly income class f preferred stock that was redeemed in april 2017. this charge is based on the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the 6.625% monthly income class f preferred stock that represents the original issuance cost that we paid in 2012.
the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes impairments, gains from the sale of properties, and foreign currency gains and losses, which can vary from period to period based on the timing and significantly impact net income available to the company and available to common stockholders.

the national association of real estate investment trust (nareit) came to the conclusion that a nareit-defined ebitda metric for real estate companies (i.e., ebitda for real estate, or ebitdare) would provide investors with a consistent measure to help make investment decisions among reits. our definition of "adjusted ebitdare" is generally consistent with the nareit definition, other than our adjustment to remove foreign currency and derivative gains and losses and the one-time executive severance charge, as described below (which is consistent with our previous calculations of "adjusted ebitdare"). we define adjusted ebitdare, a non-gaap financial measure, for the most recent quarter, as earnings (net income) before (i) interest expense, including non-cash loss (gain) on swaps, (ii) income and franchise taxes, (iii) real estate depreciation and amortization, (iv) impairment losses, (v) gain on sales of real estate, (vi) foreign currency and derivative gains, net, and (vii) executive severance charge (as described in the adjusted funds from operations section). our adjusted ebitdare may not be comparable to adjusted ebitdare reported by other companies or as defined by nareit, and other companies may interpret or define adjusted ebitdare differently than we do. management believes adjusted ebitdare to be a meaningful measure of a reit's performance because it is widely followed by industry analysts, lenders and investors. management also believes the use of an annualized quarterly adjusted ebitdare metric is meaningful because it represents the company's current earnings run rate for the period presented. the ratio of our total debt to our annualized quarterly adjusted ebitdare is also used to determine vesting of performance share awards granted to our executive officers. adjusted ebitdare should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating performance. our ratio of net debt-to-adjusted ebitdare, which is used by management as a measure of leverage, is calculated as net debt (which we define as total debt per the consolidated balance sheet, less cash and cash equivalents) divided by annualized quarterly adjusted ebitdare.

(1) all per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis.
our ffo in 2018 was impacted by a severance payment made to our former ceo in october 2018. the total value of cash, stock compensation and professional fees incurred as a result of this severance was $28.3 million; however, the net amount, after incorporating accruals for ceo compensation previous to this severance, was $18.7 million, equivalent to $0.06 per share.
our ffo in 2017 was impacted by a loss of $42.4 million, or $0.15 per share, on extinguishment of debt upon the early redemption on all $550.0 million of our outstanding 6.75% notes due august 2019 during december 2017. ffo in 2017 was also impacted by a non-cash redemption charge of $13.4 million, or $0.05 per share, upon the redemption of the 6.625% monthly income class f preferred stock that was redeemed in april 2017. this charge is based on the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the 6.625% monthly income class f preferred stock that represents the original issuance cost that we paid in 2012.

we define ffo, a non-gaap measure, consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust's definition, as net income available to common stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, plus impairments of depreciable real estate assets, and reduced by gains on property sales.
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit's operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for ffo. the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a reit, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative. the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure. in addition, ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility.

we believe the non-gaap financial measure affo provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies. in particular, affo provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different reits without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to measuring a particular company's on-going operating performance. therefore, we believe that affo is an appropriate supplemental performance metric, and that the most appropriate gaap performance metric to which affo should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders.
presentation of the information regarding ffo and affo is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits, although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo and affo in the same way, so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful. furthermore, ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance. ffo and affo should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. in addition, ffo and affo should not be considered as measures of liquidity, our ability to make cash distributions, or our ability to pay interest payments.
impact of inflation tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants' sales volumes, increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), or fixed increases. we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time. during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in the leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation.
moreover, our use of net lease agreements tends to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation because the tenant is responsible for property expenses. inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue.

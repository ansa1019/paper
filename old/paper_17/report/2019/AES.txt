item 1a. risk factors you should consider carefully the following risks, along with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this form 10-k. additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations, including those discussed in item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form 10-k. if any of the following events actually occur, our business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
we routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate. the categories of risk we have identified in item 1a.-risk factors of this form 10-k include the following:
•   risks associated with our operations;
•   risks associated with governmental regulation and laws; and
•   risks related to our indebtedness and financial condition.
these risk factors should be read in conjunction with item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.
risks associated with our operations the operation of power generation, distribution and transmission facilities involves significant risks.
we are in the business of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operating performance, including:
•   changes in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages, equipment failure, failure of transmission systems, labor disputes, disruptions in fuel supply, poor hydrologic and wind conditions, inability to comply with regulatory or permit
| 2019 annual report requirements, or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, dam failures, tsunamis, explosions, terrorist acts, cyber attacks or other similar occurrences; and
•   changes in our operating cost structure, including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to gas, coal, oil and other fuel; fuel transportation; purchased electricity; operations, maintenance and repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and capital expenditures to install environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance.
our businesses require reliable transportation sources (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports and rail), power sources and water sources to access and conduct operations. the availability and cost of this infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of production and sales. limitations, or interruptions in this infrastructure or at the facilities of our subsidiaries, including as a result of third parties intentionally or unintentionally disrupting this infrastructure or the facilities of our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce electricity. this could have a material adverse effect on our businesses' results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
in addition, a portion of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago. older generating equipment may require significant capital expenditures for maintenance. the equipment at our plants, whether old or new, is also likely to require periodic upgrading, improvement or repair, and replacement equipment or parts may be difficult to obtain in circumstances where we rely on a single supplier or a small number of suppliers. the inability to obtain replacement equipment or parts may impact the ability of our plants to perform and could, therefore, have a material impact on our business and results of operations. breakdown or failure of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of a power purchase or other agreement or incurrence of a liability for liquidated damages and/or other penalties.
power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. in addition to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes and wind, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or actions of third parties or other external events. the control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans and specific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate, the possibility of the occurrence and impact of these risks.
the hazards described above, along with other safety hazards associated with our operations, can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. the occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and/or penalties.
we do a significant amount of business outside the united states, including in developing countries, which presents significant risks.
a significant amount of our revenue is generated outside the united states and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in developing countries. part of our growth strategy is to expand our business in certain developing countries in which aes has an existing presence. we believe these countries may have higher growth rates and offer greater opportunities, with potentially higher returns than in some more developed countries. international operations, particularly the operation, financing and development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:
•   economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region;
•   adverse changes in currency exchange rates;
•   government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;
•   unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary, fiscal or environmental policies;
•   high inflation and monetary fluctuations;
•   restrictions on imports of solar panels, wind turbines, coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate;
•   threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;
| 2019 annual report
•   unexpected delays in permitting and governmental approvals;
•   unexpected changes or instability affecting our strategic partners in developing countries;
•   risks relating to the failure to comply with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, uk bribery act or other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations, including, among other things, cost and disruption in responding to allegations or investigations (regardless of ultimate finding), civil and/or criminal fines, criminal prosecution of individuals, revocation or suspension of permits and/or licenses, civil litigation, reputational damage, loss in share price, and loss of business;
•   unwillingness of governments and their agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their contracts;
•   unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to subsidiaries of the company and less beneficial to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private parties;
•   inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems;
•   adverse changes in government tax policy;
•   potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions; and
•   difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local jurisdictions.
any of these factors, by itself or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
our operations may experience volatility in revenues and operating margin caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability and currency devaluations. this volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses.
our businesses may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be exposed to price volatility as a result of risks associated with the wholesale electricity markets.
some of our businesses sell or buy electricity in the spot markets when they operate at levels that differ from their power sales agreements or retail load obligations or when they do not have any powers sales agreements. our businesses may also buy electricity in the wholesale spot markets. as a result, we are exposed to the risks of rising and falling prices in those markets. the open market wholesale prices for electricity can be volatile and generally reflect the variable cost of the source generation which could include renewable sources at near zero pricing or thermal sources subject to fluctuating cost of fuels such as coal, natural gas or oil derivative fuels in addition to other factors described below. consequently, any changes in the generation supply stack and cost of coal, natural gas, or oil derivative fuels may impact the open market wholesale price of electricity.
volatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from, among other things:
•   plant availability in the markets generally;
•   availability and effectiveness of transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties;
•   competition;
•   seasonality;
•   hydrology and other weather conditions;
•   illiquid markets;
•   transmission, transportation constraints, inefficiencies and/or availability;
•   renewables source contribution to the supply stack;
•   new entrants;
•   increased adoption of distributed generation;
•   energy efficiency and demand side resources;
•   available supplies of coal, natural gas, and crude oil and refined products;
•   generating unit performance;
•   natural disasters, terrorism, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events;
•   energy, market and environmental regulation, legislation and policies;
| 2019 annual report
•   general economic conditions globally as well as in areas where we operate that impact demand and energy consumption; and
•   bidding behavior and market bidding rules.
wholesale power prices are declining in many markets and this could have a material adverse effect on our operations and opportunities for future growth.
the wholesale prices offered for electricity have declined significantly in recent years in many markets in which the company has businesses. this price decline is due to a variety of factors, including the increased penetration of renewable generation resources, low-priced natural gas and demand side management. the levelized cost of electricity from new solar and wind generation sources has dropped substantially in recent years as solar panel costs and wind turbine costs have declined, while wind and solar capacity factors have increased. these renewable resources have no fuel costs and very low operational costs. in many instances, energy from these facilities are bid into the wholesale spot market at a price of zero or close to zero during certain times of the day, driving down the clearing price for all generators selling power in the relevant spot market. also, in many markets, new ppas have been awarded for renewable generation at prices significantly lower than the prices being awarded just a few years ago.
this trend of declining wholesale prices could continue and could have a material adverse impact on the financial performance of our existing generation assets to the extent they currently sell power into the spot market or will seek to sell power into the spot market once their ppas expire. the trend of declining prices can also make it more difficult for us to obtain attractive prices under new long-term ppas for any new generation facilities we may seek to develop. as a result, the trend can have an adverse impact on our opportunities for new investments.
adverse economic developments in china could have a negative impact on demand for electricity in many of our markets.
the chinese market has been driving global materials demand and pricing for commodities over the past decade. many of these commodities are produced in areas that are also our key markets for the sale of electricity. after experiencing rapid growth for more than a decade, china's economy has experienced decreasing foreign and domestic demand, weak investment, factory overcapacity and oversupply in the property market, and has experienced a significant slowdown in recent years. u.s. tariffs are also expected to have a negative impact on china's economic growth. in addition, the outbreak of the coronavirus is a rapidly developing situation in china that has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions in china. in particular, efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus have led to shutdowns of manufacturing facilities and disrupted supply chains. the extent of such impact is unknown at this time. continued slowing in china's economic growth, demand for commodities and/or material changes in policy could result in lower economic growth and lower demand for electricity in our key markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
| 2019 annual report we may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage for liabilities.
power generation, distribution and transmission involves hazardous activities. we may become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage. furthermore, through agic, aes' captive insurance company, we take certain insurance risk on our businesses. we maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our operations. adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not always obtainable. in particular, the availability of insurance for coal-fired generation assets has decreased as certain insurers have opted to discontinue or limit offering insurance for such assets. certain insurers have also withdrawn from insuring hydroelectric assets following significant losses in that business class. for these reasons, as well as the cyclical nature of the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available in the amounts or on terms similar to those presently available to us. in addition, insurance may not fully cover the liability or the consequences of any business interruptions such as natural catastrophes, equipment failure or labor dispute. the occurrence of a significant adverse event not fully or partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results or operations, financial condition, and prospects.
we may not be able to enter into long-term contracts that reduce volatility in our results of operations.
many of our generation plants conduct business under long-term sales and supply contracts, which helps these businesses to manage risks by reducing the volatility associated with power and input costs and providing a stable revenue and cost structure. in these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant plant's output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract. the remaining terms of the power sales contracts of our generation plants range from one to more than 20 years. in many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering into long-term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. in these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are dependent on the continued ability of customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. some of our long-term power sales agreements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long-term fuel supply contracts are at prices below current market prices. the loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder, could adversely impact our strategy by resulting in costs that exceed revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, depending on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long-term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. the inability to enter into long-term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at market prices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable.
we have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long-term contracts in part by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or other customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from certain sovereign governments of the customer's obligations. however, many of our customers do not have, or have failed to maintain, an investment-grade credit rating, and our generation business cannot always obtain government guarantees and if they do, the government does not always have an investment grade credit rating. we have also sought to reduce our credit risk by locating our plants in different geographic areas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns; however, there can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate this risk will be successful.
competition is increasing and could adversely affect us.
the power production markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may have extensive and diversified developmental or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to, or greater than, ours. further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect to both obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets. in certain markets, these factors have caused reductions in prices contained in new power sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices. the evolution of competitive electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas-fired power plants and renewables such as wind and solar have also caused, and could continue to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or
| 2019 annual report intend to sell power. in addition, the introduction of low-cost disruptive technologies or the entry of non-traditional competitors into our sector and markets could adversely affect our ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and financial condition.
supplier and/or customer concentration may expose the company to significant financial credit or performance risks.
we often rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and other services required for the operation of some of our facilities. if these suppliers cannot perform, we would seek to meet our fuel requirements by purchasing fuel at market prices, exposing us to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price, which could adversely impact the profitability of the affected business and our results of operations, and could result in a breach of agreements with other counterparties, including, without limitation, offtakers or lenders. further, our suppliers may source certain materials from china or other areas impacted by coronavirus, which may cause delays and/or disruptions to our development projects or operations.
at times, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations, due to bankruptcy, insolvency, financial distress or other factors. furthermore, in the event of a bankruptcy or similar insolvency-type proceeding, our counterparty can seek to reject our existing ppa under the u.s. bankruptcy code or similar bankruptcy laws, including those in puerto rico. we may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements, or at all. if we were unable to enter into replacement ppas, these businesses may have to sell power at market prices. a breach by a counterparty of a ppa or other agreement could also result in the breach of other agreements, including, without limitation, the debt documents of the affected business.
the financial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers. any failure of a supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations to the aes corporation or our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
our businesses will need to continue to adapt to technological change and we may incur significant expenditures to adapt to these changes.
emerging technologies may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, investments and infrastructure, and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive, or may result in the obsolescence of certain of our operating assets. our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes, to offer services and products that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards.
technological changes that could impact our businesses include:
•   technologies that change the utilization of electric generation, transmission and distribution assets, including the expanded cost-effective utilization of distributed generation (e.g., rooftop solar and community solar projects), and energy storage technology;
•   advances in distributed and local power generation and energy storage that reduce the demand for large-scale renewable electricity generation and/or impact our customers' ability to perform under long-term agreements; and
•   more cost-effective batteries for energy storage, advances in solar or wind technology, and advances in alternative fuels and other alternative energy sources.
emerging technologies may also allow new competitors to more effectively compete in our markets or disintermediate the services we provide our customers, including traditional utility and centralized generation services. if we incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological changes, fail to adapt to significant technological changes, fail to obtain access to important new technologies, fail to recover a significant portion of any remaining investment in obsolete assets, or if implemented technology fails to operate as intended, our businesses, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
| 2019 annual report cyber-attacks and data security breaches could harm our business.
our business is heavily reliant on electronic systems and network technologies to operate our generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure. we also use various financial, accounting and other infrastructure systems. our infrastructure may be targeted by nation states, hacktivists, criminals, insiders or terrorist groups. such an attack, by hacking, malware or other means, may interrupt our operations, cause property damage, affect our ability to control our infrastructure assets, cause the release of sensitive customer information or limit communications with third parties. any loss or corruption of confidential or proprietary data through such breach may:
•   impact our operations and strategic objectives;
•   impact our customer and vendor relationships;
•   result in substantial revenue loss;
•   expose us to legal claims and/or regulatory investigations and proceedings;
•   require extensive repair and restoration costs for additional security measures to avert future cyber-attacks; and
•   impair our reputation and limit our competitiveness for future opportunities.
in addition, a breach of our financial and accounting systems could impact our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information.
we have implemented measures to help prevent unauthorized access to our systems and facilities, including certain measures to comply with mandatory regulatory reliability standards. to date, cyber-attacks have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results. we continue to assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments to address them, including global monitoring of networks and systems, identifying and implementing new technology, improving user awareness through employee security training, and updating our security policies as well as those for third-party providers.
we cannot guarantee the extent to which our security measures will prevent future cyber-attacks and security breaches or that our insurance coverage will adequately cover any losses we may experience. furthermore, we do not control certain of joint ventures or our equity method investments and cannot guarantee that their efforts will be successful.
certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and hydrology.
our businesses are affected by variations in general weather patterns and unusually severe weather. our businesses forecast electric sales based on best available information and expectations for weather, which represents a long-term historical average. while we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns and potential impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter and summer. typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. significant variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations.
changes in weather can also affect the production of electricity at power generation facilities, including, but not limited to, our wind and solar facilities. for example, the level of wind resource affects the revenue produced by wind generation facilities. because the levels of wind and solar resources are variable and difficult to predict, our results of operations for individual wind and solar facilities specifically, and our results of operations generally, may vary significantly from period to period, depending on the level of available resources. to the extent that resources are not available at planned levels, the financial results from these facilities may be less than expected. in addition, we are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which our hydroelectric generation facilities are located. changes in temperature, precipitation and snow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation.
to the extent that hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions negatively affect our hydroelectric generation business, such as has happened in panama in 2019, our results of operations can be materially adversely affected. additionally, our contracts in certain markets where hydroelectric facilities are prevalent may require us to purchase power in the spot markets when our facilities are unable to operate (or operate at lower than anticipated levels) and the price of such spot power may increase substantially in times of low hydrology.
| 2019 annual report severe weather and natural disasters may present significant risks to our business.
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and other fuels and affect the price of energy and energy-related commodities. in addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, icing events, earthquakes, dam failures and tsunamis can be destructive and could prevent us from operating our business in the normal course by causing power outages and property damage, reducing revenue, affecting the availability of fuel and water, causing injuries and loss of life, and requiring us to incur additional costs, for example, to restore service and repair damaged facilities, to obtain replacement power and to access available financing sources. our power plants could be placed at greater risk of damage should changes in the global climate produce unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, including heatwaves, fewer cold temperature extremes, abnormal levels of precipitation resulting in river and coastal urban floods in north america or reduced water availability and increased flooding across central and south america, and changes in coast lines due to sea level change.
depending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected, any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires; releases of natural gas, natural gas odorant, or other greenhouse gases; explosions, spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties; personal injuries, health impacts or fatalities; or present a nuisance to impacted communities. such incidents that do not directly affect our facilities may impact our business partners, supply chains and transportation, which could negatively impact construction projects and our ability to provide electricity and natural gas to our customers.
a disruption or failure of electric generation, transmission or distribution systems or natural gas production, transmission, storage or distribution systems in the event of a hurricane, tornado or other severe weather event, or otherwise, could prevent us from operating our business in the normal course and could result in any of the adverse consequences described above. at our businesses where cost recovery is available, recovery of costs to restore service and repair damaged facilities is or may be subject to regulatory approval, and any determination by the regulator not to permit timely and full recovery of the costs incurred.
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects.
our development projects are subject to substantial uncertainties.
certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates are in various stages of developing and constructing power plants. some but not all of these power plant projects have signed long-term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. successful completion of the development of these projects depends upon overcoming substantial risks, including, but not limited to, risks relating to siting, financing, engineering and construction, permitting, governmental approvals, commissioning delays, or the potential for termination of the power sales contract as a result of a failure to meet certain milestones. for additional information regarding our projects under construction see item 1.-business-our organization and segments included in this form 10-k.
in certain cases, our subsidiaries may enter into obligations in the development process even though the subsidiaries have not yet secured financing, power purchase arrangements, or other important elements for a successful project. for example, our subsidiaries may instruct contractors to begin the construction process or seek to procure equipment even where they do not have financing, a ppa or critical permits in place (or conversely, to enter into a ppa, procurement agreement or other agreement without financing in place). if the project does not proceed, our subsidiaries may remain obligated for certain liabilities even though the project will not proceed. development is inherently uncertain and we may forgo certain development opportunities and we may undertake significant development costs before determining that we will not proceed with a particular project. we believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any individual project will be completed and reach commercial operation. if these development efforts are not successful, we may abandon a project under development and write off the costs incurred in connection with such project. at the time of abandonment, we would expense all capitalized development costs incurred in connection therewith and could incur additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities.
| 2019 annual report we do not control certain aspects of our joint ventures or our equity method investments.
we have invested in some joint ventures in which our subsidiaries share operational, management, investment and/or other control rights with our joint venture partners. in many cases, we may exert influence over the joint venture pursuant to a management contract, by holding positions on the board of the joint venture company or on management committees and/or through certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. however, we do not always have this type of influence over the project or business in every instance and we may be dependent on our joint venture partners or the management team of the joint venture to operate, manage, invest or otherwise control such projects or businesses. our joint venture partners or the management team of our joint ventures may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally, and they may not share our business priorities. in some joint venture agreements in which we do have majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into shareholder agreements granting minority rights to the other shareholders.
the approval of joint venture partners also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from jointly owned entities or to transfer our interest in projects or businesses. the control or influence exerted by our joint venture partners may result in operational management and/or investment decisions that are different from the decisions our subsidiaries would make if they operated independently and could impact the profitability and value of these joint ventures. in addition, in the event that a joint venture partner becomes insolvent or bankrupt or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations to the joint venture or its share of liabilities at the joint venture, we may be subject to joint and several liability for these joint ventures, which means that we may be responsible for meeting certain obligations of the joint ventures, should our joint venture partner be unable to do so, if and to the extent provided for in our governing documents or applicable law.
in addition, we are generally dependent on the management team of our equity method investments to operate and control such projects or businesses. while we may exert influence pursuant to having positions on the boards of such investments and/or through certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions, we do not always have this type of influence in every instance and the scope and impact of such influence may be limited. the management teams of our equity method investments may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally, and they may not share our business priorities, which could have a material adverse effect on value of such investments as well as our growth, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties, including development, operational, and regulatory challenges.
wind, solar, and energy storage projects are subject to substantial risks. some of these business lines are dependent upon favorable regulatory incentives to support continued investment, and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which such favorable regulatory incentives will be available in the future.
furthermore, production levels for our wind and solar projects may be dependent upon adequate wind or sunlight resulting in volatility in production levels and profitability. for example, for our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when available and on wind resource studies conducted by an independent engineer. these wind resource estimates are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any given year, but long-term averages of a resource.
as a result, these types of renewable energy projects face considerable risk, including the risk that favorable regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. in addition, because certain of these projects depend on technology outside of our expertise in generation and utility businesses, there are risks associated with our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably. furthermore, at the development or acquisition stage, because of our more limited experience with the relevant technologies, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted. there are also risks associated with the fact that some of these projects exist in markets where long-term fixed-price contracts for the major cost and revenue components may be unavailable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. these projects can be capital-intensive and generally are designed with a view to obtaining third-party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. as a result, these capital constraints may reduce our ability to develop these projects or obtain third-party financing for these projects.
| 2019 annual report government incentives and policies that support the development of renewable energy generation projects could change at any time.
aes' u.s. renewable energy generation growth strategy depends in part on federal, state and local government policies and incentives that support the development, financing, ownership and operation of renewable energy generation projects. these policies and incentives include investment tax credits, production tax credits, accelerated depreciation, renewable portfolio standards, feed-in-tariffs and similar programs, renewable energy credit mechanisms, and tax exemptions. if these policies and incentives are changed or eliminated, or aes is unable to use them, it could result in a material adverse impact on aes' u.s. renewable growth opportunities, including fewer future ppas or lower prices for the sale of power in future ppas, decreased revenues, reduced economic returns on certain project company investments, increased financing costs, and/or difficulty obtaining financing.
our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations.
our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. while the consolidated financial statements are reported in u.s. dollars, the financial statements of several of our subsidiaries outside the united states are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into u.s. dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. as a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar relative to the local currencies where our subsidiaries outside the united states report could cause significant fluctuations in our results. in addition, while our expenses with respect to foreign operations are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, we have transaction exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary's functional currency. moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations. our financial position and results of operations could be affected by fluctuations in the value of a number of currencies.
we may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates.
we routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity, fuel requirements and other commodities to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. as part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed price or indexed forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. we also enter into contracts which help us manage our interest rate exposure. however, we may not cover the entire exposure of our assets or positions to market price or interest rate volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. furthermore, the risk management practices we have in place may not always perform as planned. in particular, if prices of commodities or interest rates significantly deviate from historical prices or interest rates or if the price or interest rate volatility or distribution of these changes deviates from historical norms, our risk management practices may not protect us from significant losses. as a result, fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates may negatively impact our financial results to the extent we have unhedged or inadequately hedged positions. in addition, certain types of economic hedging activities may not qualify for hedge accounting under u.s. gaap, resulting in increased volatility in our net income. the company may also suffer losses associated with "basis risk," which is the difference in performance between the hedge instrument and the underlying exposure (usually the pricing node of the generation facility). furthermore, there is a risk that the current counterparties to these arrangements may fail or are unable to perform part or all of their obligations under these arrangements, while we seek to protect against that by utilizing strong credit requirements and exchange trades, these protections may not fully cover the exposure in the event of a counterparty default.
for our businesses with ppa pricing that does not completely pass through our fuel costs, the businesses attempt to manage the exposure through flexible fuel purchasing and timing of entry and terms of our fuel supply agreements; however, these risk management efforts may not be successful and the resulting commodity exposure could have a material impact on these businesses and/or our results of operations.
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.
our operating success and ability to carry out growth initiatives depends, in part, on our ability to retain
| 2019 annual report executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel who have experience in our industry and in operating a company of our size and complexity, including people in our foreign businesses. the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements.
our utilities businesses may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers or in customer usage.
customer growth and customer usage in our utilities businesses are affected by a number of factors outside our control, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand side management requirements, and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. a lack of growth, or a decline, in the number of customers or in customer demand for electricity may cause us to fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits from significant investments and expenditures and could have a material adverse effect on our growth, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significant contributions.
we have 28 defined benefit plans, five at u.s. subsidiaries and the remaining plans at foreign subsidiaries, which cover substantially all of the employees at these subsidiaries. pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. any of these assumptions could prove to be incorrect, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. we periodically evaluate the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. our exposure to market volatility is mitigated to some extent due to the fact that the asset allocations in our largest plans include a significant weighting of investments in fixed income securities that are generally less volatile than investments in equity securities. future downturns in the debt and/or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries' pension plan obligations, could result in an increase in pension expense and future funding requirements, which may be material. our subsidiaries that participate in these plans are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdictions for any shortfall of pension plan assets as compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. satisfying such funding requirements may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect the parent company and our subsidiaries' liquidity. for additional information regarding the funding position of the company's pension plans, see item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-critical accounting policies and estimates-pension and other postretirement plans and note 15.-benefit plans included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data included in this form 10-k.
impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.
as of december 31, 2019, the company had approximately $1.1 billion of goodwill, which represented approximately 3% of the total assets on its consolidated balance sheets. goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. we may be required to evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill outside of the required annual evaluation process if we experience situations, including but not limited to: deterioration in general economic conditions, or our operating or regulatory environment; increased competitive environment; lower forecasted revenue; increase in fuel costs, particularly when we are unable to pass through the impact to customers; increase in environmental compliance costs; negative or declining cash flows; loss of a key contract or customer, particularly when we are unable to replace it on equally favorable terms; developments in our strategy; divestiture of a significant component of our business; or adverse actions or assessments by a regulator. for example, during the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of october 1, 2019, the company determined that the fair value of its gener reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 3%. therefore, gener's $868 million goodwill balance was considered to be "at risk" for impairment as of december 31, 2019, largely due to the chilean government's announcement to phase out coal generation by 2040, and a decline in long-term energy prices. see item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-key trends and uncertainties-impairments. these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment, which could substantially affect our results of
| 2019 annual report operations for those periods. additionally, goodwill may be impaired if our acquisitions do not perform as expected. see the risk factor our acquisitions may not perform as expected for further discussion.
long-lived assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives. long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment only when impairment indicators, similar to those described above for goodwill, are present, whereas goodwill is also evaluated for impairment on an annual basis.
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.
our acquisitions may not perform as expected.
historically, acquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy. we may continue to grow our business through acquisitions. although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories, we will have a limited or no history of owning and operating many of these businesses and possibly limited or no experience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located. some of these businesses may have been government owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. if we were to acquire any of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that:
•   we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership;
•   such businesses will perform as expected;
•   integration or other one-time costs will not be greater than expected;
•   we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities;
•   such businesses will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them; or
•   the rate of return from such businesses will justify our decision to invest capital to acquire them.
risks associated with governmental regulation and laws our operations are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes.
our ability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any ability to obtain expected or contracted increases in electricity tariff or contract rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts' expectations. furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly at our utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to:
•   changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs to be included in the rates we charge our customers, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental regulations;
•   changes in the determination of what is an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or a determination that a utility's operating income or the rates it charges customers are too high, resulting in a reduction of rates or consumer rebates;
•   changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non-controllable costs;
•   adverse changes in tax law;
•   changes in law or regulation which limit or otherwise affect the ability of our counterparties (including sovereign or private parties) to fulfill their obligations (including payment obligations) to us or our subsidiaries;
•   changes in environmental law which impose additional costs or limit the dispatch of our generating facilities within our subsidiaries;
•   changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;
•   changes in the timing of tariff increases;
•   other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions;
•   other changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business; or
| 2019 annual report
•   other changes that impact the short- or long-term price-setting mechanism in the markets where we operate.
any of the above events may result in lower operating margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our business.
in many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing and it may be difficult to predict the impact of the regulations on our businesses. the impacts described above could also result from our (or our subsidiaries') efforts to comply with european market infrastructure regulation, which includes regulations related to the trading, reporting and clearing of derivatives. it is also possible that additional similar regulations may be passed in other jurisdictions where we conduct business. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the company.
several of our businesses are subject to potentially significant remediation expenses, enforcement initiatives, private party lawsuits and reputational risk associated with ccr.
ccr, which consists of bottom ash, fly ash and air pollution control wastes generated at our current and former coal-fired generation plant sites, is currently handled and/or has been handled in the past in the following ways: placement in onsite ccr ponds; disposal and beneficial use in onsite and offsite permitted, engineered landfills; use in various beneficial use applications, including encapsulated uses and structural fill; and used in permitted offsite mine reclamation. ccr currently remains onsite at several of our facilities, including in ccr ponds. the u.s. epa's final ccr rule, which became effective in october 2015, regulates ccr as nonhazardous solid waste and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new ccr landfills and existing and new ccr ponds, including location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring, corrective action and closure requirements and post-closure care. on december 16, 2016, president obama signed the win act into law, which includes provisions to implement the ccr rule through a state permitting program, or if the state chooses not to participate, a possible federal permit program. the primary enforcement mechanisms under this regulation could be actions commenced by u.s. epa, states, or territories, and private lawsuits. compliance with the u.s. federal ccr rule; amendments to the federal ccr rule; or federal, state, territory, or foreign rules or programs addressing ccr may require us to incur substantial costs. in addition, the company and our businesses may face ccr-related lawsuits in the united states and/or internationally that may expose us to unexpected potential liabilities. furthermore, ccr-related litigation may also expose us to unexpected costs. in addition, ccr, and its production at several of our facilities, have been the subject of significant interest from environmental non-governmental organizations and have received national and local media attention. the direct and indirect effects of such media attention, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may divert management time and attention. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects.
our business in the united states is subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered in whole or in part by ferc and nerc, including purpa, the fpa, and the epact 2005. actions by ferc, nerc and by state utility commissions can have a material effect on our operations.
the aes corporation is a registered electric holding company under the u.s. public utility holding company act of 2005 ("puhca 2005") as enacted as part of the epact 2005. puhca 2005 eliminated many of the restrictions that had been in place under the u.s. public utility holding company act of 1935, while continuing to provide ferc and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. puhca 2005 also creates additional potential challenges and opportunities. by removing some barriers to mergers and other potential combinations, the creation of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies is more likely. these entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the u.s. market.
other parts of the epact 2005 allow ferc to remove the purpa purchase/sale obligations from utilities if there are adequate opportunities to sell into competitive markets. ferc has exercised this power with a rebuttable presumption that utilities located within the control areas of miso, pjm, iso new england, inc., the new york independent system operator, inc., and ercot are not required to purchase or sell power from or to qfs above a certain size. additionally, ferc has the power to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a case-by-case basis. while these changes do not affect existing contracts, certain of our qfs that have had sales
| 2019 annual report contracts expire are now facing a more difficult market environment and that is likely to continue for other aes qfs with existing contracts that will expire over time.
in accordance with congressional mandates in the epact 1992 and the epact 2005, ferc has strongly encouraged competition in wholesale electric markets. increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins. among other steps, ferc has encouraged rtos and isos to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. these programs may reduce the value of generation assets. similarly, ferc is encouraging the construction of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of epact 2005. although new transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also increase the competition in our existing markets.
ferc has civil penalty authority over violations of any provision of part ii of the fpa, which concerns wholesale generation or transmission, as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. the fpa also provides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under the fpa. this penalty authority was enhanced in epact 2005. as a result, ferc is authorized to assess a maximum penalty authority established by statute and such penalty authority has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically to account for inflation. with this expanded enforcement authority, violations of the fpa and ferc's regulations could potentially have more serious consequences than in the past.
pursuant to epact 2005, the nerc has been certified by ferc as the electric reliability organization ("ero") to develop mandatory and enforceable electric system reliability standards applicable throughout the u.s. to improve the overall reliability of the electric grid. these standards are subject to ferc review and approval. once approved, the reliability standards may be enforced by ferc independently, or, alternatively, by the ero and regional reliability organizations with responsibility for auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to ferc oversight. violations of nerc reliability standards are subject to ferc's penalty authority under the fpa and epact 2005.
our utility businesses in the u.s. face significant regulation by their respective state utility commissions. the regulatory discretion is reasonably broad in both indiana and ohio and includes regulation as to services and facilities, the valuation of property, the construction, purchase, or lease of electric generating facilities, the classification of accounts, rates of depreciation, the increase or decrease in retail rates and charges, the issuance of certain securities, the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities and certain other matters. these businesses face the risk of unexpected or adverse regulatory action which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. see item 1.-business-us and utilities sbu for further information on the regulation faced by our u.s. utilities.
our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations.
our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, international treaties and foreign governmental authorities. these laws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation. failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain or comply with any associated environmental permits could result in fines or other sanctions. for example, in recent years, the epa has issued notices of violation ("novs") to a number of coal-fired generating plants alleging wide-spread violations of the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the caa. the epa has brought suit against and obtained settlements with many companies for allegedly making major modifications to a coal-fired generating units without proper permit approvals and without installing best available control technology. the primary focus of these novs has been emissions of so2 and nox and the epa has imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce such emissions. in addition, state regulatory agencies and non-governmental environmental organizations have pursued civil lawsuits against power plants in situations that have resulted in judgments and/or settlements requiring the installation of expensive pollution controls or the accelerated retirement of certain electric generating units.
furthermore, congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air emissions and water discharges. these laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. see the various descriptions of these laws and regulations contained in item 1.-business-environmental and land-use regulations of this form 10-k.
65 | 2019 annual report we have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. changes in, or new development of, environmental restrictions may force us to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial condition, including recorded asset values or results of operations, would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in domestic or foreign environmental laws and regulations.
concerns about ghg emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact our businesses.
international, federal and various regional and state authorities regulate ghg emissions and have created financial incentives to reduce them. in 2019, the company's subsidiaries operated businesses that had total co2 emissions of approximately 55 million metric tonnes, approximately 23 million of which were emitted by our u.s. businesses (both figures are ownership adjusted). the company uses co2 emission estimation methodologies supported by "the greenhouse gas protocol" reporting standard on ghg emissions. for existing power generation plants, co2 emissions data are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type co2 emission factors. the estimated annual co2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric power generation facilities of the company's subsidiaries that are in construction or development and have received the necessary air permits for commercial operations are approximately 7 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). this overall estimate is based on a number of projections and assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, such as the forecasted dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, co2 emissions rates and our subsidiaries' achieving completion of such construction and development projects. however, it is certain that the projects under construction or development when completed will increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks associated with regulation of ghg emissions. because there is significant uncertainty regarding these estimates, actual emissions from these projects under construction or development may vary substantially from these estimates.
there currently is no u.s. federal legislation imposing mandatory ghg emission reductions (including for co2) that affects our electric power generation facilities; however, in 2015, the epa promulgated a rule establishing new source performance standards for co2 emissions for newly constructed and modified/reconstructed fossil-fueled eusgus larger than 25 mw and in 2018 proposed revisions to the rule. in 2019, the epa promulgated the affordable clean energy (ace) rule replacing the epa's 2015 clean power plan (cpp), which was revoked in 2019. the ace rule establishes heat rate improvement measures as the best system of emissions reductions for existing coal-fired electric generating units. these actions have been challenged in court and the current administration has announced plans to significantly amend or rescind the rules. in 2010, the epa adopted regulations pertaining to ghg emissions that require new and existing sources of ghg emissions to potentially obtain new source review permits from the epa prior to construction or modification. in 2016, the u.s. supreme court ruled that such permitting would only be required if such sources also must obtain a new source review permit for increases in other regulated pollutants.
for further discussion of the regulation of ghg emissions, including the u.s. supreme court's issued order staying implementation of the cpp, and the epa's proposal to rescind the cpp, see item 1.-business-environmental and land-use regulations-united states environmental and land-use legislation and regulations-greenhouse gas emissions above.
in december 2015, the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change convened for the 21st conference of the parties and the resulting paris agreement established a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature well below 2°c above pre-industrial levels. we anticipate that the paris agreement will continue the trend toward efforts to de-carbonize the global economy and to further limit ghg emissions. on november 4, 2019, the u.s. announced that it had officially notified the u.n. that the u.s. will withdraw from the paris agreement as soon as november 4, 2020.
the impact of ghg regulation on our operations will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the degree and timing of ghg emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulation, the cost of emissions reduction equipment and the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive ghg emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. the costs of compliance could be substantial.
66 | 2019 annual report our non-utility, generation subsidiaries seek to pass on any costs arising from co2 emissions to contract counterparties. likewise, our utility subsidiaries seek to pass on any costs arising from co2 emissions to customers. however, there can be no assurance that we will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or customers, respectively, or that the cost and burden associated with any dispute over which party bears such costs would not be burdensome and costly.
in addition to government regulators, many groups, including politicians, environmentalists, the investor community and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about ghg emissions. new regulation, such as the initiatives in chile and the puerto rico energy public policy act, may adversely affect our operations. see item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-key trends and uncertainties-decarbonization initiatives. responding to these decarbonization initiatives may present challenges to our business. we may be unable to develop our renewables platform as quickly as anticipated. further, we may be unable to dispose of coal-fired generation assets at anticipated prices, the estimated useful lives of these assets may decrease, and the value of such assets may be impaired. these initiatives could also result in the early retirement of coal-fired generation facilities, which could result in stranded costs if regulators disallow full recovery of investments.
negative public perception of our ghg emissions could have an adverse effect on our relationships with third parties, our ability to attract additional customers, our business development opportunities, and our ability to access finance and insurance for our coal-fired generation assets.
in addition, plaintiffs previously brought tort lawsuits against the company because of its subsidiaries' ghg emissions. while these lawsuits were dismissed, future similar lawsuits may prevail or result in damages awards or other relief. we may also be subject to risks associated with the impact on weather conditions. see certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and hydrology and severe weather and natural disasters may present significant risks to our business and adversely affect our financial results within this section for more information. if any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on our electric power generation businesses and on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition,cash flows and reputation.
concerns about data privacy have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact our businesses.
in the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information, including personal identification information about customers and employees, customer energy usage and other information. the theft, damage or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data collected by us can subject us to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, subject us to claims from third parties, require compliance with notification and monitoring regulations, and harm our reputation. the eu gdpr applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the eu, creates additional compliance obligations and significantly increases fines for noncompliance. furthermore, the california consumer privacy act ("ccpa") has recently introduced new requirements that have broad effect, the impact of which is uncertain at this time. any actual or perceived failure to comply with the gdpr, the ccpa, the general data privacy law in brazil or other data privacy laws or regulations, or related contractual or other obligations, or any perceived privacy rights violation, could lead to investigations, claims, and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties, damages for contract breach, and other significant costs, penalties, and other liabilities, as well as harm to our reputation and market position. in addition, any actual or perceived failure on the part of one of our equity affiliates could result in a decrease in the value of our investment as well as harm to our reputation and future business prospects.
tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
our subsidiaries have operations in the u.s. and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. as such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the u.s. federal, state and local governments and of many non-u.s. jurisdictions. from time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax positions regarding income or other taxes. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these legislative measures.
the tcja enacted december 22, 2017 introduced significant changes to current u.s. federal tax law. these changes are complex and are subject to additional guidance to be issued by the u.s. treasury and the internal revenue service. in addition, the reaction to the federal tax changes by the individual states is evolving. our
| 2019 annual report interpretations and assumptions around u.s. tax reform may evolve in future periods as further administrative guidance and regulations are issued, which may materially affect our effective tax rate or tax payments. for further details, please see item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-key trends and uncertainties in this form 10-k.
additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine how and where cross-border international trade is subjected to tax are evolving. the organization for economic cooperation and development, in coordination with the g8 and g20, through its base erosion and profit shifting project introduced a series of recommendations that many tax jurisdictions have adopted, or may adopt in the future, as law. as these and other tax laws, related regulations and double-tax conventions change, our financial results could be materially impacted. given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our results of operations.
u.s. federal, state and local, as well as non-u.s., tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. there can be no assurance that our tax positions will be sustained if challenged by relevant tax authorities and if not sustained, there could be a material impact on our results of operations.
we and our affiliates are subject to material litigation and regulatory proceedings.
we and our affiliates are parties to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. see item 3.- legal proceedings below. there can be no assurances that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.
risks related to our indebtedness and financial condition we have a significant amount of debt, a large percentage of which is secured, that could adversely affect our business and our ability to fulfill our obligations.
as of december 31, 2019, we had approximately $20 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis. all outstanding borrowings, if any, under the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility and secured term loan are secured by certain of our assets, including the pledge of capital stock of many of the aes corporation's directly held subsidiaries. most of the debt of the aes corporation's subsidiaries is secured by substantially all of the assets of those subsidiaries. since we have such a high level of debt, a substantial portion of cash flow from operations must be used to make payments on this debt. furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are used to secure this debt, this reduces the amount of collateral available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces our flexibility in operating these secured assets. this high level of indebtedness and related security could have other important consequences to us and our investors, including:
•   making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations at the holding company and/or individual subsidiaries;
•   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions, including but not limited to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices;
•   reducing available cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business;
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;
•   placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and
•   limiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.
the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, limit, but do not prohibit the incurrence of additional indebtedness. if we were to become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. further, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. accordingly, our cash flows may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and, in that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt as it becomes due. in addition, our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. any refinancing of our debt could come at higher interest rates or may require us to comply with onerous covenants, which could restrict our business
| 2019 annual report operations. see note 11.-debt included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for a schedule of our debt maturities.
the aes corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise.
the aes corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. almost all of the aes corporation's cash flow is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries. therefore, the aes corporation's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of the subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, tax sharing payments, loans or otherwise.
our subsidiaries face various restrictions in their ability to distribute cash. most of the subsidiaries are obligated, pursuant to loan agreements, indentures or non-recourse financing arrangements, to satisfy certain restricted payment covenants or other conditions before they may make distributions to the aes corporation. business performance and local accounting and tax rules may also limit dividend distributions. subsidiaries in foreign countries may also be prevented from distributing funds to the aes corporation as a result of foreign governments restricting the repatriation of funds or the conversion of currencies.
the aes corporation's subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, unless they have expressly guaranteed any of the aes corporation's indebtedness, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to such debt or to make any funds available whether by dividends, fees, loans or other payments.
existing and potential future defaults by subsidiaries or affiliates could adversely affect the aes corporation.
we attempt to finance our domestic and foreign projects primarily under loan agreements and related documents that, except as noted below, require the loans to be repaid solely from the project's revenues and provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of that project subsidiary or affiliate. this type of financing is usually referred to as non-recourse debt or "non-recourse financing." in some non-recourse financings, the aes corporation has explicitly agreed to undertake certain limited obligations and contingent liabilities, most of which by their terms will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events. these obligations and liabilities take the form of guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, letter of credit reimbursement agreements and agreements to pay, in certain circumstances, the project lenders or other parties.
as of december 31, 2019, we had approximately $20 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, of which approximately $3.4 billion was recourse debt of the aes corporation and approximately $16.7 billion was non-recourse debt. in addition, we have outstanding guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, and other credit support commitments which are further described in this form 10-k in item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-capital resources and liquidity-parent company liquidity.
some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. the total debt classified as current in our consolidated balance sheets related to such defaults was $325 million as of december 31, 2019. while the lenders under our non-recourse financings generally do not have direct recourse to the aes corporation (other than to the extent of any credit support given by the aes corporation), defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for the aes corporation, including, without limitation:
•   reducing the aes corporation's receipt of subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other sources of cash since the project subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the aes corporation during the pendency of any default;
•   under certain circumstances, triggering the aes corporation's obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support which the aes corporation may have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;
•   triggering defaults in the aes corporation's outstanding debt. for example, the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility, secured term loan, and outstanding senior notes include events of default for certain
| 2019 annual report bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. in addition, the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility includes certain events of default relating to accelerations of outstanding material debt of material subsidiaries or any subsidiaries that in the aggregate constitute a material subsidiary; or
•   foreclosure on the assets that are pledged under the non-recourse loans, resulting in write-downs of assets and eliminating any and all potential future benefits derived from those assets.
none of the projects that are currently in default are owned by subsidiaries that individually or in the aggregate meet the applicable standard of materiality in the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility or other debt agreements in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under such indebtedness. however, as a result of future mix of distributions, write-down of assets, dispositions and other matters that affect our financial position and results of operations, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries, individually or in the aggregate, could fall within the applicable standard of materiality and thereby upon an acceleration of such subsidiary's debt, trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility or other indebtedness of the aes corporation.
the aes corporation has significant cash requirements and limited sources of liquidity.
the aes corporation requires cash primarily to fund:
•   principal repayments of debt;
•   interest;
•   acquisitions;
•   construction and other project commitments;
•   other equity commitments, including business development investments;
•   equity repurchases and/or cash dividends on our common stock;
•   taxes; and
•   parent company overhead costs.
the aes corporation's principal sources of liquidity are:
•   dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries;
•   proceeds from debt and equity financings at the parent company level; and

for a more detailed discussion of the aes corporation's cash requirements and sources of liquidity, please see item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-capital resources and liquidity in this form 10-k.
while we believe that these sources will be adequate to meet our obligations at the parent company level for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, which could prove incorrect, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital or commercial lending markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, exchange rates, our ability to sell assets, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and other distributions. there can be no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected. in addition, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay at maturity the entire principal outstanding under our credit facility, term loan, and our debt securities and we may have to refinance such obligations. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all and any of these events could have a material effect on us.
our ability to grow our business depends on our ability to raise capital on favorable terms.
from time to time, we rely on access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. our ability to arrange for financing on either a recourse or non-recourse basis and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:
•   general economic and capital market conditions;
•   the availability of bank credit;
•   the financial condition, performance and prospects of the aes corporation in general and/or that of any subsidiary requiring the financing;
| 2019 annual report
•   the financial condition, performance and prospects of other companies in our industry or with similar financial circumstances; and
•   changes in tax and securities laws which are conducive to raising capital.
should access to capital not be available to us, we may have to sell assets or decide not to build new plants, or expand or improve existing facilities, either of which would affect our future growth, results of operations or financial condition.
difficulty raising sufficient capital to fund development projects in less developed economies could affect our growth strategy.
part of our growth strategy is to develop businesses in less developed economies where the return on our investment may be greater than projects in more developed economies. commercial lending institutions sometimes refuse to provide non-recourse project financing in certain less developed economies, and in these situations we have sought and may continue to seek direct or indirect (through credit support or guarantees) project financing from a limited number of multilateral or bilateral international financial institutions or agencies. as a precondition to making such project financing available, the lending institutions may also require governmental guarantees for certain project and sovereign-related risks. there can be no assurance, however, that project financing from the international financial agencies or that governmental guarantees will be available when needed, and if they are not, we may have to abandon the relevant project or invest more of our own funds, which may not be in line with our investment objectives and would leave less funds for other projects.
a downgrade in the credit ratings of the aes corporation or its subsidiaries could adversely affect our access to the capital markets, increase our interest costs and/or adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow.
if any of the credit ratings of the the aes corporation and its subsidiaries were to be downgraded, our ability to raise capital on favorable terms could be impaired and our borrowing costs could increase. in addition, the recent downgrade in the credit ratings of dpl inc. and dp&l may impact the cost of refinancing their respective debt securities as they come due. furthermore, depending on the aes corporation's credit ratings and the trading prices of its equity and debt securities, counterparties may no longer be as willing to accept general unsecured commitments by the aes corporation to provide credit support. accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, the aes corporation may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit and/or collateral, to backstop or replace any credit support by the aes corporation. there can be no assurance that such counterparties will accept such guarantees or that aes could arrange such further assurances in the future. in addition, to the extent the aes corporation is required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, it will limit the amount of credit available to the aes corporation to meet its other liquidity needs.
the market price of our common stock may be volatile.
the market price and trading volumes of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future. factors that could affect the price of our common stock include, among other factors, general conditions in our industry and the power markets in which we participate, environmental and economic developments, and general credit and capital markets conditions, as well as developments specific to us, including risks that could result in revenue and earnings volatility, failing to meet our publicly announced guidance or other risk factors described in item 1a.-risk factors and key trends and other matters described in item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary in 2019, aes achieved significant milestones towards its strategic objectives, including investing in sustainable growth and innovative solutions to deliver superior results. we completed construction of 2.2 gw of new projects and signed long-term ppas for 2.8 gw of renewable capacity. fluence, our joint venture with siemens, maintained its leading global market share with 1.1 gw of projects delivered or awarded in 2019. we announced the merger of simple energy into uplight and formed a 10-year strategic alliance with google to develop and implement solutions to enable broad adoption of clean energy. finally, following our efforts to reduce recourse debt, our parent company's credit rating was upgraded to investment grade by fitch. see overview of our strategy included in item 1.-business of this form 10-k for further information.
compared with last year, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased $1.03, from $1.48 to $0.45. this decrease was largely driven by prior year net gains on dispositions of masinloc, electrica santiago and ctng transmission lines, lower generation in argentina and chile and higher impairments in the current year, and the impact on margin from the sale of businesses in prior periods. these decreases were partially offset by current year contributions from new businesses, lower losses on extinguishment of debt in 2019, and prior year income tax expense to finalize the impact of the tcja.
adjusted eps, a non-gaap measure, increased $0.12, from $1.24 to $1.36, reflecting higher contributions from new businesses, including u.s. renewables and the colon combined cycle facility in panama, a lower effective tax rate, and lower parent company interest in 2019, partially offset by the impact on margin from the sale of businesses in prior periods.

revenue
(in millions)
consolidated revenue - revenue decreased $547 million, or 5%, in 2019 compared to 2018. excluding the unfavorable fx impact of $133 million, primarily in south america, this decrease was driven by:
•   $229 million in south america primarily driven by lower generation and prices in argentina and lower contract sales and generation in chile;
•   $173 million in eurasia primarily due to the sales of the masinloc power plant in march 2018 and the northern ireland businesses in june 2019; and
•   $172 million in us and utilities primarily driven by the closure of generation facilities at dpl in the first half of 2018 and shady point in may 2019, and lower energy prices and sales due to higher temperatures and other favorable market conditions present in 2018 as compared to 2019 at southland, partially offset by price increases due to the 2018 rate orders at ipl and dpl and an increase in energy pass-through costs in el salvador.
these unfavorable impacts were partially offset by an increase of $156 million in mcac driven by the commencement of operations at the colon combined cycle facility in panama in september 2018.
operating margin
(in millions)
consolidated operating margin - operating margin decreased $224 million, or 9%, in 2019 compared to 2018. excluding the unfavorable impact of fx of $46 million, primarily in south america, this decrease was driven by:
•   $107 million in south america primarily due to the drivers discussed above;
•   $46 million in mcac due to the outage at changuinola as a result of upgrading the tunnel lining and lower hydrology in panama as compared to the prior year, partially offset by the business interruption insurance
| 2019 annual report recoveries at the andres facility in dominican republic, higher contract sales at panama, and the commencement of operations at the colon combined cycle facility in panama; and
•   $31 million in eurasia primarily due to the drivers discussed above, partially offset by lower depreciation at the jordan plants due to their classification as held-for-sale.
these unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a $21 million increase in us and utilities mostly driven by the 2018 rate orders at ipl and dpl, partially offset by the lost margin from the sale and closure of generation facilities at shady point and dpl, and increased rock ash disposal at puerto rico.

revenue
(in millions)
consolidated revenue - revenue increased $206 million, or 2%, in 2018 compared to 2017. excluding the unfavorable fx impact of $52 million, primarily in south america partially offset by eurasia, this increase was driven by:
•   $357 million in south america primarily due to higher contract sales and prices in colombia and the commencement of new ppas at angamos and cochrane in chile, as well as higher capacity prices in argentina resulting from market reforms enacted in 2017;
•   $215 million in mcac primarily due to to the commencement of operations at the colon combined cycle facility as well as improved hydrology at panama, higher pass-through fuel prices in mexico, higher contracted energy sales due to commencement of operations at the los mina combined cycle facility in june 2017, and higher spot prices in the dominican republic; and
•   $68 million in us and utilities driven primarily by higher market energy sales at southland, higher regulated rates commencing in november 2017 at dpl, higher wholesale volume due to the new ccgt coming online as well as higher retail demand at ipl, and higher prices due to tariff reset and higher energy prices in el salvador, partially offset by the sale and closure of several generation facilities at dpl.
these favorable impacts were partially offset by decreases of $366 million in eurasia due to the sale of the masinloc power plant in march 2018, as well as the sale of the kazakhstan chps and expiration of the kazakhstan hpp concession agreement in 2017.
| 2019 annual report operating margin
(in millions)
consolidated operating margin - operating margin increased $108 million, or 4%, in 2018 compared to 2017. excluding the favorable impact of fx of $8 million, primarily driven by eurasia, this increase was driven by:
•   $154 million in south america primarily due to the drivers discussed above and the absence of maintenance costs for planned outages in 2018 versus maintenance performed in q3 2017 at gener chile;
•   $70 million in mcac primarily due to drivers discussed above; and
•   $40 million in us and utilities mostly due to the drivers discussed above and the favorable impact of a one time reduction in the aro liability at dpl's closed plants, stuart and killen.
these favorable impacts were partially offset by a decrease of $204 million in eurasia due to the drivers discussed above.

general and administrative expenses decreased $23 million, or 11%, to $192 million for 2018 compared to $215 million for 2017, primarily due to reduced people costs, professional fees and business development activity.
interest expense interest expense decreased $6 million, or 1%, to $1,050 million for 2019, compared to $1,056 million for 2018 primarily due to the reduction of debt mainly at the parent company and dpl, reduced interest rates on refinanced debt at dpl, and favorable foreign currency translation at tietê, partially offset by lower capitalized interest due to the commencement of operations at colon facility in september 2018, a decrease in afudc for the eagle valley ccgt project at ipl, and the loss of hedge accounting at alto maipo in 2018, which resulted in favorable unrealized mark-to-market adjustments recognized within interest expense.
interest expense decreased $114 million, or 10%, to $1,056 million for 2018, compared to $1,170 million for 2017 primarily due to the reduction of debt at the parent company, favorable impacts from interest rate swaps in chile, and increased capitalized interest at alto maipo.
interest income interest income increased $8 million, or 3%, to $318 million for 2019, compared to $310 million for 2018 primarily in south america driven by a higher average interest rate on cammesa receivables.
| 2019 annual report interest income increased $66 million, or 27%, to $310 million for 2018, compared to $244 million for 2017 primarily due to higher interest rates and increased long-term receivables as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in 2018.
loss on extinguishment of debt loss on extinguishment of debt decreased $19 million, or 10%, to $169 million for 2019, compared to $188 million for 2018. this decrease was primarily due to losses of $171 million at the parent company resulting from the redemption of senior notes in 2018 compared to losses of $45 million at dpl, $31 million at mong duong, $29 million at gener, $28 million at colon, and $24 million at cochrane in 2019 resulting from the redemption or refinancing of senior notes.
loss on extinguishment of debt increased $120 million to $188 million for 2018, compared to $68 million for 2017. this increase was primarily due to higher losses at the parent company of $79 million from the redemption of senior notes in 2018 and a 2017 gain on early retirement of debt at aes argentina of $65 million, partially offset by lower losses at other subsidiaries of $24 million in 2018.
see note 11-debt included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
other income other income increased $73 million, to $145 million for 2019, compared to $72 million for 2018 primarily due to gains on insurance recoveries associated with property damage at the andres facility and upgrading the tunnel lining at changuinola. these increases were partially offset by a gain on remeasurement of contingent liabilities for projects in hawaii in 2018.
other income decreased $48 million, or 40%, to $72 million for 2018, compared to $120 million for 2017 primarily due to the 2017 favorable settlement of legal proceedings at uruguaiana related to ypf's breach of the parties' gas supply agreement and a decrease in afudc in the us and utilities sbu. these decreases were partially offset by a gain on remeasurement of contingent liabilities for projects in hawaii in 2018.
other expense other expense increased $22 million, or 38%, to $80 million for 2019, compared to $58 million for 2018 primarily due to losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases at distributed energy and the loss on disposal of assets at changuinola associated with upgrading the tunnel lining in 2019. this was partially offset by the loss on disposal of assets resulting from damage associated with a lightning incident at the andres facility in the dominican republic in 2018.
other expense remained flat at $58 million for 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to a loss resulting from damage associated with a lightning incident at the andres facility in the dominican republic in 2018 and higher non-service pension and other postretirement costs in 2018. this was offset by the 2017 write-off of water rights for projects that were no longer being pursued in the south america sbu and a loss on disposal of assets at dpl as a result of the decision to close the coal-fired and diesel-fired generating units at stuart and killen.
see note 21-other income and expense included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
gain (loss) on disposal and sale of business interests gain on disposal and sale of business interests decreased to $28 million for 2019, as compared to $984 million for 2018 primarily due to the 2018 gains on sale of masinloc of $772 million, ctng of $126 million, and electrica santiago of $70 million.
gain on disposal and sale of business interests was $984 million for 2018 as compared to a loss of $52 million for 2017, primarily due to the 2018 gains on sale discussed above, and the 2017 losses on sales of kazakhstan chps and hpps of $49 million and $33 million, respectively, partially offset by the 2017 recognition of a $23 million gain related to the expiration of a contingency at masinloc.

asset impairment expense asset impairment expense decreased $23 million, or 11%, to $185 million for 2019, compared to $208 million for 2018. this decrease was primarily driven by $115 million as a result of an impairment analysis performed at kilroot and ballylumford upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria in 2019 and $60 million at hawaii due to a decrease in the economic useful life of the coal-fired asset, compared to prior year impairments of $157 million at shady point due to an unfavorable economic outlook creating uncertainty around future cash flows and $37 million at nejapa due to the landfill owner's failure to perform improvements necessary to continue extracting gas.
asset impairment expense decreased $329 million, or 61%, to $208 million for 2018, compared to $537 million for 2017 mainly driven by 2017 impairments of $186 million recognized in kazakhstan due to the classification of the chps and hpps as held-for-sale and $296 million in the u.s. as a result of the decision to sell the dpl peaker assets and a decline in forward pricing at laurel mountain, partially offset by a 2018 impairment of $157 million due to decreased future cash flows and the decision to sell shady point.

(2)   includes losses of $31 million, gains of $23 million, and losses of $21 million on foreign currency derivative contracts for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
the company recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of $67 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily driven by unrealized losses on foreign currency derivatives related to government receivables in argentina and unrealized losses associated with the devaluation of long-term receivables denominated in the argentine peso.
the company recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of $72 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily due to the devaluation of long-term receivables denominated in argentine pesos, partially offset by gains at the parent company related to foreign currency derivatives.
the company recognized net foreign currency transaction gains of $42 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily driven by transactions associated with vat activity in mexico, the amortization of frozen embedded derivatives in the philippines, and appreciation of the euro in bulgaria. these gains were partially offset by foreign currency derivative losses in colombia due to a change in functional currency.
other non-operating expense other non-operating expense was $92 million in 2019 due to the other-than-temporary impairment of the opgc equity method investment as a result of the estimated market value of the company's investment and other negative developments impacting future expected cash flows at the investee.
other non-operating expense was $147 million in 2018 primarily due to the $144 million other-than-temporary impairment of the guacolda equity method investment as a result of increased renewable generation in chile lowering energy prices and impacting the ability of guacolda to re-contract its existing ppas after they expire.
there were no significant other non-operating expenses in 2017.

income tax expense income tax expense decreased $356 million to $352 million in 2019 as compared to $708 million for 2018. the company's effective tax rate was 35% for both years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018.
the 2019 effective tax rate was impacted by the nondeductible losses on the sale of the company's entire 100% interest in the kilroot coal and oil-fired plant and energy storage facility and the ballylumford gas-fired plant in the united kingdom and associated asset impairments during the second quarter. further impacting the 2019 effective tax rate were the effects of the argentine peso devaluation to tax expense, as well as to pretax income for nondeductible unrealized losses on foreign currency derivatives related to government receivables in argentina. the 2018 effective tax rate was impacted by the increase in the staff accounting bulletin no.118 ("sab 118") adjustment with respect to the estimate of the one-time transition tax and deferred tax remeasurement under the tcja. this impact was partially offset by the impact of the sale of the company's entire 51% equity interest in masinloc. see note 25- held-for-sale and dispositions and note 23-income taxes included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for details and impacts of the sales.
income tax expense decreased $282 million to $708 million in 2018 as compared to $990 million for 2017. the company's effective tax rates were 35% and 128% for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
the net decrease in the 2018 effective tax rate was primarily due to greater 2017 impacts related to u.s. tax reform one-time transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets, relative to the 2018 u.s. tax reform impact to adjust the provisional estimate recorded under sab 118, which provides sec guidance on the application of the accounting standards for the initial enactment impacts of the tcja. this net decrease was also attributable to the impact of the sale of the company's entire 51% equity interest in masinloc, offset by taxation of our foreign subsidiaries under u.s. gilti rules.
our effective tax rate reflects the tax effect of significant operations outside the u.s., which are generally taxed at rates different than the u.s. statutory rate. foreign earnings may be taxed at rates higher than the u.s. corporate rate of 21% and are also subject to current u.s. taxation under the gilti rules introduced by the tcja. a future proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions could impact our periodic effective tax rate. the company also benefits from reduced tax rates in certain countries as a result of satisfying specific commitments regarding employment and capital investment. see note 23-income taxes included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for additional information regarding these reduced rates.
net equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates net equity in earnings of affiliates decreased $211 million to losses of $172 million in 2019, compared to earnings of $39 million in 2018. this was primarily driven by a $158 million decrease in earnings due to a long-lived asset impairment at guacolda, a $19 million decrease in earnings at opgc due to a contract termination charge, and a $20 million decrease in earnings at spower due to the impairment of certain development projects.
net equity in earnings of affiliates decreased $32 million, or 45%, to $39 million for 2018, compared to $71 million for 2017 primarily due to losses at fluence, which was formed in the first quarter of 2018, decreased income at guacolda, and larger gains on projects that achieved commercial operations in 2017 than in 2018 at spower, which was purchased in the third quarter of 2017.
see note 8-investments in and advances to affiliates included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
net income (loss) from discontinued operations net loss from discontinued operations was $1 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. net income from discontinued operations was $216 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 primarily due to the after-tax gain on sale of eletropaulo of $199 million recognized in the second quarter of 2018 and the recognition of a $26 million deferred gain upon liquidation of borsod in october 2018.
net loss from discontinued operations was $629 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to the after-tax loss on deconsolidation of eletropaulo of $611 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. the
86 | 2019 annual report remaining loss was due to a loss contingency recognized by our equity affiliate, partially offset by the income from operations of eletropaulo prior to the date of deconsolidation.
see note 24-discontinued operations included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries decreased $187 million, or 52%, to $175 million in 2019, compared to $362 million in 2018. this decrease was primarily due to:
•   prior year gains on sales of electrica santiago and ctng in chile;
•   lower earnings in chile primarily due to current year long-lived asset impairment at guacolda, losses on extinguishment of debt and lower contracted energy sales and prices;
•   hlbv allocation of losses to noncontrolling interests at distributed energy as a result of renewable projects reaching cod in 2019; and
•   lower earnings in panama primarily due to lower hydrology and the outage at changuinola as a result of upgrading the tunnel lining.
these decreases were partially offset by:
•   prior year other-than-temporary impairment of guacolda.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries decreased $22 million, or 6%, to $362 million in 2018, compared to $384 million in 2017. this decrease was primarily due to:
•   other-than-temporary impairment of guacolda;
•   favorable impact of a legal settlement at uruguaiana in 2017; and
•   lower earnings due to deconsolidation of eletropaulo in november 2017 and the sale of masinloc in march 2018.
these decreases were partially offset by:
•   gains on sales of electrica santiago and ctng in chile;
•   higher earnings in colombia primarily due to higher contract sales and prices; and
•   higher earnings in vietnam due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.
net income attributable to the aes corporation net income attributable to the aes corporation decreased $900 million, or 75%, to $303 million in 2019, compared to $1,203 million in 2018. this decrease was primarily due to:
•   prior year gains on the sales of masinloc, eletropaulo (reflected within discontinued operations), ctng and electrica santiago, net of tax;
•   current year long-lived asset impairments at guacolda, hawaii, kilroot and ballylumford, and other-than-temporary impairment at opgc;
•   current year loss on sale at kilroot and ballylumford;
•   current year losses on extinguishment of debt at dpl, aes gener, mong duong and colon;
•   current year losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases at distributed energy;
•   the impact of sold businesses in our eurasia sbu;
•   lower margins at argentina and chile, primarily due to lower generation; and
•   lower margins at changuinola, driven by the outage as a result of upgrading the tunnel lining and lower hydrology in panama.
these decreases were partially offset by:
•   prior year income tax expense to finalize the initial impact of u.s. tax reform enacted in december 2017;
•   prior year loss on extinguishment of debt at the parent company;
•   prior year long-lived asset impairments at shady point and nejapa, and other-than-temporary impairment at guacolda;

•   current year gains on insurance proceeds associated with the lightning incident at the andres facility in 2018 and the changuinola tunnel leak;
•   current year gain on sale of a portion of our interest in spower's operating assets and gain on disposal of stuart and killen at dpl; and
•   higher earnings at our us and utilities sbu, primarily as a result of renewable projects that came online in the current year.
net income attributable to the aes corporation increased $2,364 million to $1,203 million in 2018, compared to a loss of $1,161 million in 2017. this increase was primarily due to:
•   gains on the sales of masinloc, eletropaulo (reflected within discontinued operations), ctng, and electrica santiago in 2018, and losses on the sales of kazakhstan chps and hpps in 2017;
•   loss on deconsolidation of eletropaulo (reflected within discontinued operations) in 2017;
•   impact of u.s. tax reform enacted in december 2017;
•   asset impairments at dpl, laurel mountain and in kazakhstan in 2017;
•   lower interest expense at the parent company and gener; and
•   higher margins at our south america, mcac and us and utilities sbus.
these increases were partially offset by:
•   higher tax expense in 2018 due to the new gilti rules in the u.s.;
•   asset impairment at shady point and other-than-temporary impairment of guacolda;
•   higher losses on extinguishment of debt;
•   foreign exchange losses in 2018 primarily due to the devaluation of the argentine peso and foreign currency gains in 2017;
•   favorable impact of a legal settlement at uruguaiana in 2017; and
•   lower margins at our eurasia sbu as a result of the sales of masinloc and kazakhstan.
sbu performance analysis segments we are organized into four market-oriented sbus: us and utilities (united states, puerto rico and el salvador); south america (chile, colombia, argentina and brazil); mcac (mexico, central america and the caribbean); and eurasia (europe and asia).
non-gaap measures adjusted operating margin, adjusted ptc and adjusted eps are non-gaap supplemental measures that are used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as investors, industry analysts and lenders.
for the year ended december 31, 2019, the company changed the definitions of adjusted ptc and adjusted eps to exclude gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases. we believe these transactions are economically similar to sales of business interests and excluding these gains or losses better reflects the underlying business performance of the company.
adjusted operating margin we define adjusted operating margin as operating margin, adjusted for the impact of nci, excluding (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions; (b) benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures; and (c) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations and office consolidation. the allocation of hlbv earnings to noncontrolling interests is not adjusted out of adjusted operating margin. see review of consolidated results of operations for definitions of operating margin and cost of sales.
the gaap measure most comparable to adjusted operating margin is operating margin. we believe that adjusted operating margin better reflects the underlying business performance of the company. factors in this determination include the impact of nci, where aes consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly
| 2019 annual report owned by the company, as well as the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests. adjusted operating margin should not be construed as an alternative to operating margin, which is determined in accordance with gaap.

adjusted ptc we define adjusted ptc as pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to the aes corporation excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; and (f) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations and office consolidation. adjusted ptc also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities.
adjusted ptc reflects the impact of nci and excludes the items specified in the definition above. in addition to the revenue and cost of sales reflected in operating margin, adjusted ptc includes the other components of our consolidated statement of operations, such as general and administrative expenses in the corporate segment, as well as business development costs, interest expense and interest income, other expense and other income, realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and net equity in earnings of affiliates.
the gaap measure most comparable to adjusted ptc is income from continuing operations attributable to the aes corporation. we believe that adjusted ptc better reflects the underlying business performance of the company and is the most relevant measure considered in the company's internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests, retire debt or implement restructuring initiatives, which affect results in a given period or periods. in addition, adjusted ptc represents the business performance of the company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the company
89 | 2019 annual report operates. given its large number of businesses and complexity, the company concluded that adjusted ptc is a more transparent measure that better assists investors in determining which businesses have the greatest impact on the company's results.
adjusted ptc should not be construed as an alternative to income from continuing operations attributable to the aes corporation, which is determined in accordance with gaap.

adjusted eps we define adjusted eps as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, the tax impact from the repatriation of sales proceeds, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; (f) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations and office consolidation; and (g) tax benefit or expense related to the enactment effects of 2017 u.s. tax law reform and related regulations and any subsequent period adjustments related to enactment effects.
the gaap measure most comparable to adjusted eps is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. we believe that adjusted eps better reflects the underlying business performance of the company and is considered in the company's internal evaluation of financial performance. factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities
90 | 2019 annual report remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests, retire debt or implement restructuring initiatives, which affect results in a given period or periods. adjusted eps should not be construed as an alternative to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which is determined in accordance with gaap.
the company reported a loss from continuing operations of $0.77 per share for the year ended december 31, 2017. for purposes of measuring diluted loss per share under gaap, common stock equivalents were excluded from weighted average shares as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. however, for purposes of computing adjusted eps, the company has included the impact of anti-dilutive common stock equivalents. the table below reconciles the weighted average shares used in gaap diluted loss per share to the weighted average shares used in calculating the non-gaap measure of adjusted eps. no reconciliation is necessary for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 as the company reported income from continuing operations.

fiscal year 2019 versus 2018
operating margin increased $21 million, or 3%, which was driven primarily by the following (in millions):
increase at ipl primarily driven by higher retail rates following the 2018 rate order, partially offset by lower volumes due to unfavorable weather and higher maintenance expense related to distribution line clearance     $59
increase at dpl due to the 2018 distribution rate order, including the decoupling rider which is designed to eliminate the impacts of weather and demand, partially offset by changes to dpl's esp                             22
decrease due to the sale and closure of generation facilities at shady point and dpl, including cost recoveries from dpl's joint owners of stuart and killen                                                                  (47   )

95 | 2019 annual report key trends and uncertainties during 2020 and beyond, we expect to face the following challenges at certain of our businesses. management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses, growth from new businesses, and global cost reduction initiatives may lessen or offset their impact. if these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move more unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may impact our operating margin, net income attributable to the aes corporation and cash flows. we continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. for the risk factors related to our business, see item 1.-business and item 1a.-risk factors of this form 10-k.
macroeconomic and political the macroeconomic and political environments in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have changed during 2019. this could result in significant impacts to tax laws and environmental and energy policies. additionally, we operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at the subsidiary level. see item 7a.-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further information.
argentina - in the run up to the 2019 presidential elections, the argentine peso devalued significantly and the government of argentina imposed capital controls and announced a restructuring of argentina's debt payments. restrictions on the flow of capital have limited the availability of international credit, and economic conditions in argentina have further deteriorated, triggering additional devaluation of the argentine peso and a deterioration of the country's risk profile.
on october 27, 2019, alberto fernández was elected president. the entering administration has started evaluating measures to respond to the argentine economic crisis. on february 27, 2020, the secretariat of energy passed resolution no. 31/2020 that includes the denomination of tariffs in local currency indexed by local inflation, and reductions in capacity payments received by generators. these regulatory changes are expected to have a negative impact on our financial results.
although the situation remains unresolved, it has not had a material impact on our current exposures to date, and payments on the long-term receivables for the foninvemem agreements are current. for further information, see note 7-financing receivables included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k.
chile - in october 2019, chile saw significant protests associated with economic conditions resulting in the declaration of a state of emergency in several major cities.
in november 2019, the chilean government enacted law 21,185 that establishes a stabilization fund for regulated energy prices. historically, the government updated the prices for regulated energy contracts every six months to reflect the indexation the contracts have to exchange rates and commodities prices. the new law freezes regulated prices and does not allow the pass-through of these contractual indexation updates to customers beyond the pricing in effect at july 1, 2019, until new lower-cost renewable contracts are incorporated into pricing in 2023. consequently, costs incurred in excess of the july 1, 2019 price will be accumulated and borne by generators. aes gener has deferred collection of approximately $30 million of revenue at year end. it is expected such amounts deferred will be fully repaid to generators prior to december 31, 2027. in addition, the chilean energy ministry has not yet released regulations pursuant to this law; therefore, certain aspects of the impact of law 21,185 are uncertain at this time.
other initiatives to address the concerns of the protesters, including potential constitutional amendments, are under consideration by congress and could result in regulatory changes that may affect our results of operations in chile.
puerto rico - our subsidiaries in puerto rico have a long-term ppa with state-owned prepa, which has been facing economic challenges that could result in a material adverse effect on our business in puerto rico.
the puerto rico oversight, management, and economic stability act ("promesa") was enacted to create a structure for exercising federal oversight over the fiscal affairs of u.s. territories and created procedures for adjusting debt accumulated by the puerto rico government and, potentially, other territories ("title iii"). promesa also expedites the approval of key energy projects and other critical projects in puerto rico.
| 2019 annual report promesa allowed for the establishment of an oversight board with broad powers of budgetary and financial control over puerto rico. the oversight board filed for bankruptcy on behalf of prepa under title iii in july 2017. as a result of the bankruptcy filing, aes puerto rico and aes ilumina's non-recourse debt of $287 million and $33 million, respectively, continue to be in default and are classified as current as of december 31, 2019. the company is in compliance with its debt payment obligations as of december 31, 2019.
the company's receivable balances in puerto rico as of december 31, 2019 totaled $74 million, of which $20 million was overdue. despite the title iii protection, prepa has been making substantially all of its payments to the generators in line with historical payment patterns.
on january 2, 2020, the governor of puerto rico signed a bill that prohibits the disposal and unencapsulated beneficial use of coal combustion residuals in puerto rico. prior to this bill's approval, the company had put in place arrangements to dispose or beneficially use its coal ash and combustion residual outside of puerto rico.
significant earthquakes and subsequent aftershocks hit puerto rico in late december 2019 and january 2020. these events did not result in damage to our assets in puerto rico. we expect that aes puerto rico will continue to play a critical role in ensuring reliability for customers.
considering the information available as of the filing date, management believes the carrying amount of our long-lived assets in puerto rico of $538 million is recoverable as of december 31, 2019.
reference rate reform - in july 2017, the uk financial conduct authority announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021. in the u.s., the alternative reference rate committee at the federal reserve identified the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") as its preferred alternative rate for libor; alternative reference rates in other key markets are under development. aes holds a substantial amount of debt and derivative contracts referencing libor as an interest rate benchmark. although the full impact of the reform remains unknown, we have begun to engage with aes counterparties to discuss specific action items to be undertaken in order to prepare for amendments when they become due.
united states tax law reform federal taxes - in december 2017, the united states enacted the tcja. the legislation significantly revised the u.s. corporate income tax system by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate, introducing new limitations on interest expense deductions, subjecting foreign earnings in excess of an allowable return to current u.s. taxation, and adopting a semi-territorial corporate tax system. these changes impacted our 2018 and 2019 effective tax rates and may materially impact our effective tax rate in future periods. furthermore, we anticipate that growth in our u.s. businesses and higher u.s. tax expense may fully utilize our remaining net operating loss carryforwards in the near term, which could lead to material cash tax payments in the united states. our interpretation of the tcja may change as the u.s. treasury and the internal revenue service issue additional guidance. such changes may be material. for example, the company anticipates that regulations proposed in 2019 related to the gilti high-tax exception will be finalized in and made effective for 2020. our 2020 tax rate will be materially impacted if such final regulations are not issued in 2020. our interim tax rates may also be impacted if such regulations are finalized later in 2020.
state taxes - the reactions of the individual states to federal tax reform are still evolving. most states will assess whether and how the federal changes will be incorporated into their state tax legislation. as we expect higher taxable income in the future at the federal level, this may also lead to higher state taxable income. our current state tax provisions predominantly have full valuation allowances against state net operating losses. these positions will be re-assessed in the future as state tax law evolves and may result in material changes in position.
decarbonization initiatives several initiatives have been announced by regulators and offtakers in recent years, with the intention of reducing ghg emissions generated by the energy industry. our strategy of shifting towards clean energy platforms, including renewable energy, energy storage, lng and modernized grids is designed to position us for continued growth while reducing our carbon intensity. the shift to renewables has caused certain customers to migrate to other low-carbon energy solutions and this trend may continue. certain of our contracts contain clauses designed to compensate for early contract terminations, but we cannot guarantee full recovery. although the company cannot currently estimate the financial impact of these decarbonization initiatives, new legislative or regulatory programs further restricting carbon emissions could require material capital expenditures, result in a reduction of the estimated useful life of certain coal facilities, or have other material adverse effects on our financial results. for further discussion of our strategy of shifting towards clean energy platforms see item 1-executive summary.
| 2019 annual report chilean decarbonization plan - the chilean government has announced an initiative to phase out coal power plants by 2040 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. on june 4, 2019, aes gener signed an agreement with the chilean government to cease the operation of two coal units for a total of 322 mw as part of the phase-out. under the agreement, ventanas 1 (114 mw) will cease operation in november 2022 and ventanas 2 (208 mw) in may 2024. these units will remain connected to the grid as "strategic operating reserve" for up to five years after ceasing operations, will receive a reduced capacity payment and will be dispatched, if necessary, to ensure the electric system's reliability. see item 1-business-south america sbu-chile for further discussion. considering the information available as of the filing date, management believes the carrying amount of our coal-fired long-lived assets in chile of $2.8 billion is recoverable as of december 31, 2019.
puerto rico energy public policy act - on april 11, 2019, the governor of puerto rico signed the puerto rico energy public policy act ("the act") establishing guidelines for grid efficiency and eliminating coal as a source for electricity generation by january 1, 2028. the act supports the accelerated deployment of renewables through the renewable portfolio standard and the conversion of coal generating facilities to other fuel sources, with compliance targets of 40% by 2025, 60% by 2040, and 100% by 2050. aes puerto rico's long-term ppa with prepa expires november 30, 2027. unless the act is amended or a waiver from its provisions is obtained, aes puerto rico will need to convert fuel sources to continue operating. prepa and aes puerto rico have begun discussing conversion options, but any plan would be subject to lender and regulatory approval, including that of the oversight board that filed for bankruptcy on behalf of prepa. we considered the act an indicator of impairment for the long-lived assets at aes puerto rico in the second quarter; however, the carrying value of the asset group was recoverable. see impairments for further information.
for further information about the risks associated with decarbonization initiatives, see item 1a.-risk factors-concerns about ghg emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact our businesses included in this form 10-k.
regulatory maritza ppa review - the dg comp continues to review whether maritza's ppa with nek is compliant with the european commission's state aid rules. although no formal investigation has been launched by dg comp to date, maritza has engaged in discussions with the dg comp case team and representatives of bulgaria to discuss the agency's review. in the near term, maritza expects that it will engage in discussions with bulgaria to attempt to reach a negotiated resolution concerning dg comp's review. the anticipated discussions could involve a range of potential outcomes, including but not limited to termination of the ppa and payment of some level of compensation to maritza. any negotiated resolution would be subject to mutually acceptable terms, lender consent, and dg comp approval. at this time, we cannot predict the outcome of the anticipated discussions between maritza and bulgaria, nor can we predict how dg comp might resolve its review if the discussions fail to result in an agreement concerning the review. maritza believes that its ppa is legal and in compliance with all applicable laws, and it will take all actions necessary to protect its interests, whether through negotiated agreement or otherwise. however, there can be no assurances that this matter will be resolved favorably; if it is not, there could be a material adverse impact on maritza's and the company's respective financial statements.
considering the information available as of the filing date, management believes the carrying value of our long-lived assets at maritza of approximately $1.1 billion is recoverable as of december 31, 2019.
dp&l rate case - on november 21, 2019, the puco issued an order modifying dp&l's esp by removing the dmr. effective december 18, 2019, the puco partially approved dp&l's subsequent request to revert to the prior esp rates and maintain several other riders that were previously in effect; however, certain of those riders were disallowed. in the first quarter of 2020, dp&l filed a separate petition seeking authority to record regulatory assets to accrue revenues that would have otherwise been collected under the esp through the decoupling rider. the outcome of this petition is unknown at this time. see item 1.-business-us and utilities sbu-dpl of this form 10-k for further information.
foreign exchange we operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between our functional currency, the usd, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. in 2018 and 2019, there was a significant devaluation in the argentine peso against the usd, which had an impact on our 2018 and 2019 results. continued material devaluation of the argentine peso against the usd could
| 2019 annual report have an impact on our future results. the argentine economy continues to be considered highly inflationary under u.s. gaap; as such, all of our argentine businesses are reported using the usd as the functional currency. for additional information, refer to item 7a.-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
changuinola tunnel leak in early 2019, the company confirmed loss of water in specific tunnel sections of the changuinola power plant, a 223 mw hydroelectric power facility in panama. as a result, about one third of the tunnel, or 1.6 kilometers, required upgraded lining to ensure long-term performance of the facility. the upgrade to the lining was completed and the affected units were placed back in service in january 2020. see note 21-other income and expense included included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data, and other income and expense included in item 7.- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10-k for further information.
impairments long-lived assets and equity affiliates - during the year ended december 31, 2019, the company recognized asset and other-than-temporary impairment expenses of $277 million. see note 8-investments in and advances to affiliates and note 22-asset impairment expense included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information. after recognizing these impairment expenses, the carrying value of our investments in equity affiliates and long-lived assets that were assessed for impairment in 2019 totaled $892 million at december 31, 2019.
events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate recoverability tests and potential impairments of long-lived assets may include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation, or an expectation it is more likely than not the asset will be disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life.
goodwill - the company considers a reporting unit at risk of impairment when its fair value does not exceed its carrying amount by more than 10%. during the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of october 1, 2019, the company determined that the fair value of its gener reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 3%. therefore, gener's $868 million goodwill balance was considered to be "at risk" as of december 31, 2019, largely due to the chilean government's announcement to phase out coal generation by 2040, and a decline in long-term energy prices.
through 2028, gener's plants remain largely contracted, with most of its ppas expiring between 2029 and 2042. the company utilized the income approach in deriving the fair value of the gener reporting unit, which included estimated cash flows based on the estimated useful lives of the underlying generating asset class. these cash flows were discounted using a weighted average cost of capital of 7%, which was determined based on the capital asset pricing model. see item 7.-critical accounting policies and estimates-fair value of nonfinancial assets and liabilities and note 9-goodwill and other intangible assets included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
the company monitors its reporting units at risk of impairment for interim impairment indicators, and believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the calculations are reasonable as of december 31, 2019. should the fair value of any of the company's reporting units fall below its carrying amount because of reduced operating performance, market declines, changes in the discount rate, regulatory changes, or other adverse conditions, goodwill impairment charges may be necessary in future periods.
capital resources and liquidity overview as of december 31, 2019, the company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion, of which $13 million was held at the parent company and qualified holding companies. the company had $400 million in short-term investments, held primarily at subsidiaries, and restricted cash and debt service reserves of $543 million. the company also had non-recourse and recourse aggregate principal amounts of debt outstanding of $16.7 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. of the $1.9 billion of our current non-recourse debt, $1.5 billion was presented as such
| 2019 annual report because it is due in the next twelve months and $320 million relates to debt considered in default due to covenant violations. none of the defaults are payment defaults, but are instead technical defaults triggered by failure to comply with other covenants or other conditions contained in the non-recourse debt documents due to the bankruptcy of the offtaker.
we expect current maturities of non-recourse debt to be repaid from net cash provided by operating activities of the subsidiary to which the debt relates, through opportunistic refinancing activity, or some combination thereof. we have $5 million of recourse debt which matures within the next twelve months. from time to time, we may elect to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise when management believes that such securities are attractively priced. such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements and other factors. the amounts involved in any such repurchases may be material.
we rely mainly on long-term debt obligations to fund our construction activities. we have, to the extent available at acceptable terms, utilized non-recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric power plants, distribution companies and related assets. our non-recourse financing is designed to limit cross-default risk to the parent company or other subsidiaries and affiliates. our non-recourse long-term debt is a combination of fixed and variable interest rate instruments. debt is typically denominated in the currency that matches the currency of the revenue expected to be generated from the benefiting project, thereby reducing currency risk. in certain cases, the currency is matched through the use of derivative instruments. the majority of our non-recourse debt is funded by international commercial banks, with debt capacity supplemented by multilaterals and local regional banks.
given our long-term debt obligations, the company is subject to interest rate risk on debt balances that accrue interest at variable rates. when possible, the company will borrow funds at fixed interest rates or hedge its variable rate debt to fix its interest costs on such obligations. in addition, the company has historically tried to maintain at least 70% of its consolidated long-term obligations at fixed interest rates, including fixing the interest rate through the use of interest rate swaps. these efforts apply to the notional amount of the swaps compared to the amount of related underlying debt. presently, the parent company's only material unhedged exposure to variable interest rate debt relates to drawings of $180 million under its senior secured credit facility. on a consolidated basis, of the company's $20.4 billion of total gross debt outstanding as of december 31, 2019, approximately $3.3 billion bore interest at variable rates that were not subject to a derivative instrument which fixed the interest rate. brazil holds $1.1 billion of our floating rate non-recourse exposure as we have no ability to fix local debt interest rates efficiently.
in addition to utilizing non-recourse debt at a subsidiary level when available, the parent company provides a portion, or in certain instances all, of the remaining long-term financing or credit required to fund development, construction or acquisition of a particular project. these investments have generally taken the form of equity investments or intercompany loans, which are subordinated to the project's non-recourse loans. we generally obtain the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sales of assets and/or the proceeds from our issuances of debt, common stock and other securities. similarly, in certain of our businesses, the parent company may provide financial guarantees or other credit support for the benefit of counterparties who have entered into contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity, equipment, or other services with our subsidiaries or lenders. in such circumstances, if a business defaults on its payment or supply obligation, the parent company will be responsible for the business' obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit support. at december 31, 2019, the parent company had provided outstanding financial and performance-related guarantees or other credit support commitments to or for the benefit of our businesses, which were limited by the terms of the agreements, of approximately $865 million in aggregate (excluding those collateralized by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below).
as a result of the parent company's split rating, some counterparties may be unwilling to accept our general unsecured commitments to provide credit support. accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, the parent company may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit, to backstop or replace our credit support. the parent company may not be able to provide adequate assurances to such counterparties. to the extent we are required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, this will reduce the amount of credit available to us to meet our other liquidity needs. at december 31, 2019, we had $342 million in letters of credit outstanding provided under our unsecured credit facility, and $19 million in letters of credit outstanding provided under our senior secured credit facility. these letters of credit operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development and construction activities and
| 2019 annual report business operations. during the year ended december 31, 2019, the company paid letter of credit fees ranging from 1% to 3% per annum on the outstanding amounts.
we expect to continue to seek, where possible, non-recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that we or our affiliates may develop, construct or acquire. however, depending on local and global market conditions and the unique characteristics of individual businesses, non-recourse debt may not be available on economically attractive terms or at all. if we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a subsidiary project that is under construction or has near-term debt payment obligations and that subsidiary is unable to obtain additional non-recourse debt, such subsidiary may become insolvent, and we may lose our investment in that subsidiary. additionally, if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer, the subsidiary may need to withdraw from a project or restructure the non-recourse debt financing. if we or the subsidiary choose not to proceed with a project or are unable to successfully complete a restructuring of the non-recourse debt, we may lose our investment in that subsidiary.
many of our subsidiaries depend on timely and continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity needs. the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, to refinance existing indebtedness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economic uncertainty may have material adverse effects on the financial condition and results of operations of those subsidiaries. in addition, changes in the timing of tariff increases or delays in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions could affect the cash flows and results of operations of our businesses.

parent company liquidity the following discussion is included as a useful measure of the liquidity available to the aes corporation, or the parent company, given the non-recourse nature of most of our indebtedness. parent company liquidity as outlined below is a non-gaap measure and should not be construed as an alternative to cash and cash equivalents, which is determined in accordance with gaap. parent company liquidity may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. the principal sources of liquidity at the parent company level are dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, including refinancing proceeds, proceeds from debt and equity financings at the parent company level, including availability under our credit facility, and proceeds from asset sales. cash requirements at the parent company level are primarily to fund interest and principal repayments of debt, construction commitments, other equity commitments, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, taxes, parent company overhead and development costs, and dividends on common stock.
the company defines parent company liquidity as cash available to the parent company plus available borrowings under existing credit facility plus cash at qualified holding companies. the cash held at qualified holding
107 | 2019 annual report companies represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the u.s. such subsidiaries have no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to the parent company. parent company liquidity is reconciled to its most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measure, cash and cash equivalents, at the periods indicated as follows (in millions):
december 31, 2019          december 31, 2018
consolidated cash and cash equivalents                                     $1,029                     $1,166

the company utilizes its parent company credit facility for short-term cash needs to bridge the timing of distributions from its subsidiaries throughout the year. we expect that the parent company credit facilities' borrowings will be repaid by the end of the year.
the parent company paid dividends of $0.55 per share to its common stockholders during the year ended december 31, 2019. while we intend to continue payment of dividends and believe we will have sufficient liquidity to do so, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends, or if continued, the amount of such dividends.
recourse debt our total recourse debt was $3.4 billion and $3.7 billion at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. see note 11-debt in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for additional detail.
we believe that our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, currency exchange rates, power market pool prices, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. in addition, our subsidiaries' ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us (at the parent company level) is subject to certain limitations contained in loans, governmental provisions and other agreements. we can provide no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that the actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated. we have met our interim needs for shorter-term and working capital financing at the parent company level with our senior secured credit facility. see item 1a.-risk factors-the aes corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its public debt securities, is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise, of this form 10-k.
various debt instruments at the parent company level, including our senior secured credit facility, contain certain restrictive covenants. the covenants provide for, among other items, limitations on other indebtedness; liens, investments and guarantees; limitations on dividends, stock repurchases and other equity transactions; restrictions and limitations on mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, leases, transactions with affiliates and off-balance sheet and derivative arrangements; maintenance of certain financial ratios; and financial and other reporting requirements. as of december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with these covenants at the parent company level.
non-recourse debt while the lenders under our non-recourse debt financings generally do not have direct recourse to the parent company, defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for our results of operations and liquidity, including, without limitation:
•   reducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the parent company during the time period of any default;
•   triggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support we have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;
•   causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; and
•   triggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the parent company.
108 | 2019 annual report for example, our senior secured credit facility and outstanding debt securities at the parent company include events of default for certain bankruptcy-related events involving material subsidiaries. in addition, our revolving credit agreement at the parent company includes events of default related to payment defaults and accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries.
some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. the total non-recourse debt classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets amounts to $1.9 billion. the portion of current debt related to such defaults was $320 million at december 31, 2019, all of which was non-recourse debt related to two subsidiaries - aes puerto rico and aes ilumina. an additional $5 million of debt in default exists at the subsidiary aes jordan solar which was classified as a current held-for-sale liability at december 31, 2019. none of the defaults are payment defaults, but are instead technical defaults triggered by failure to comply with other covenants or other conditions contained in the non-recourse debt documents due to the bankruptcy of the offtaker. see note 11-debt in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for additional detail.
none of the subsidiaries that are currently in default are subsidiaries that met the applicable definition of materiality under the parent company's debt agreements as of december 31, 2019, in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under the parent company's indebtedness. however, as a result of additional dispositions of assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results of operations or the financial position of the individual subsidiary, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a "material subsidiary" and thereby trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the parent company's outstanding debt securities. a material subsidiary is defined in the parent company's senior secured credit facility as any business that contributed 20% or more of the parent company's total cash distributions from businesses for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters. as of december 31, 2019, none of the defaults listed above individually or in the aggregate resulted in or is at risk of triggering a cross-default under the recourse debt of the parent company.

_____________________________
(1)   excludes normal and customary representations and warranties in agreements for the sale of assets (including ownership in associated legal entities) where the associated risk is considered to be nominal.
we have a diverse portfolio of performance-related contingent contractual obligations. these obligations are designed to cover potential risks and only require payment if certain targets are not met or certain contingencies occur. the risks associated with these obligations include change of control, construction cost overruns, subsidiary default, political risk, tax indemnities, spot market power prices, sponsor support and liquidated damages under power sales agreements for projects in development, in operation and under construction. in addition, we have an asset sale program through which we may have customary indemnity obligations under certain assets sale agreements. while we do not expect that we will be required to fund any material amounts under these contingent contractual obligations beyond 2019, many of the events which would give rise to such obligations are beyond our control. we can provide no assurance that we will be able to fund our obligations under these contingent contractual obligations if we are required to make substantial payments thereunder.
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements of aes are prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap, which requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. aes' significant accounting policies are described in note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
an accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, different estimates reasonably could have been used, or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.
management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee, as appropriate. listed below are the company's most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes - we are subject to income taxes in both the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities. certain of the company's subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. the company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each tax jurisdiction when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. tax reserves have been established, which the company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. while the company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may be materially different than the reserve amounts.
because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix could materially impact our effective tax rate. furthermore, our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof and such changes may be more likely or become more likely in view of recent economic trends in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
110 | 2019 annual report in accordance with sab 118, the company made reasonable estimates of the impacts of u.s. tax reform on its 2017 financial results, and recorded adjustments to those estimates in 2018 as analysis was completed. as of december 31, 2018, our analysis of the one-time impacts of the tcja was complete under sab 118. however, in the first quarter of 2019, the u.s. treasury department issued final regulations on the one-time transition tax which included changes from the proposed regulations issued in 2018.
in addition, no taxes have been recorded on undistributed earnings for certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. should the earnings be remitted as dividends, the company may be subject to additional foreign withholding and state income taxes.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax bases. the company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. the company has elected to treat gilti as an expense in the period in which the tax is accrued. accordingly, no deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded related to gilti.
sales of noncontrolling interests - sales of noncontrolling interests are recognized within stockholders' equity. effective january 1, 2018, the company adopted asu no. 2017-05, other income-gains and losses from the derecognition of nonfinancial assets, which clarified the accounting for the sale of business interests as either the sale of nonfinancial assets or the sale of businesses. among other things, under the newly adopted guidance fewer transactions are expected to meet the definition of a business under the scope of asc 810 and will fall under the scope of the sale of nonfinancial assets.
prior to january 1, 2018, the accounting for a sale of noncontrolling interests was dependent on whether the sale was considered a sale of in-substance real estate, where the gain (loss) on sale would be recognized in earnings rather than within stockholders' equity. in-substance real estate is composed of land plus improvements and integral equipment. the determination of whether property, plant and equipment is integral equipment is based on the significance of the costs to remove the equipment from its existing location (including the cost of repairing damage resulting from the removal), combined with the decrease in the fair value of the equipment as a result of those removal activities. when the combined total of removal costs and the decrease in fair value of the equipment exceeds 10% of the fair value of the equipment, the equipment is considered integral equipment. the accounting standards specifically identify power plants as an example of in-substance real estate. where the consolidated entity in which noncontrolling interests have been sold contains in-substance real estate, management estimates the extent to which the total fair value of the assets of the entity is represented by the in-substance real estate and whether significant value exists beyond the in-substance real estate. this estimation considers all qualitative and quantitative factors relevant for each sale and, where appropriate, includes making quantitative estimates about the fair value of the entity and its identifiable assets and liabilities (including any favorable or unfavorable contracts) by analogy to the accounting standards on business combinations. as such, these estimates may require significant judgment and assumptions, similar to the critical accounting estimates discussed below for impairments and fair value.
impairments - our accounting policies on goodwill and long-lived assets are described in detail in note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies, included in item 8 of this form 10-k. the company makes considerable judgments in its impairment evaluations of goodwill and long-lived assets, starting with determining if an impairment indicator exists. events that may result in an impairment analysis being performed include, but are not limited to: adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation, or an expectation it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. the company exercises judgment in determining if these events represent an impairment indicator requiring the computation of the fair value of goodwill and/or the recoverability of long-lived assets. the fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part in an impairment evaluation. please see fair value below for further detail.
as part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. the level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. our impairment evaluations inherently involve
111 | 2019 annual report uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.
further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the company can be found within note 9-goodwill and other intangible assets and note 22-asset impairment expense to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
depreciation - depreciation, after consideration of salvage value and asset retirement obligations, is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are determined on a composite or component basis. the company considers many factors in its estimate of useful lives, including expected usage, physical deterioration, technological changes, existence and length of off-take agreements, and laws and regulations, among others. in certain circumstances, these estimates involve significant judgment and require management to forecast the impact of relevant factors over an extended time horizon.
useful life estimates are continually evaluated for appropriateness as changes in the relevant factors arise, including when a long-lived asset group is tested for recoverability. depreciation studies are performed periodically for assets subject to composite depreciation. any change to useful lives is considered a change in accounting estimate and is made on a prospective basis.
fair value - for information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
fair value of financial instruments - a significant number of the company's financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. the company's investments are primarily certificates of deposit and mutual funds. derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. the company's derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. additional discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in note 5-fair value included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
fair value of nonfinancial assets and liabilities - significant estimates are made in determining the fair value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill) during the impairment evaluation process. in addition, the majority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination and asset acquisitions by vies are required to be recognized at fair value under the relevant accounting guidance.
the company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. the company generally utilizes the income approach to value nonfinancial assets and liabilities, specifically a discounted cash flow ("dcf") model to estimate fair value by discounting cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate.
management applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our cash flow forecasts. examples of the input assumptions that our forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices, and commodity prices. whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources (e.g., economic intelligence unit) and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. it is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factor expectations and related assumptions. as a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts.
a considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the dcf model. to the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., bloomberg). the company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the
112 | 2019 annual report most likely market participants. it is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate.
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities - we enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. we primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity, and foreign currency exposures. we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. see note 6-derivative instruments and hedging activities included in item 8 of this form 10-k for further information on the classification.
the fair value measurement standard requires the company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. these factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). due to the nature of the company's interest rate swaps, which are typically associated with non-recourse debt, credit risk for aes is evaluated at the subsidiary level rather than at the parent company level. nonperformance risk on the company's derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize observable market inputs.
as a result of uncertainty, complexity, and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. as a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our counterparty's), and future exchange rates. refer to note 5-fair value included in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional details.
the fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal and third party valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs, including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. the company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., bloomberg, reuters and platt's). in some cases, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instrument's fair value. in certain instances, the published curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. specifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exchange contracts, beyond the traded points the company utilizes the interest rate differential approach to construct the remaining portion of the forward curve. additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on "indicative pricing" quotes from financial institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. these indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid or ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. for individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value.
regulatory assets - management continually assesses whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, any asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating income.
consolidation - the company enters into transactions impacting the company's equity interests in its affiliates. in connection with each transaction, the company must determine whether the transaction impacts the company's consolidation conclusion by first determining whether the transaction should be evaluated under the variable interest model or the voting model. in determining which consolidation model applies to the transaction, the company is required to make judgments about how the entity operates, the most significant of which are whether (i) the entity has sufficient equity to finance its activities, (ii) the equity holders, as a group, have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and (iii) whether the entity has non-substantive voting rights.
if the entity is determined to be a variable interest entity, the most significant judgment in determining whether the company must consolidate the entity is whether the company, including its related parties and de facto agents, collectively have power and benefits. if aes is determined to have power and benefits, the entity will be consolidated by aes.
alternatively, if the entity is determined to be a voting model entity, the most significant judgments involve determining whether the non-aes shareholders have substantive participating rights. the assessment of shareholder rights and whether they are substantive participating rights requires significant judgment since the rights provided under shareholders' agreements may include selecting, terminating, and setting the compensation of
113 | 2019 annual report management responsible for implementing the subsidiary's policies and procedures, and establishing operating and capital decisions of the entity, including budgets, in the ordinary course of business. on the other hand, if shareholder rights are only protective in nature (referred to as protective rights), then such rights would not overcome the presumption that the owner of a majority voting interest shall consolidate its investee. significant judgment is required to determine whether minority rights represent substantive participating rights or protective rights that do not affect the evaluation of control. while both represent an approval or veto right, a distinguishing factor is the underlying activity or action to which the right relates.
pension and other postretirement plans - the company recognizes a net asset or liability reflecting the funded status of pension and other postretirement plans with current-year changes in actuarial gains or losses recognized in aocl, except for those plans at certain of the company's regulated utilities that can recover portions of their pension and postretirement obligations through future rates. the valuation of the company's benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and net periodic benefit costs requires various estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. these assumptions are reviewed by the company on an annual basis. refer to note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies included in item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
revenue recognition - the company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of energy, capacity, and other services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled. in applying the revenue model, we determine whether the sale of energy, capacity, and other services represent a single performance obligation based on the individual market and terms of the contract. generally, the promise to transfer energy and capacity represent a performance obligation that is satisfied over time and meets the criteria to be accounted for as a series of distinct goods or services. progress toward satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured using output methods, such as mwhs delivered or mws made available, and when we are entitled to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly to the value of our performance completed to date, we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have the right to invoice. for further information regarding the nature of our revenue streams and our critical accounting policies affecting revenue recognition, see note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
leases - the company recognizes operating and finance right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for most leases with an initial term of greater than 12 months. lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. our subsidiaries' incremental borrowing rates are used in determining the present value of lease payments when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as prepayments, lease incentives, or initial direct costs. for further information regarding the nature of our leases and our critical accounting policies affecting leases, see note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies included in item 8 of this form 10-k.

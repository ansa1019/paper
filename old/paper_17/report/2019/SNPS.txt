item 1a. risk factors a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below. investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock.
the growth of our business depends primarily on the semiconductor and electronics industries.
the growth of the electronic design automation (eda) industry as a whole, our semiconductor & system design segment product sales, and to some extent our software integrity segment product sales, is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries. a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers, systems companies, and their customers. the increasing complexity of designs of systems-on-chips, integrated circuits, electronic systems and customers' concerns about managing costs, have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general, with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process or opting for less advanced, but less risky, manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products. demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls. additionally, as the eda industry has matured, consolidation has resulted in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors. this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins, which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
furthermore, the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems. many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries. our customers also frequently incorporate third-party ip, whether provided by us or other vendors, into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process. we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda, ip, and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes. similarly, we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip, particularly microprocessor ip, to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products, which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip, work effectively together. if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries' manufacturing processes or major ip providers' products, or if our access to such foundry processes or third-party ip products is hampered, then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate, as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, may negatively impact our operating results.
a number of business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships, among our customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers, increased customer bargaining power, or reduced customer spending on software and services. furthermore, we depend on a relatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us, for a large portion of our revenue. reduced customer spending or the loss of a small number of customers, particularly our large customers, could adversely affect our business and financial condition. in addition, we and our competitors from time to time acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings. if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer, they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio, additional support and service capability, or lower prices, which could negatively impact our business and operating results.
the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business.
we derive roughly half of our revenue from sales outside the united states, and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the u.s. we have also continually expanded our non-u.s. operations. this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the u.s. our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks, including:
•   ineffective or weaker legal protection of intellectual property rights;
•   uncertain economic and political conditions in countries where we do business;
•   government trade restrictions, including tariffs, export licenses, or other trade barriers, and changes to existing trade arrangements between various countries;
•   difficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business, which may include business practices in which we are prohibited from engaging by the foreign corrupt practices act or other anti-corruption laws;
•   financial risks such as longer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;
•   inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions;
•   additional taxes, interest, and potential penalties, and uncertainty around changes in tax laws of various countries; and
•   other factors beyond our control such as natural disasters, terrorism, civil unrest, war and infectious diseases.
furthermore, if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations, our business and results of operations will be harmed.
as our business volume increases in the asia pacific region, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between certain asian countries and the united states, that political, diplomatic, or military events could result in trade disruptions, including tariffs, trade embargoes, export restrictions and other trade barriers. a significant trade disruption, export restriction, or the establishment or increase of any trade barrier in any area where we do business could reduce customer demand and cause customers to search for substitute products and services, make our products and services more expensive or unavailable for customers, increase the cost of our products and services, have a negative impact on customer confidence and spending, make our products less competitive, or otherwise have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits, our customers' and suppliers' businesses, and our results of operations.
for example, beginning in may 2019, the united states government placed certain entities on the "entity list," restricting the sale of u.s. technologies to the named entities. as a result of this government action, we are not able to book new business with these entities, and revenue associated with these entities is put "on hold" until either the contract expires, or the restriction is lifted. in response to that action or similar actions taken by the united states, other countries may adopt tariffs and trade barriers that could limit our ability to offer our products and services. current and potential customers who are concerned or affected by such tariffs or restrictions may respond by developing their own products or replacing our solutions, which would have an adverse effect on our business. in addition, government or customer efforts, attitudes, laws, or policies regarding technology independence may lead to non-u.s. customers favoring their domestic technology solutions that could compete with or replace our products, which would also have an adverse effect on our business.
in addition to tariffs and other trade barriers, our global operations are subject to numerous u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and other disclosures, privacy and labor relations. these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly. in addition, there is uncertainty regarding how proposed, contemplated or future changes to these complex laws and regulations could affect our business. we may incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by these laws and regulations, and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall. if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines, penalties or criminal sanctions, and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents or partners will not violate such laws and regulations. any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.
our financial results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. a weakening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into u.s. dollars in our consolidated statements of operations. likewise, a strengthening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, including the renminbi or yen, reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation. exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations. although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity, we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
uncertainty in the global economy, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular, may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
while the global economy has been relatively strong in recent years, there are still uncertainties surrounding the strength of economic recovery in many regions. uncertainty caused by challenging global economic conditions could lead some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us. such caution by customers could, among other things, limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts.
we cannot predict the stability of the economy as a whole or the industries in which we operate. further economic instability could adversely affect the banking and financial services industry and result in credit downgrades of the banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts, credit and banking transactions, and deposit services, or cause them to default on their obligations. there is uncertainty regarding how proposed, contemplated or future changes to the complex laws and regulations governing our industry, the banking and financial services industry, and the economy could affect our business. in addition, economic conditions could deteriorate in the future, and, in particular, the semiconductor and electronics industries could fail to grow, including as the result of any disruption of international trade relationships. in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers, the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model. any of the foregoing could cause adverse effects on our business, operating results and financial condition, and could cause our stock price to decline.
our operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect our stock price.
our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations, which may adversely affect our stock price. our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations.
many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate, including:
•   changes in demand for our products-especially products, such as hardware, generating upfront revenue-due to fluctuations in demand for our customers' products and due to constraints in our customers' budgets for research and development and eda products and services;
•   product competition in the eda industry, which can change rapidly due to industry or customer consolidation and technological innovation;
•   our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services or effectively integrate products and technologies that we acquire;
•   failures or delays in completing sales due to our lengthy sales cycle, which often includes a substantial customer evaluation and approval process because of the complexity of our products and services;
•   our ability to implement effective cost control measures;
•   our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us, for a large portion of our revenue;
•   changes to the amount, composition and valuation of, and any impairments to or write-offs of, our inventory;
•   changes in the mix of our products sold, as increased sales of our products with lower gross margins, such as our hardware products, may reduce our overall margins;
•   expenses related to our acquisition and integration of businesses and technology;
•   changes in tax rules, as well as changes to our effective tax rate, including the tax effects of infrequent or unusual transactions and tax audit settlements;
•   delays, increased costs or quality issues resulting from our reliance on third parties to manufacture our hardware products, which includes a sole supplier for certain hardware components;
•   natural variability in the timing of ip drawdowns, which can be difficult to predict;
•   general economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics industries, such as disruptions to international trade relationships, including tariffs, export licenses, or other trade barriers affecting our or our suppliers' products; and
•   changes in accounting standards, which may impact the way we recognize our revenue and costs and impact our earnings.
the timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate. the timing of revenue recognition is affected by factors that include:
•   cancellations or changes in levels of orders or the mix between upfront products revenue and time-based products revenue;
•   delay of one or more orders for a particular period, particularly orders generating upfront products revenue, such as hardware;
•   delay in the completion of professional services projects that require significant modification or customization and are accounted for using the percentage of completion method;
•   delay in the completion and delivery of ip products in development as to which customers have paid for early access;
•   customer contract amendments or renewals that provide discounts or defer revenue to later periods;
•   the levels of our hardware and ip revenues, which are recognized upfront and are primarily dependent upon our ability to provide the latest technology and meet customer requirements; and
•   changes in our revenue recognition model.
these factors, or any other factors or risks discussed herein, could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline. additionally, our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock, which could cause our stock price to decline. our stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile, which may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares at a time or a price that is favorable to them.
we operate in highly competitive industries, and if we do not continue to meet our customers' demand for innovative technology at lower costs, our products may become uncompetitive and obsolete, and our business and financial condition may be harmed.
in our semiconductor & system design segment, we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services, such as cadence design systems, inc. and mentor graphics corporation (now part of siemens ag). we also compete with other eda vendors, including new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process. moreover, our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products, including internal designs that compete with our ip products. in the area of ip products, we compete against numerous other ip providers as well as our customers' internally developed ip.
in our software integrity segment, we compete with numerous other solution providers, many of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis. we also compete with frequent new entrants, which include start-up companies and more established software companies.
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors, including demand for our customers' products, design starts and our customers' budgetary constraints. technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements as well as changes in industry standards and customer requirements. semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing. at the same time, our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design, which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor. in order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our customers' technology requirements and increase the value of our products, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs.
we compete principally on the basis of technology, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license or usage terms, post-contract customer support, interoperability among products, and price and payment terms. specifically, we believe the following competitive factors affect our success:
•   our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles and technological shifts, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing software and hardware products, and successfully develop or acquire such new products;
•   our ability to offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance;
•   our ability to enhance the value of our offerings through more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights, price discounts and other differentiating rights, such as multiple tool copies, post-contract customer support, "re-mix" rights that allow customers to exchange the software they initially licensed for other synopsys products, and the ability to purchase pools of technology;
•   our ability to compete on the basis of payment terms; and
•   our ability to provide engineering and design consulting for our products.
if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors, fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs, or fail to address new competitive forces, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.
cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation, particularly that of our security testing solutions.
we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and confidential employee information, in our data centers and on our networks. despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information.
for example, we discovered unauthorized third-party access to our products and product license files hosted on our solvnet customer license and product delivery system in 2015. we determined that no customer project or design data had been accessed. no personally identifiable information or payment card information is stored on the system. while we identified and closed the method used to gain access, it is possible that our security measures may be circumvented again in the future, and such a breach could harm our business and reputation. the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. furthermore, in the operation of our business we also use third-party vendors that store certain sensitive data, including confidential information about our employees, and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats. while our standard vendor terms and conditions include provisions requiring the use of appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our data, as well as other safeguards, a breach may still occur. any security breach of our own or a third-party vendor's systems could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business.
our software products, including our hosted solutions as well as our software security and quality testing solutions, may also be vulnerable to cyber attacks. an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software, cause errors in the output of our customers' work, allow unauthorized access to our or our customers' proprietary information, and other destructive outcomes. as a result, our reputation could suffer, customers could stop buying our products, we could face lawsuits and potential liability, and our financial performance could be negatively impacted.
we offer software security and quality testing solutions. if we fail to identify new and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyber attacks, or fail to invest sufficient resources in research and development regarding new threat vectors, our security testing products and services may fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers' software code. an actual or perceived failure to identify security flaws may harm the perceived reliability of our security testing products and services, and could result in a loss of customers or sales, or an increased cost to remedy a problem. furthermore, our growth and recent acquisitions in the software security and quality testing space may increase our visibility as a security-focused company and may make us a more attractive target for attacks on our own information technology infrastructure. successful attacks could damage our reputation as a security-focused company.
if we fail to protect our proprietary technology, our business will be harmed.
our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful. we rely on agreements with customers, employees and other third-parties as well as intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology. these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. additionally, despite our measures to prevent piracy, other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products, which could result in lost revenue. some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. our trade secrets may also be stolen, otherwise become known, or be independently developed by competitors.
we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to:
•   assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property;
•   defend our products from piracy;
•   protect our trade secrets or know-how; or
•   determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of others.
if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions, our business and operating results would be harmed. in addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income.
we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.
acquisitions and strategic investments are an important part of our growth strategy. we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years. we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future, but we may not find suitable acquisition or investment targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions or investments due to unfavorable credit markets, commercially unacceptable terms, or other risks, which could harm our operating results. acquisitions and strategic investments are difficult, time-consuming, and pose a number of risks, including:
•   potential negative impact on our earnings per share;
•   failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales;
•   problems in integrating the acquired products with our products;
•   difficulties entering into new markets in which we are not experienced or where competitors may have stronger positions;
•   potential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses, increased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products;
•   difficulties in retaining and integrating key employees;
•   substantial reductions of our cash resources and/or the incurrence of debt;
•   failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings;
•   difficulties in integrating or expanding sales, marketing and distribution functions and administrative systems, including information technology and human resources systems;
•   dilution of our current stockholders through the issuance of common stock as part of the merger consideration;
•   difficulties in negotiating, governing and realizing value from strategic investments;
•   assumption of unknown liabilities, including tax and litigation, and the related expenses and diversion of resources;
•   disruption of ongoing business operations, including diversion of management's attention and uncertainty for employees and customers, particularly during the post-acquisition integration process;
•   potential negative impacts on our relationships with customers, distributors and business partners;
•   exposure to new operational risks, regulations, and business customs to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where we are not currently conducting business;
•   the need to implement controls, processes and policies appropriate for a public company at acquired companies that may have lacked such controls, processes and policies;
•   negative impact on our net income resulting from acquisition or investment-related costs; and
•   requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of an acquisition, including required divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business.
if we do not manage the foregoing risks, the acquisitions or strategic investments that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
we pursue new product and technology initiatives from time to time, and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely impacted.
as part of the evolution of our business, we have made substantial investments to develop new products and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and research and development efforts. if we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if we fail to introduce products that meet market demand, we may lose our competitive position, our products may become obsolete, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.
additionally, from time to time, we invest in expansion into adjacent markets, including software security and quality testing solutions. although we believe these solutions are complementary to our eda tools, we have less experience and a more limited operating history in offering software quality testing and security products and services, and our efforts in this area may not be successful. our success in these new markets depends on a variety of factors, including the following:
•   our ability to attract a new customer base, including in industries in which we have less experience;
•   our successful development of new sales and marketing strategies to meet customer requirements;
•   our ability to accurately predict, prepare for, and promptly respond to technological developments in new fields, including, in the case of our software quality testing and security tools and services, identifying new security vulnerabilities in software code and ensuring support for a growing number of programming languages;
•   our ability to compete with new and existing competitors in these new industries, many of which may have more financial resources, industry experience, brand recognition, relevant intellectual property rights, or established customer relationships than we currently do, and could include free and open source solutions that provide similar software quality testing and security tools without fees;
•   our ability to skillfully balance our investment in adjacent markets with investment in our existing products and services;
•   our ability to attract and retain employees with expertise in new fields;
•   our ability to sell and support consulting services at profitable margins; and
•   our ability to manage our revenue model in connection with hybrid sales of licensed products and consulting services.
difficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results.
we devote substantial resources to research and development. new competitors, technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors, our acquisitions, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. additionally, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact our financial results. finally, there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create additional revenue.
product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share.
software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released, or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. product errors, including those resulting from third-party suppliers, could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. in addition, any allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers' willingness to license ip products from us. any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.
our hardware products, which primarily consist of prototyping and emulation systems, subject us to distinct risks.
the growth in sales of our hardware products subjects us to several risks, including:
•   increased dependence on a sole supplier for certain hardware components, which may reduce our control over product quality and pricing and may lead to delays in production and delivery of our hardware products, should our supplier fail to deliver sufficient quantities of acceptable components in a timely fashion;
•   increasingly variable revenue and decreasingly accurate revenue forecasts, due to fluctuations in hardware revenue, which is recognized upfront upon shipment, as opposed to most sales of software products for which revenue is recognized over time;
•   potential reductions in overall margins, as the gross margin for our hardware products is typically lower than those of our software products;
•   longer sales cycles, which create risks of insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory valuation, which can adversely affect our operating results;
•   decreases or delays in customer purchases in favor of next-generation releases, which may lead to excess or obsolete inventory or require us to discount our older hardware products; and
•   longer warranty periods than those of our software products, which may require us to replace hardware components under warranty, thus increasing our costs.
changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) could adversely affect our financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes.
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap. these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board (fasb), the securities and exchange commission (sec) and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance.
the fasb periodically issues new accounting standards on a variety of topics, including, for example, revenue recognition and accounting for leases. for information regarding new accounting standards, please refer to note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading "effect of new accounting pronouncements." these and other such standards generally result in different accounting principles, which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in variability of our financial results. for example, the new revenue recognition standard became applicable to us at the beginning of fiscal 2019 and there is an increased volatility in our total revenue with less predictability than the prior accounting standard.
our results could be adversely affected by a change in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes and related new or revised guidance and regulations, changes in our geographical earnings mix, unfavorable government reviews of our tax returns, material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates, future changes to our tax structure, or by evolving enforcement practices.
our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions, with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary. because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix, including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing or from changes in the rules governing transfer pricing, could materially impact our effective tax rate. furthermore, a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense and impact our financial position and cash flows.
on december 22, 2017, the president of the united states signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act (tax act), which significantly changed prior u.s. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. the tax act includes certain new provisions that began to affect our income from foreign operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. the applicability and impact of these new tax provisions is dependent in part on changes to our tax structure that were implemented in response to the tax act at the end of fiscal 2018. the net impact of such changes is uncertain, and could adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years. since the beginning of fiscal 2019, the u.s. treasury department has issued proposed regulations that, if finalized as written, would have a material impact on our ability to claim certain tax benefits related to the tax act. while the company continues to evaluate the potential impact on its estimated annual tax rate, certain of these regulations have not been finalized and are subject to change. as additional regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may materially differ from previous estimates, and those differences may materially affect our financial position. accounting for certain of these provisions requires the exercise of significant judgment. as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may materially differ from previous estimates, and those differences may materially affect our financial position.
further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (beps) project undertaken by the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd), which represents a coalition of member countries. on october 5, 2015, the oecd issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. many of these recommendations are being adopted by various countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries. changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform, including future actions taken by foreign governments in response to the tax act, could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years.
our income and non-income tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we may also be liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire, including future taxes payable related to the transition tax on earnings from their foreign operations, if any, under the tax act. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the periods for which that determination is made.
in july 2017, the hungarian tax authority (hta) issued a final assessment against our hungarian subsidiary (synopsys hungary) for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. the hta has applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates, resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately $25.0 million and interest and penalties of $11.0 million. we paid the tax assessments, penalties and interest in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on our balance sheet. on april 30, 2019, the hungarian administrative court ruled against synopsys hungary. we filed an appeal with the hungarian supreme court on july 5, 2019. for further discussion of the hungary audit, see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading "non-u.s. examinations."
we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to certain tax credits. our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction and in the case of foreign tax credits, how such credits are treated under provisions of the tax act. changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results.
liquidity requirements in our u.s. operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets, which could negatively affect our financial condition.
as of october 31, 2019, approximately 74% of our worldwide cash and cash equivalents balance is held by our international subsidiaries. we intend to meet our u.s. cash spending needs, including the tax act provisional transition tax, primarily through our existing u.s. cash balances, ongoing u.s. cash flows, and available credit under our term loan and revolving credit facilities. should our cash spending needs in the u.s. rise and exceed these liquidity sources, we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, capital structure or the market price of our common stock.
from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third-party intellectual property rights.
we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights. under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party's intellectual property rights. infringement claims can result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, invalidate a patent or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could harm our business and operating results.
for example, we were engaged in complex patent litigation with mentor graphics corporation (mentor) involving several actions in different forums. in june 2018, we settled all outstanding patent litigation with mentor for a $65.0 million payment made in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to siemens, which acquired mentor in march 2017. further information regarding the lawsuits and settlement are contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings and note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading "legal proceedings." in conjunction with the settlement, we also amended an existing interoperability agreement with mentor to collaborate on a wide range of eda products. the amendment includes a one-time termination charge between $0.0 and $25.0 million, payable to mentor under certain conditions. in the event such conditions are met, the termination charge could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business.
we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, employment, customer, supplier, competition, and other issues on a global basis. litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products. if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. further information regarding certain of these matters is contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings.
we may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results.
we license third-party software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and, in several instances, for inclusion in our products. we also license third-party software, including the software of our competitors, to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our professional services. these licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time, or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future. third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology, or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors. if we are unable to obtain licenses to these third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to sell the affected products, our customers' use of the products may be interrupted, or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted, which could in turn harm our financial results, our customers, and our reputation.
the inclusion of third-party intellectual property in our products can also subject us and our customers to infringement claims. although we seek to mitigate this risk contractually, we may not be able to sufficiently limit our potential liability. regardless of outcome, infringement claims may require us to use significant resources and may divert management's attention.
some of our products and technology, including those we acquire, may include software licensed under open source licenses. some open source licenses could require us, under certain circumstances, to make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based on the open source software. although we have tools and processes to monitor and restrict our use of open source software, the risks associated with open source usage may not be eliminated and may, if not properly addressed, result in unanticipated obligations that harm our business.
if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees, our business may be harmed.
we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success. if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team, our business could be adversely affected. to be successful, we must also attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join us in connection with acquisitions. there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased. our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. any failure to recruit and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. additionally, efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses.
we issue equity awards from employee equity plans as a key component of our overall compensation. we face pressure to limit the use of such equity-based compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders. if we are unable to grant attractive equity-based packages in the future, it could limit our ability to attract and retain key employees.
our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.
we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the sec, the nasdaq stock market, and the fasb. these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. for example, our efforts to comply with the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other regulations, including "conflict minerals" regulations affecting our hardware products, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.
there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs.
regardless of how well designed and operated it is, a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. moreover, although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees, such measures may not prevent our employees, contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations. failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error, fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business.
our investment portfolio may be impaired by any deterioration of capital markets.
from time to time, our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio consists of investment-grade u.s. government agency securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, money market funds, municipal securities and other securities, and bank deposits. our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk. fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs. as a result of capital pressures on certain banks, especially in europe, and the continuing low interest rate environment, some of our financial instruments may become impaired.
our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be other-than-temporary. in addition, we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer's credit quality or changes in interest rates.
in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements, which, if not accurate, may significantly impact our financial results.
we make assumptions, judgments and estimates for a number of items, including the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill, long-lived assets and other intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets, the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards. we also make assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee-related liabilities, including commissions and variable compensation, and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, allowances for doubtful accounts, and legal contingencies. these assumptions, judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results could differ materially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results.
catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results.
due to the global nature of our business, our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world. we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications, enterprise applications and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack, terrorist attack, epidemic, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders. moreover, our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in california, near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results would be adversely affected.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following overview of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item 7, the risk factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10-k and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto set forth in item 8 of this form 10-k. please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this form 10-k regarding forward-looking statements.
business summary synopsys, inc. provides products and services used across the entire silicon to software spectrum, from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to software developers seeking to ensure the security and quality of their code. we are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation (eda) software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits (ics), also known as chips. we also offer semiconductor intellectual property (ip) products, which are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves. we provide software and hardware used to validate the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them. to complement these offerings, we provide technical services and support to help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic systems. these products and services are part of our semiconductor & system design segment.
we are also a leading provider of software tools and services that improve the security and quality of software code in a wide variety of industries, including electronics, financial services, media, automotive, medicine, energy and industrials. these tools and services are part of our software integrity segment.
our eda and ip customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies. our solutions help these companies overcome the challenges of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while also helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs. while our products are an important part of our customers' development process, our sales could be affected based on their research and development budgets, and our customers' spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs.
our software integrity business delivers products and services that enable software developers to test their code - while it is being written - for known security vulnerabilities and quality defects, as well as testing for open source security vulnerabilities and license compliance. our software integrity customers are software developers across many industries, including, but also well beyond, the semiconductor and systems industries. our software integrity products and services form a platform that helps our customers build security into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain.
despite global economic uncertainty, we have consistently grown our revenue since 2005. we achieved these results because of our solid execution, leading technologies and strong customer relationships. we recognize our revenue for the software licenses over the arrangement period, which typically approximates three years. for discussion on our revenue recognition policy, please see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements. time-based revenue consists of time-based products, maintenance and service revenue. the revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. as a result, decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way.
our growth strategy is based on building on our leadership in our eda products, expanding and proliferating our ip offerings, and driving growth in the software security and quality market. as we continue to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market, for instance in the software security and quality space, and as hardware product sales grow, we expect to experience increased variability in our total revenue. in addition, due to our adoption of accounting standard codification 606 (asc 606), "revenue from contracts with customers", in the beginning of fiscal 2019, as further described in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements, the way in which we are required to account for certain types of arrangements has increased the variability in our total revenue from period to period. nevertheless, the accounting impact has not affected our cash generated from our business. based on our leading technologies, customer relationships, business model, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy, we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully.
business segments effective in fiscal 2019, we realigned our business to evaluate the results of our software integrity business separately from our traditional eda and semiconductor ip business. the chief operating decision makers (codms) now regularly review disaggregated information for the following two reportable segments: (1) semiconductor & system design, which includes eda tools, ip products, system integration solutions and other revenue categories, and (2) software integrity, which includes a comprehensive solution for building integrity-security, quality and compliance testing-into our customers' software development lifecycle and supply chain. our historical results have been recast to retrospectively reflect the change from one to two reportable segments.
as a result of the change in reporting structure, financial information provided to and used by the codms to assist in making operational decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance reflects consolidated financial information as well as revenue, adjusted operating income, and adjusted operating margin for the semiconductor & system design and software integrity segments, accompanied by disaggregated information relating to revenues by geographic region.
semiconductor & system design. this segment includes our advanced silicon design, verification products and services, and semiconductor ip portfolio, which encompasses products and services that serve companies primarily in the semiconductor and electronics industries. eda includes digital, custom ic design and field programmable gate array (fpga) design software, verification products, and manufacturing software products. designers use these products to automate the ic design process and to reduce errors. for ip, we are a leading provider of high-quality, silicon-proven ip solutions for system-on-chips (socs). this includes ip that has been optimized to address specific application requirements for the mobile, automotive, digital home, internet of things, and cloud computing markets, enabling designers to quickly develop socs in these areas.
software integrity. this segment includes a broad portfolio of products and services such as leading quality testing technologies, automated analysis, and consulting experts. beginning in fiscal 2019, we launched the polaris software integrity platformtm, an integrated cloud-based solution that unites key elements to provide an even more valuable way for developers to better develop personalized approaches for open source license compliance and detect and remediate known security vulnerabilities and quality defects early in the development process, thereby minimizing risk and maximizing productivity.
fiscal year end our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to october 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception that approximately every five years, we have a 53-week year. when a 53-week year occurs, we include the additional week in the first quarter to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. fiscal 2018 was a 53-week year and ended on november 3, 2018. fiscal 2019 and 2017 were 52-week years ending on november 2, 2019 and october 28, 2017, respectively. fiscal 2020 will be a 52-week year.
for presentation purposes, this form 10-k refers to the closest calendar month end.
fiscal 2019 financial performance summary we adopted new revenue guidance, asc 606, at the beginning of fiscal 2019 under the modified retrospective method which has limited the comparability of prior year results in revenue and commission expense. the comparative information for periods prior to fiscal 2019 has not been restated. additional comparative information is provided in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the adoption of asc 606 and our pro-forma financial results under accounting standards codification 605 (asc 605), "revenue recognition", for fiscal 2019.
in fiscal 2019, compared to fiscal 2018, our financial performance reflects the following:
•   revenues were $3.4 billion, an increase of $239.6 million or 8%, primarily due to our continued growth organically, as well as the adoption of asc 606, partially offset by additional revenue of approximately $46.0 million due to the extra week in fiscal 2018;
•   total cost of revenue and operating expenses were $2.8 billion, an increase of $79.6 million or 3%, primarily due to increases in restructuring costs of $34.2 million and employee-related costs of $81.3 million, resulting from increases in headcount, partially offset by a litigation settlement in fiscal 2018 of $26.0 million and a legal settlement in our favor in fiscal 2019 of $18.3 million;
•   operating income of $520.2 million, an increase of $160.0 million or 44%.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial results under results of operations below are based on our audited results of operations, which we have prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. in preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and net income. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. our actual results may differ from these estimates. see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our significant accounting policies.
the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:
•   revenue recognition;
•   valuation of business combinations; and
•   income taxes.
revenue recognition our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. determining whether services and products are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. we have concluded that our eda software licenses in tsl contracts are not distinct from our obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because those promises represent inputs to a single, combined performance obligation. where unspecified additional software product rights are part of the contract with the customer, those rights are accounted for as part of the single performance obligation that includes the licenses, updates, and technical support, because such rights are provided during the same period of time and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. in reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our obligation to customers which is to provide an ongoing right to use the most up to date and relevant software. as eda customers operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment, satisfying the obligation requires providing critical updates to the existing software products, including ongoing iterative interaction with customers to make the software relevant to the customers' ability to meet the time to go to market with advanced products.
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets. although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include, but are not limited to:
•   future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;
•   historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;
•   the expected use of the acquired assets; and
•   discount rates.
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. in addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. in addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the u.s. internal revenue service (irs) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. we believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.
effect of new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
results of operations we adopted new revenue guidance, asc 606, at the beginning of fiscal 2019 under the modified retrospective method which has limited the comparability of prior year results in revenue and commission expense. the comparative information for periods prior to the fiscal 2019 has not been restated. additional comparative information is provided in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the adoption of asc 606 and our pro-forma financial results under asc 605 for fiscal 2019.
revenue our revenues are generated from two business segments: the semiconductor & system design segment and the software integrity segment. see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments and revenue by geographic regions.
further disaggregation of the revenues into various products and services within these two segments is summarized as follows:
semiconductor & system design segment this segment is comprised of the following:
•   eda software includes digital, custom and field programmable gate array (fpga) ic design software, verification products and obligations to provide unspecified updates and support services. eda products and services are typically sold through tsl arrangements that grant customers the right to access and use all of the licensed products at the outset of an arrangement and software updates are generally made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement. the weighted-average term of the tsls we entered into in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 were all 2.7 years, respectively. under asc 606, we have concluded that the software licenses in tsl contracts are not distinct from the obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because the multiple software licenses represent inputs to a single, combined offering, and timely, relevant software updates are integral to maintaining the utility of the software licenses. we recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation under tsl contracts ratably over the term of the license. under asc 605, these arrangements were previously recognized ratably over the contract term.
•   ip &amp; system integration includes our designware® ip portfolio and system-level products and services. under asc 606, these arrangements generally have two performance obligations which consist of transferring of the licensed ip and providing related support, which includes rights to technical support and software updates that are provided over the support term and are transferred to the customer over a time. revenue allocated to the ip licenses is recognized at a point in time upon the later of the delivery date or the beginning of the license period, and revenue allocated to support is recognized over the support term. royalties are recognized as revenue in the quarter in which the applicable customer sells its products that incorporate our ip. payments for ip contracts are generally received upon delivery of the ip. revenue related to the customization of certain ip is recognized as "professional services." under asc 605, we previously recognized revenues ratably for certain ip licensing and support arrangements.
•   in the case of arrangements involving the sale of hardware products, we generally have two performance obligations. the first performance obligation is to transfer the hardware product, which includes software integral to the functionality of the hardware product. the second performance obligation is to provide maintenance on the hardware and its embedded software, which includes rights to technical support, hardware repairs and software updates that are all provided over the same term and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. the portion of the transaction price allocated to the hardware product is generally recognized as revenue at the time of delivery because the customer obtains control of the product at that point in time. we have concluded that control generally transfers at that point in time because the customer has title to the hardware, physical possession, and a present obligation to pay for the hardware. the portion of the transaction price allocated to the maintenance obligation is recognized as revenue ratably over the maintenance term. the adoption of asc 606 did not change the timing of revenue recognition for hardware products.
•   revenue from professional service contracts is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. we have a history of reasonably estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. a number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. the adoption of asc 606 did not change from asc 605 the timing of revenue recognition for professional services.
software integrity segment
•   we sell software integrity products in arrangements that provide customers the right to software licenses, maintenance updates and technical support. over the term of these arrangements, the customer expects us to provide integral maintenance updates to the software licenses, which help customers protect their own software from new critical quality defects and potential security vulnerabilities. the licenses and maintenance updates serve together to fulfill our commitment to the customer as both work together to provide the functionality to the customer and represent a combined performance obligation. we will recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation over the term of the arrangement.
most of our customer arrangements are complex, involving hundreds of products and various license rights, and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements. for example, they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. no single factor typically drives our customers' buying decisions, and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in highly competitive markets. customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes.

the overall growth of our business has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue. our revenues are subject to fluctuations, primarily due to customer requirements, including the timing and value of contract renewals, as well as payment terms for revenue recognized under asc 605. for example, we experience variability in our revenue due to factors such as the timing of ip consulting projects, royalties, variability in ip products sales and hardware sales. as revenue from ip products sales and hardware sales are recognized upfront, customer demand and timing requirements for such ip products and hardware have resulted in increased variability of our total revenue.
the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to the continued business growth in all product categories, and higher revenue of $102.5 million recognized under new revenue standard asc 606 compared with revenue recognized under old revenue standard asc 605. the increase was partially offset by approximately $46.0 million of additional revenue due to one extra week in fiscal 2018.
33
the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to the continued overall growth of our business, mainly due to higher tsl license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods, an increase in professional services, additional revenue of approximately $46.0 million due to an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, and contributions from acquired companies.

the increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the sale of ip products driven by higher demand from customers and higher ip revenue recognized upfront under asc 606 of $235.4 million.
the increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of ip products driven by higher demand from customers.
upfront products revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likely fluctuate based on the timing of ip products and hardware sales. such fluctuations will continue to be impacted by the timing of shipments due to customer requirements.

we divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of products revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets. we segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of products revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and post-customer contract support services. we then allocate these group costs between cost of products revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on products and maintenance and service revenue reported.
cost of products revenue. cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed, allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs, royalties paid to third-party vendors, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that had reached technological feasibility.

cost of maintenance and service revenue. cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and costs to deliver our consulting services, such as hotline and on-site support, production services and documentation of maintenance updates. we expect our cost of maintenance and service revenue to increase in future periods because of recent acquisitions, but we do not expect the impact to be material to our total cost of revenue.
amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets, which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses, includes the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete related to acquisitions and certain contract rights related to acquisitions.

the net decrease in other income (expense) in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to lower gains in the market value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets and higher interest expense due to a higher debt balance.
segment operating results we do not allocate certain operating expenses managed at a consolidated level to our reportable segments. these unallocated expenses consist primarily of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, litigation and acquisition-related costs. see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.

income taxes the tax cuts and jobs act (tax act), enacted on december 22, 2017, lowered the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective on january 1, 2018. beginning in fiscal 2019, our annual statutory federal corporate tax rate is 21%.
our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 2.4%, which included a tax benefit of $28.1 million related to the realizability of u.s. foreign tax credits related to the transfer of intangibles associated with the tax restructuring in fiscal 2018, a u.s. federal research tax credit of $34.5 million, a foreign derived intangible income deduction (fdii) of $26.6 million, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $40.5 million.
our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was (19.0%), which included a tax benefit of $172.0 million relating to the restructuring of our foreign intellectual property rights, a u.s. federal research tax credit of $35.1 million, a settlement with the internal revenue service (irs) of $21.8 million tax benefit for fiscal 2017, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $31.0 million. these benefits were partially offset by tax expense of $63.1 million for a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings, $51.1 million due to re-measurement of u.s. deferred tax assets as a result of the tax act, and tax expense related to the integration of acquired technologies of $27.9 million.
our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 64.4%, which included income tax expense of $166.2 million relating to a repatriation of foreign earnings of $825 million, $30.5 million due to an increase in valuation allowance on state deferred tax assets, a settlement with the korean national tax service for the audit of fiscal years 2012 to 2016 of $7.9 million, and tax expense related to the integration of acquired technologies of $36.4 million. these expenses were partially offset by excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $38.1 million, a u.s. federal research tax credit of $25.5 million, and a settlement with the taiwanese tax authorities for fiscal 2014 of $10.9 million.
the integration of acquired technologies represents the income tax effect resulting from the transfer of certain intangible assets among company-controlled entities. these intangible assets generally result from the acquisition of technology by a company-controlled entity as part of a business or asset acquisition.
the tax act required us to pay a one-time transition tax on previously untaxed earnings represented by foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining earnings. in fiscal 2018, we recorded a tax expense of $63.1 million. based on subsequent judicial rulings in fiscal 2019 (including altera corp. et al. v. commissioner and the hungarian administrative court ruling, we recorded a tax benefit of $17.9 million related to the one-time transition tax. see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements or further discussion.
we continue to obtain, analyze and interpret additional guidance issued related to the tax act. the applicability and impact of the following new tax provisions are dependent in part on forthcoming irs guidance.
39
•   a tax on global intangible low-tax income (gilti), which is determined annually based on our aggregate foreign subsidiaries' income in excess of certain qualified business asset investment return. in fiscal 2019, the company adopted an accounting policy to account for the tax effects of gilti in the period that it is subject to such tax.
•   a base erosion and anti-abuse tax (beat), which functions as a minimum tax that partially disallows deductions for certain related party transactions and certain tax credits.
•   a special tax deduction for fdii, which, in general, allows a deduction of certain intangible income earned in the u.s. and derived from foreign sources.
the tax act also provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after december 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time transition tax. we have provided for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.
in july 2017, the hungarian tax authority (the hta) issued a final assessment against our hungarian subsidiary (synopsys hungary) for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. the hta has applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates, resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately $25.0 million and interest and penalties of $11.0 million. we paid the tax assessments, penalties and interest in the first quarter of 2018 as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on our balance sheet. on april 30, 2019, the hungarian administrative court ruled against synopsys hungary. we filed an appeal with the hungarian supreme court on july 5, 2019.
see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the provision for income taxes, the impacts related to the tax act, and the hungarian audit.
liquidity and capital resources our sources of cash and cash equivalents are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities.
as of october 31, 2019, we held an aggregate of $191.6 million in cash and cash equivalents in the united states and an aggregate of $537.0 million in our foreign subsidiaries. as a result of the tax act, if we decide to repatriate the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for use in the u.s. in the future, the earnings made after december 31, 2017 would not be subject to further u.s. tax. in addition, we have provided foreign deferred taxes on our undistributed earnings of $6.3 million in fiscal 2019, which is sufficient to address the incremental tax that would be due on future foreign earnings.
the following sections discuss changes in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flow, and other commitments of our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2019.

cash and cash equivalents increased primarily due to cash from our operations and net proceeds from our credit facilities. the increase in cash and cash equivalents was partially offset by repayment of debt, stock repurchases, annual variable compensation payouts, and purchases of property and equipment.

cash provided by operating activities we expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, our operating results, and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments. cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. we generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from time-based products revenue, in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license.
fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher net income and higher cash collections, partially offset by higher disbursements for operations, including vendors.
fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher vendor disbursements, higher income taxes payment, higher accounts receivable due to timing of customer billings, and higher inventory. disbursements in fiscal 2018 included certain one-time payments of $163.3 million for income taxes and $65.0 million for a litigation settlement.
cash used in investing activities fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher cash paid for acquisitions in fiscal 2018 of $616.0 million.
fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher cash paid for acquisitions of $393.4 million and lower proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases, of $128.1 million.
cash provided by (used in) financing activities fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. cash used in financing activities was higher primarily due to higher debt repayments of $228.8 million and lower proceeds from credit facilities drawdowns of $427.7 million.
fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. cash provided by financing activities was higher primarily due to higher proceeds of $300.6 million from drawdowns of our credit facilities and lower debt repayment of $85.3 million.

working capital (deficit)   $(13.6        )           $(558.6       )        $545.0             (98   )%
increases in our working capital were primarily due to a decrease in short-term debt of $326.2 million, an increase in prepaid and other current assets of $222.5 million, and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $71.9 million, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 million.
other commitments - credit and term loan facilities in july 2018, we entered into a 220.0 million rmb (approximately $33.0 million) credit agreement with a lender in china to support our facilities expansion. borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the chinese central bank rate plus 10% of such rate. as of october 31, 2019, we had $17.9 million outstanding under the agreement.
on november 28, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with several lenders (the credit agreement) providing for (i) a $650.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the revolver) and (ii) a $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the term loan). the credit agreement amended and restated our previous credit agreement dated may 19, 2015, in order to increase the size of the revolving credit facility from $500.0 million to $650.0 million, provide a new $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility, and extend the termination date of the revolving credit facility from may 19, 2020 to november 28, 2021. subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders, the principal amount of the loans provided under the credit agreement may be increased by us by up to an additional $150.0 million. the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio, as well as other non-financial covenants. as of october 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all financial covenants.
as of october 31, 2019, we had $119.8 million outstanding balance, net of debt issuance costs, under the term loan, of which $102.2 million was classified as long-term liabilities. outstanding principal payments under the term loan are due as follows:
fiscal year       (in thousands)
2020       $17,813
2021        27,187
2022        75,000
total      $120,000
as of october 31, 2018, we had $133.8 million outstanding balance, net of debt issuance costs, under the term loan, of which $120.0 million was classified as long-term liabilities. the total outstanding balance under the revolver as of october 31, 2018 was $330.0 million, which was included in short-term liabilities.
there was no outstanding balance under the revolver as of october 31, 2019. we expect our borrowings under the revolver will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the credit agreement. as of october 31, 2019, borrowings under the term loan bore interest at libor +1.125% and the applicable interest rate for the revolver was libor +1.000%. in addition, commitment fees are payable on the revolver at rates between 0.125% and 0.200% per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment.
subsequent to fiscal year 2019, we drew down $160.0 million under the revolver. the total outstanding balance of the revolver as of december 20, 2019 is $160.0 million, net of repayments.
other as of october 31, 2019, our cash equivalents consisted of taxable money market mutual funds. we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk.
we proactively manage our cash equivalents balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity. additionally, we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our global excess cash, and our cash equivalents, invested in banks and securities with a weighted-average
42
credit rating exceeding aa. the majority of our investments are classified as level 1 or level 2 investments, as measured under fair value guidance. see notes 5 and 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and available credit under our revolver will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.

(2)   purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of october 31, 2019. although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.
(3)   these commitments relate to the principal of the term loan and a credit facility as discussed in other commitments above.
(4)   these other obligations include fees associated with our credit facility.
(5)   long-term accrued income taxes represent uncertain tax benefits as of october 31, 2019. currently, a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments related to uncertain tax benefits in individual years beyond fiscal 2019 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits.
the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of october 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k.

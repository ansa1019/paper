item 1a.    risk factors this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, section 21e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. also, documents that we "incorporate by reference" into this annual report on form 10-k, including documents that we subsequently file with the sec will contain forward-looking statements. when we refer to forward-looking statements or information, sometimes we use words such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "plans," "intends," "expects," "believes," "estimates," "anticipates" and "continues." in particular, the below risk factors describe forward-looking information. the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not all-inclusive, particularly with respect to possible future events. many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe. these factors include, but are not limited to the following:
risk factors related to our real estate investments and operations revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful.
revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis. some of our leases provide for the payment, in addition to base rent, of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property. economic, legal, and/or competitive conditions may impact the success of our tenants' retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants. any reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent, or other charges on a timely basis, including the closing of stores prior to the end of the lease term or the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection, will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. in the event of default by a tenant, we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms, which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our "anchor" tenants.
our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business, or the bankruptcy or insolvency, of any anchor store or anchor tenant. anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage, pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property. the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by, or reductions in rent from, other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result. we continue to see higher levels of anchor turnover and closings in some markets, which has caused an oversupply of larger retail spaces. therefore, tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result, we may see an increase in vacancy and/or a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income. as of december 31, 2019, our anchor tenant space is 97.5% leased and 95.9% occupied.
a shift in retail shopping from brick and mortar stores to online shopping may have an adverse impact on our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.
many retailers operating brick and mortar stores have made online sales a vital piece of their business.  the shift to online shopping may cause declines in brick and mortar sales generated by certain of our tenants and may cause certain of our tenants to reduce the size or number of their retail locations in the future. this risk is partially mitigated by our strategy of maintaining a diverse portfolio of retail properties. the trend of retailers utilizing brick and mortar locations for 'showroom' and on-line sales distribution purposes (particularly at shopping centers in densely populated areas like ours) may further mitigate this risk. however, there can be no assurance that our shopping centers will not be further impacted by the shift to online shopping.  as a result, our cash flow, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
we have properties that are geographically concentrated, and adverse economic or real estate market declines in these areas could have a material adverse effect on us.
as of december 31, 2019, our tenants operated in 12 states and the district of columbia. any adverse situation that disproportionately affects the the markets where our properties are concentrated may have a magnified adverse effect on our portfolio. refer to "properties" (item 2 of this annual report on form 10-k) for additional discussion of the geographic concentration. real estate markets are subject to economic downturns, as they have been in the past, and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in both the short and long term.
8
declines in the economy or a decline in the real estate market in these states could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties. factors that may negatively affect economic conditions in these states include:
•   business layoffs or downsizing;
•   industry slowdowns;
•   relocations of businesses;
•   changing demographics;
•   increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places;
•   infrastructure quality;
•   any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate;
•   concessions or reduced rental rates under new leases for properties where tenants defaulted; and
•   increased operating costs including insurance premiums and real estate taxes.
we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection.
if a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy, we may not be able to collect all pre-petition amounts owed by that party. in addition, a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or re-leasing space.
we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants. we are subject to the risks that, upon expiration or termination of leases, whether by their terms, as a result of a tenant bankruptcy, general economic conditions or otherwise, leases for space in our properties may not be renewed, space may not be re-leased, or the terms of renewal or re-lease, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than current lease terms and may include decreases in rental rates. as a result, our net income could be reduced.
our development activities have inherent risks.
the ground-up development of improvements on real property, as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements, presents substantial risks. we generally do not look to acquire raw land for future development; however, we do intend to complete the development and construction of future phases of projects we already own. we may undertake development of these and other projects on our own or bring in third parties if it is justifiable on a risk-adjusted return basis. we may also choose to delay completion of a project if market conditions do not allow an appropriate return. if conditions arise and we are not able or decide not to complete a project or if the expected cash flows of our project do not exceed the book value, an impairment of the project may be required. if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful, it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
during 2019, construction was substantially completed on the development of phase ii at both assembly row and pike & rose, with portions of both projects opening during 2018 and 2019. additionally, we continued construction on phase iii at both projects, and our on-going redevelopment efforts at santana row. a further discussion of these projects, expected costs, and current status can be found in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the "outlook" subsection.
in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general, as described elsewhere and the specific risks above, the risks associated with our remaining development activities include:
•   contractor changes may delay the completion of development projects and increase overall costs;
•   significant time lag between commencement and stabilization subjects us to greater risks due to fluctuations in the general economy;
•   delivery of residential product into uncertain residential environments may result in lower rents or longer time periods to reach economic stabilization;
•   substantial amount of our investment is related to infrastructure and the overall value of the project may be negatively impacted if we do not complete subsequent phases;
•   failure or inability to obtain construction or permanent financing on favorable terms;
•   expenditure of money and time on projects that may never be completed;
•   difficulty securing key anchor or other tenants may impact occupancy rates and projected revenue;
•   inability to achieve projected rental rates or anticipated pace of lease-up;
•   higher than estimated construction or operating costs, including labor and material costs; and
9
•   possible delay in completion of a project because of a number of factors, including weather, labor disruptions, construction delays or delays in receipt of zoning or other regulatory approvals, acts of terror or other acts of violence, or acts of god (such as fires, earthquakes or floods).
redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected.
our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of high quality, retail focused properties in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply. the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entail risks that include the following, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations:
•   our estimate of the costs to improve, reposition or redevelop a property may prove to be too low, or the time we estimate to complete the improvement, repositioning or redevelopment may be too short. as a result, the property may fail to achieve the returns we have projected, either temporarily or for a longer period;
•   we may not be able to identify suitable properties to acquire or may be unable to complete the acquisition of the properties we identify;
•   we may not be able to integrate an acquisition into our existing operations successfully;
•   properties we redevelop or acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project, within the time frames we project, at the time we make the decision to invest, which may result in the properties' failure to achieve the returns we projected;
•   our pre-acquisition evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment may not detect certain defects or identify necessary repairs until after the property is acquired, which could significantly increase our total acquisition costs or decrease cash flow from the property; and
•   our investigation of a property or building prior to our acquisition, and any representations we may receive from the seller of such building or property, may fail to reveal various liabilities, which could reduce the cash flow from the property or increase our acquisition cost.
our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry.
our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently, the value of our investments, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected. as a real estate company, we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks:
•   economic downturns in general, or in the areas where our properties are located;
•   adverse changes in local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply or reduction in demand;
•   changes in tenant preferences that reduce the attractiveness of our properties to tenants;
•   zoning or regulatory restrictions;
•   decreases in market rental rates;
•   weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weather-related expenses;
•   costs associated with the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-lease space; and
•   increases in the cost of adequate maintenance, insurance and other operating costs, including real estate taxes, associated with one or more properties, which may occur even when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in revenues from one or more properties, although real estate taxes typically do not increase upon a reduction in such revenues.
each of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.
many real estate costs are fixed, even if income from our properties decreases.
our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us. costs associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied, rental rates decrease, or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. as a result, cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms. under those circumstances, we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs. additionally, new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately, and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully occupied.
10
competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants.
numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition. this competition may:
•   reduce properties available for acquisition;
•   increase the cost of properties available for acquisition;
•   reduce rents payable to us;
•   interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants;
•   lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties; and
•   adversely affect our ability to minimize expenses of operation.
retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers, outlet stores, discount shopping clubs and other forms of sales and marketing of goods, such as direct mail. this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants. if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties, or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets, it could materially affect our ability to generate net income, service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders.
we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid.
real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. in addition, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets. we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the economic environment. our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders.
we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments.
our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets owned jointly with other persons or entities. as of december 31, 2019, we held 16 predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons in addition to properties owned in a "downreit" structure. additionally, we own an interest in the joint ventures that own the hotel components of pike & rose and assembly row. we may make additional joint investments in the future. our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks, including the possibility that our partners or co-investors might become bankrupt, that those partners or co-investors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals, that those partners or co-investors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions, or in opposition to our policies or objectives, and that disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture, which may result in litigation or arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution. although as of december 31, 2019, we held the controlling interests in all of our existing co-investments (except the hotel investments discussed above and the investment in the la alameda shopping center acquired in 2017), we generally must obtain the consent of the co-investor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties. joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. we may also be liable for the actions of our co-investors.
our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate.
we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties, including insurance for liability, fire, flood, earthquake, environmental matters, rental loss and acts of terrorism. all of these policies contain coverage limitations. we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located. we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties.
the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry and other factors outside our control. as a result, we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices. in addition, insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses, such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold, or, if offered, the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified. we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses and/or there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future. if
11
any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. also, due to inflation, changes in codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors, it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed. further, we may be unable to collect insurance proceeds if our insurers are unable to pay or contest a claim. events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations, including distributions to our shareholders.
natural disasters and climate change could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating results.
climate change may add to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and severe weather conditions and create additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. certain of our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, earthquakes, droughts, snow storms, floods and fires.  the impact of climate change or the occurrence of natural disasters can delay new development projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase operating costs, create additional investment costs to make improvements to existing properties to comply with climate change regulations, increase future property insurance costs, and negatively impact the tenant demand for space.  if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events, our earnings, liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected.
risk factors related to our funding strategies and capital structure the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
as of december 31, 2019, all of our $3.4 billion of debt outstanding has a fixed rate or is fixed via interest rate swap agreements. of that outstanding debt, approximately $547.2 million was secured by all or a portion of 13 of our real estate projects. our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur. the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders. for example, it could:
•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, property acquisitions, redevelopments and other appropriate business opportunities that may arise in the future;
•   limit our ability to make distributions on our outstanding common shares and preferred shares;
•   make it difficult to satisfy our debt service requirements;
•   require us to dedicate increased amounts of our cash flow from operations to payments on debt upon refinancing or on our variable rate, unhedged debt, if interest rates rise;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the factors that affect the profitability of our business;
•   limit our ability to obtain any additional debt or equity financing we may need in the future for working capital, debt refinancing, capital expenditures, acquisitions, redevelopments or other general corporate purposes or to obtain such financing on favorable terms; and/or
•   limit our flexibility in conducting our business, which may place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt or debt with less restrictive terms.
our ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance, which to a certain extent is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs. if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt, sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs, including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust. we cannot assure you that any such refinancing, sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable.
we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt agreements.
our revolving credit facility and certain series of notes include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future. we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include, among other things, provisions:
•   relating to the maintenance of property securing a mortgage;
•   restricting our ability to pledge assets or create liens;
12
•   restricting our ability to incur additional debt;
•   restricting our ability to amend or modify existing leases at properties securing a mortgage;
•   restricting our ability to enter into transactions with affiliates; and
•   restricting our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.
as of december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of our default related financial covenants. if we were to breach any of our default related debt covenants, including the covenants listed above, and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately, and, if the debt is secured, could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan. many of our debt arrangements, including our public notes and our revolving credit facility, are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations. as a result, any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares.
adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms.
our credit worthiness is rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. the credit ratings assigned are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, financial condition and prospects, and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general. our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we access, as well as the terms of certain existing and future financing we obtain. since we depend on debt financing to fund the growth of our business, an adverse change in our credit rating, including actual changes in outlook, or even the initiation of review of our credit rating that could result in an adverse change, could have a material adverse effect on us.
our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital.
our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties. we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because, in addition to other requirements, we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. debt could include the sale of debt securities and mortgage loans from third parties. if economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital, we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms. additionally, we cannot guarantee that additional financing, refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms. our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors, including the market's perception of our growth potential and risk profile, our ability to pay dividends, and our current and potential future earnings. depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment, we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms, or be unable to implement this strategy.
rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares.
of our $3.4 billion of debt outstanding as of december 31, 2019, approximately $56.5 million bears interest at a variable rate of libor plus 195.0 basis points and is effectively fixed through two interest rate swap agreements. we also have a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, on which no balance was outstanding at december 31, 2019, that bears interest at libor plus 77.5 basis points. we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future. increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow, which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders. we may enter into additional hedging arrangements or other transactions for all or a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates. however, the amounts we are required to pay under variable rate debt to which hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to any such hedging arrangements. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost and/or timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares.
the phase-out of libor could affect interest rates under our variable rate debt and interest rate swap arrangements.
libor is used as a reference rate for our revolving credit facility, certain mortgage payables, and in our interest rate swap arrangements. on july 27, 2017, the united kingdom's financial conduct authority announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021. it is unclear if libor will cease to exist at that time, if a new method of calculating libor will be established, or if an alternative reference rate will be established. the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york organized the alternative reference rates committee which identified the
13
secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") as its preferred alternative to u.s. dollar libor in derivatives and other financial contracts. we are not able to predict when libor will cease to be available or if sofr, or another alternative rate reference rate, attains market traction as a libor replacement. if libor ceases to exist, we will need to agree upon a benchmark replacement index with the bank, and as such the interest rate on our revolving credit facility and certain mortgage payables may change. the new rate may not be as favorable as those in effect prior to any libor phase-out. furthermore, the transition process may result in delays in funding, higher interest expense, additional expenses, and increased volatility in markets for instruments that currently rely on libor, all of which could negatively impact our cash flow.
we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit.
as a reit, we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90% of our taxable income. we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed taxable income and net capital gain. in addition, we would be subject to a 4% excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income, capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years. we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code's distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax. we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because:
•   our income may not be matched by our related expenses at the time the income is considered received for purposes of determining taxable income; and
•   non-deductible capital expenditures, creation of reserves, or debt service requirements may reduce available cash but not taxable income.
in these circumstances, we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive. current tax law also allows us to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash.
risk factors related to our company and the market price of our securities the market value of our debt and equity securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility.
as with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our debt and equity securities depends on various factors, which may change from time to time and/or may be unrelated to our financial condition, operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices. these factors include, among others:
•   general economic and financial market conditions;
•   level and trend of interest rates;
•   our ability to access the capital markets to raise additional capital;
•   the issuance of additional equity or debt securities;
•   changes in our funds from operations ("ffo") or earnings estimates;
•   changes in our credit or analyst ratings;
•   our financial condition and performance;
•   market perception of our business compared to other reits; and
•   market perception of reits, in general, compared to other investment alternatives.
we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates.
our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate, and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities, will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the following:
•   our financial condition and results of future operations;
•   the performance by our tenants under their contractual lease agreements;
•   the terms of our loan covenants; and
•   our ability to acquire, finance, develop or redevelop and lease additional properties at attractive rates.
if we do not maintain or increase the dividend on our common shares, it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities. any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares. conversely, payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer.
14
loss of our key management could adversely affect performance and the value of our common shares.
we are dependent on the efforts of our key management. although we believe qualified replacements could be found for any departures of key executives, the loss of their services could adversely affect our performance and the value of our common shares.
we may adjust our business policies without shareholder approval.
we may modify our approach to investment, financing, borrowing, and other operating strategies without shareholder approval. a change in the approach to any of these items could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and the market price of our securities.
our current business plan focuses on our investment in high quality retail based properties that are typically neighborhood and community shopping centers or mixed-use properties, principally through redevelopments and acquisitions. if this business plan is not successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements that we make, including those in this annual report on form 10-k. except as may be required by law, we make no promise to update any of the forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors.
we face risks relating to cyber attacks that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions.
we rely extensively on information technology systems to process transactions and manage our business, and our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cyber attacks. these could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and computer systems as well as attacks on third party's information technology systems that we rely on to provide important information technology services relating to key business functions, such as payroll. attacks can be both individual and/or highly organized attempts by very sophisticated hacking organizations. we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, which include password encryption, frequent password change events, firewall detection systems, anti-virus software in-place, frequent backups, a redundant data system for core applications and penetration testing; however, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber attack. a cyber attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees, tenants and vendors. a successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations.
risk factors related to our reit status and other laws and regulations environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties.
all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials, environmental protection and human health and safety. under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate, and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances. this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release. the presence of contamination or the failure to properly remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral. the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate. we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations taken as a whole. the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the property-specific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties. if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities, the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations.
we cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future. compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems. our tenants, like many of their competitors, have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations, which will adversely affect their potential profitability.
generally, our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements. our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant. if a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply, we could be
15
forced to pay these costs. if not addressed, environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or re-lease the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments.
the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties.
our existing properties, as well as properties we may acquire, as commercial facilities, are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990. investigation of a property may reveal non-compliance with this act. the requirements of this act, or of other federal, state or local laws or regulations, also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons. future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties.
the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal, state and local laws to which they are subject.
we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, such as local licensing requirements, consumer protection laws and state and local fire, life-safety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties. the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations. failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants, or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties. non-compliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant, could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any non-compliance, and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property.
failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions.
we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the code. however, we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future.
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code. certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit. for example, in order to qualify as a reit, at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income. satisfying this requirement could be difficult, for example, if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents. as a reit, we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90% of our taxable income. in addition, new legislation, new regulations, new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. any modification in the tax treatment of reits could have a significant adverse impact to our net income.
if we fail to qualify as a reit:
•   we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income;
•   we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;
•   unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified;
•   we could be required to pay significant income taxes, which would substantially reduce the funds available for investment or for distribution to our shareholders for each year in which we failed or were not permitted to qualify; and
•   we would no longer be required by law to make any distributions to our shareholders.
to maintain our status as a reit, we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own.
the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit. for example, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the code) during the last half of any taxable year. to protect our reit status, our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning (actually or constructively) more than 9.8% in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares. the constructive ownership rules are complex. shares of our capital stock owned, actually or constructively, by a group of related individuals and/or entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities. as a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% in value of the outstanding common shares and/or a class or series of preferred shares (or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity (or another) to own constructively more than 9.8% in value of the
16
outstanding capital stock. if that happened, either the transfer of ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 9.8% ownership limit.
the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a case-by-case basis. in addition, the board of trustees and two-thirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a reit. the 9.8% ownership restrictions may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders' best interest.
u.s. federal tax reform legislation now and in the future could affect reits, both positively and negatively, in ways that are difficult to anticipate.
the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "2017 tax act"), signed into law on december 22, 2017, represents sweeping tax reform legislation that makes significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes.  while we currently do not expect the 2017 tax act will have a significant direct impact on us, it may impact us indirectly as our tenants and the jurisdictions in which we do business as well as the overall investment thesis for reits may be impacted both positively and negatively in ways that are difficult to predict. additionally, the overall impact of the 2017 tax act depends on future interpretations and regulations that may be issued by federal tax authorities, as well as changes in state and local taxation in response to the 2017 tax act, and it is possible that such future interpretations, regulations and other changes could adversely impact us.
certain tax and anti-takeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control.
certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law, as applicable to maryland reits, may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us. if this were to happen, it could delay, deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management. these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over then-prevailing market prices. these provisions include:
•   the reit ownership limit described above;
•   authorization of the issuance of our preferred shares with powers, preferences or rights to be determined by the board of trustees;
•   special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, by one-third of the trustees or by shareholders possessing no less than 25% of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;
•   the board of trustees, without a shareholder vote, can classify or reclassify unissued shares of beneficial interest, including the reclassification of common shares into preferred shares and vice-versa;
•   a two-thirds shareholder vote is required to approve some amendments to the declaration of trust; and
•   advance-notice requirements for proposals to be presented at shareholder meetings.
in addition, if we elect to be governed by it in the future, the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control. under maryland law, unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law, "control shares" acquired in a "control share acquisition" have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit. "control shares" are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power. a "control share acquisition" means the acquisition of control shares, with some exceptions.
our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares. this bylaw provision may be repealed, in whole or in part, at any time, whether before or after an acquisition of control shares, by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote, and, upon such repeal, may, to the extent provided by any successor bylaw, apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition.

forward-looking statements certain statements in this section or elsewhere in this report may be deemed "forward-looking statements". see "item 1a. risk factors" in this report for important information regarding these forward-looking statements and certain risk and uncertainties that may affect us. the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
overview we are an equity real estate investment trust ("reit") specializing in the ownership, management, and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixed-use properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the northeast and mid-atlantic regions of the united states, california, and south florida. as of december 31, 2019, we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties which are operated as 104 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 23.7 million square feet. in total, the real estate projects were 94.2% leased and 92.5% occupied at december 31, 2019. we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 52 consecutive years.
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, referred to as "gaap", requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. these estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current events and economic conditions. in addition, information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information, external market information, when available, and when necessary, information obtained from consultations with third party experts. actual results could differ from these estimates. a discussion of possible risks which may
33
affect these estimates is included in "item 1a. risk factors" of this report. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements; however, the most critical accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and, therefore, may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates, are as follows:
revenue recognition and accounts receivable policy beginning january 1, 2019, with our adoption of accounting standards codification (asc) 842, "leases"
our leases with our tenants are classified as operating leases. when collection of substantially all lease payments during the lease term is considered probable, the lease qualifies for accrual accounting. lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease. variable lease payments relating to percentage rent are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved. real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred. for a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term, we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement. lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the termination date. when a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement, the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement.
when collection of substantially all lease payments during the lease term is not considered probable, total lease revenue is limited to the lesser of revenue recognized under accrual accounting or cash received. determining the probability of collection of substantially all lease payments during lease term requires judgment. this determination is impacted by numerous factors including our assessment of the tenant's credit worthiness, economic conditions, our historical experience with the tenant and tenants operating in the same industry, and the length of the lease term. if leases currently classified as probable are subsequently reclassified as not probable, any outstanding lease receivables (including straight-line rent receivables) would be written-off with a corresponding decrease in rental income. for example, in the event that our collectability determinations were not accurate and we were required to write off additional receivables equaling 1% of rental income, our rental income and net income would decrease by $9.3 million.
policy prior to january 1, 2019
prior to january 1, 2019, management estimates of collectability were considered when reserving for billed and accrued lease receivables and straight-line rent receivables. full and partial reserves were recorded when determined to be appropriate with a corresponding charge to bad debt expense. the primary impact of the adoption of asc 842, "leases," on our recognition of lease revenue relates to the upfront and ongoing assessment of the collectability of substantially all lease payments required by the new standard.
other revenue recognition policies when we enter into a transaction to sell a property or a portion of a property, we evaluate the recognition of the sale under asc 610-20, "other income - gains and losses from the derecognition of nonfinancial assets." in accordance with asc 610-20, we apply the guidance in asc 606, "revenue from contracts with customers," to determine whether and when control transfers and how to measure the associated gain or loss. we determine the transaction price based on the consideration we expect to receive. variable consideration is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of a gain recognized will not occur. we analyze the risk of a significant gain reversal and if necessary limit the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk. the estimation of variable consideration requires us to make assumptions and apply significant judgment.
real estate the nature of our business as an owner, redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixed-use properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital. depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole. we capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them on a straight-line basis in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets' physical and economic useful lives. we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes, as necessary, to these estimates and, therefore, to our depreciation rates. these reviews may take into account such factors as the historical retirement and replacement of our assets, expected redevelopments, and general economic and real estate factors. certain events, such as unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits, could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the
34
economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues. these assessments have a direct impact on our net income. the longer the economic useful life, the lower the depreciation expense will be for that asset in a fiscal period, which in turn will increase our net income. similarly, having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income.
land, buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost. we calculate depreciation using the straight-line method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and major improvements. maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred. tenant work and other major improvements, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements, whichever is shorter. minor improvements, furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 2 to 20 years.
capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease. unamortized leasing costs are charged to expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease. undepreciated tenant work is written-off if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced or has no future value. additionally, we make estimates as to the probability of certain development and redevelopment projects being completed. if we determine the redevelopment is no longer probable of completion, we immediately expense all capitalized costs which are not recoverable.
interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service. capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion, which is when the asset is ready for its intended use. generally, rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity. we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income. if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended, more interest is capitalized, thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period.
certain external and internal costs directly related to the development, redevelopment and leasing of real estate, including pre-construction costs, real estate taxes, insurance, and construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved, are capitalized. we capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities of $352 million and $9 million, respectively, for 2019 and $274 million and $8 million, respectively, for 2018. we capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements of $80 million and $3 million, respectively, for 2019 and $62 million and $3 million, respectively, for 2018. we capitalized external and internal costs related to leasing activities of $24 million and $2 million, respectively, for 2019 and $20 million and $6 million, respectively, for 2018. the amount of capitalized internal costs for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities, other property improvements, and leasing activities were $8 million, $3 million, and $2 million, respectively, for 2019 and $7 million, $3 million, and $6 million, respectively, for 2018. total capitalized costs were $471 million for 2019 and $373 million for 2018, respectively.
real estate acquisitions upon acquisition of operating real estate properties, we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired including land, building, improvements, leasing costs, intangibles such as in-place leases, assumed debt, and current assets and liabilities, if any.  based on these estimates, we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities. we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. the value allocated to in-place leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations. we consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and include such renewal options in the calculation of in-place lease value when we consider these to be bargain renewal options. if the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods, we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized. if a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease, the unamortized balance of any in-place lease value is written off to rental income.
variable interest entities (vies) and consolidation we have 18 entities that meet the criteria of a vie and are consolidated. net real estate assets related to vies included in our consolidated balance were approximately $1.5 billion for both december 31, 2019 and 2018, and mortgage payables related to vies included in our consolidated balance sheets were approximately $469.2 million and $444.4 million, as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. in addition, we hold equity method investments in two hotel joint ventures and one shopping center which are considered variable interests in a vie. vies are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary. the primary beneficiary of a vie has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of the vie and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the vie. the
35
determination of the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance requires judgment and is impacted by numerous factors including the purpose of the vie, contractual rights and obligations of variable interest holders, and mechanisms for the resolution of disputes among the variable interest holders.
long-lived assets and impairment there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time. this includes the recoverability of long-lived assets, including our properties that have been acquired or redeveloped and our investment in certain joint ventures. management's evaluation of impairment includes review for possible indicators of impairment as well as, in certain circumstances, undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis. since most of our investments in real estate are wholly-owned or controlled assets which are held for use, a property with impairment indicators is first tested for impairment by comparing the undiscounted cash flows, including residual value, to the current net book value of the property. if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value, the property is written down to expected fair value.
the calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues, operating expenses, required maintenance and development expenditures, market conditions, demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods. because our properties typically have a long life, the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment. actual results could be significantly different from the estimates. these estimates have a direct impact on net income, because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income.
contingencies we are sometimes involved in lawsuits, warranty claims, and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business. management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters. we accrue a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. if an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range, we accrue the best estimate within the range; however, if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum within the range is accrued. any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income.
self-insurance we are self-insured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim, and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability. we currently do not maintain third party stop-loss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. our accrual for self-insurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims projected to be incurred but not yet reported. management considers a number of factors, including third-party actuarial analysis, previous experience in our portfolio, and future increases in costs of claims, when making these determinations. if our liability costs differ from these accruals, it will increase or decrease our net income.

2019 property dispositions on december 11, 2019, we received $154.7 million in net proceeds related to the sale under the threat of condemnation of 11.7 acres of san antonio center to a local school district ("the condemning authority"). as part of the transaction, the condemning authority will commence condemnation proceedings in order to terminate all existing leases they assumed at closing. we have indemnified the condemning authority for all costs incurred related to the condemnation proceedings including any payments required to tenants at the property and expect the process will take several years to complete. the consideration in the transaction is considered variable because we have agreed to indemnify the condemning authority for these costs. consequently, we have recorded a liability of $45.5 million to reflect our estimate of the final consideration, net of estimated condemnation proceeding costs and other transaction related costs. the resulting net gain on sale is approximately $85.1 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2019, we sold three properties and one land parcel for a net sales price of $149.0 million, which resulted in a net gain of $28.3 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2019, we closed on the sale of 43 condominium units at our assembly row and pike & rose properties (combined), received proceeds net of closing costs of $20.1 million, and recognized a gain of $2.6 million, net of income taxes. the cost basis for the remaining condominium units as of december 31, 2019 is $1.7 million, and is included in "assets held for sale" on our consolidated balance sheets.
2019 significant debt and equity transactions on january 31, 2019, we repaid the $20.3 million mortgage loan on rollingwood apartments, at par, prior to its original maturity date.
on june 7, 2019, we issued $300.0 million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes that mature on june 15, 2029 and bear interest at 3.20%. the notes were offered at 99.838% of the principal amount with a yield to maturity of 3.219%. on august 21, 2019, we issued an additional $100.0 million senior notes of the same series and with the same terms. the august notes were offered at 103.813% of the principal amount, with a yield to maturity of 2.744%. the combined net proceeds from the note offerings after net issuance premium, underwriting fees, and other costs were $399.9 million, which were primarily used to repay our $275.0 million unsecured term loan, at par, on june 7, 2019 and for general corporate purposes.
on july 25, 2019, we amended our revolving credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion and extend the maturity date to january 19, 2024, plus two six-month extensions at our option. under the amended facility, the spread over libor is 77.5 basis points based on our current credit rating. in addition, we have an option (subject to bank approval) to increase the credit facility through an accordion feature to $1.5 billion.
in connection with our hoboken, new jersey acquisitions in 2019, we assumed mortgage loans with a face amount of $41.6 million and a fair value of $42.9 million, and entered into a new mortgage loan with a face amount of $56.5 million. the mortgage loans associated with our hoboken acquisitions have the following contractual terms:

(1)   the interest rate is effectively fixed at 3.67% as a result of two interest rate swap agreements.
(2)   the interest rates on these mortgages range from 3.91% to 5.00% and have maturity dates ranging from january 9, 2025 to may 31, 2029.
(3)   the interest rates on these mortgages range from 4.00% to 4.38% and have maturity dates ranging from october 1, 2025 to july 1, 2026.
on august 2, 2019, we acquired the 10.1% redeemable noncontrolling interest in the partnership that owns our montrose crossing shopping center for $10.0 million, bringing our ownership interest to 100%.
we have an at-the-market ("atm") equity program in which we may from time to time offer and sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $400.0 million. we intend to use the net proceeds to fund potential acquisition opportunities, fund our development and redevelopment pipeline, repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and/or for general corporate purposes. for the year ended december 31, 2019, we sold 1,069,699 common shares at a weighted average
37
price per share of $134.71 for net cash proceeds of $142.7 million and paid $1.2 million in commissions and $0.2 million in additional offering expenses related to the sales of these common shares. as of december 31, 2019, we had the capacity to issue up to $128.3 million in common shares under our atm equity program.
outlook we seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following:
•   growth in our comparable property portfolio,
•   growth in our portfolio from property development and redevelopments, and
•   expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions.
our comparable property growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals, changes in portfolio occupancy, and the redevelopment of those assets. over the long-term, the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and generally increase rental rates. we continue to see relatively strong levels of interest from prospective tenants for our retail spaces; however, the time it takes to complete new lease deals is longer, as tenants have become more selective and more deliberate in their decision-making process. we have also experienced extended periods of time for some government agencies to process permits and inspections further delaying rent commencement on newly leased spaces. additionally, we have seen an overall decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces, and have seen an uptick in the number of retail tenants vacating prior to the end of their lease term and/or filing for bankruptcy. we believe the locations and nature of our centers and diverse tenant base partially mitigates any potential negative changes in the economic environment. however, any significant reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent or other charges, will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. we seek to maintain a mix of strong national, regional, and local retailers. at december 31, 2019, no single tenant accounted for more than 2.6% of annualized base rent.
our properties are located primarily in densely populated and/or affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration, and/or retenanting. we evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities. we currently have redevelopment projects underway with a projected cost of approximately $315 million that we expect to stabilize in the next several years.
we continue our ongoing redevelopment efforts at santana row and are under construction on an eight story 301,000 square foot office building which will include an additional 20,000 square feet of retail space and 1,300 parking spaces. the building is expected to cost between $210 million and $220 million, to be delivered in 2020, and the office portion is 100% leased. after current phases, we have approximately 4 acres remaining for further redevelopment and entitlements in place for an additional 395 residential units and 321,000 square feet of commercial space.
additionally, we control 12 acres of land across from santana row, and we are proceeding with the first phase of construction on this land, which includes an eight story 376,000 square foot office building, with over 1,700 parking spaces. the building is expected to cost between $250 million and $270 million, with openings beginning in 2022. in addition, the land also has approximately 604,000 square feet of remaining commercial space entitlements.
phase ii of assembly row includes approximately 161,000 square feet of retail space, 447 residential units, and a 158 room boutique hotel (owned and operated by a joint venture in which we are a partner). as of december 31, 2019, phase ii is substantially complete with expected final costs of $298 million to $302 million. phase ii also included 122 for-sale condominium units, which had a total cost of $81 million and have all have been sold as of december 31, 2019.
additionally, we are under construction on phase iii of assembly row, which will include 277,000 square feet of office space (of which, 150,000 square feet is pre-leased), 56,000 square feet of retail space, 500 residential units, and over 800 additional parking spaces. the expected costs for phase iii are between $465 million and $485 million and is projected to open beginning in 2021.
phase ii of pike & rose includes approximately 219,000 square feet of retail space, 272 residential units, and a 177 room boutique hotel (owned and operated by a joint venture in which we are a partner), and is substantially complete as of december 31, 2019. the total cost for this portion of phase ii was $208 million. as of december 31, 2019, we closed on the sale of 97 of the 99 for-sale condominium units in phase ii. the condominiums had a final cost of $62 million.
additionally, at pike & rose, we commenced construction on a 212,000 square foot office building (which includes 4,000 square feet of ground floor retail space), and will include over 600 additional parking spaces. the building is expected to cost between $128 million and $135 million and is projected to open beginning in 2020.
38
we invested $258 million in assembly row, pike & rose, and santana row in 2019, net of public funding, and expect to invest between $320 million and $350 million in assembly row, pike & rose, and santana row in 2020.
the development of future phases of assembly row, pike & rose and santana row will be pursued opportunistically based on, among other things, market conditions, tenant demand, and our evaluation of whether those phases will generate an appropriate financial return.
we continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide long-term growth opportunities. initially, some of our acquisitions do not contribute significantly to earnings growth; however, we believe they provide long-term re-leasing growth, redevelopment opportunities, and other strategic opportunities. any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles. changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition. generally, our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash and/or borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new long-term debt. we may also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares, preferred shares, or downreit units as well as through assumed mortgages and property sales.
at december 31, 2019, the leasable square feet in our properties was 94.2% leased and 92.5% occupied. the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and, therefore, are not yet ready to be occupied. our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions, the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects, lease expirations and tenant closings and bankruptcies.
comparable properties throughout this section, we have provided certain information on a "comparable property" basis. information provided on a comparable property basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties that are currently under development or are being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment. for the year ended december 31, 2019 and the comparison of 2019 and 2018, all or a portion of 95 properties were considered comparable properties and eight properties were considered non-comparable properties. for the year ended december 31, 2019, seven properties were moved from acquisitions to comparable properties, two properties were removed from comparable properties as they were sold during 2019, one property was moved from acquisitions to non-comparable properties, and one portion of a property was moved from non-comparable properties to comparable properties, compared to the designations as of december 31, 2018. while there is judgment surrounding changes in designations, we typically move non-comparable properties to comparable properties once they have stabilized, which is typically considered 90% physical occupancy or when the growth expected from the redevelopment has been included in the comparable periods. we typically remove properties from comparable properties when the repositioning of the asset has commenced and has or is expected to have a significant impact to property operating income within the calendar year. acquisitions are moved to comparable properties once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under development or being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment. comparable property information replaces our previous same center designations.

(1) property operating income is a non-gaap financial measure. see item 6. selected financial data for further discussion.
property revenues total property revenue increased $20.4 million, or 2.2%, to $935.8 million in 2019 compared to $915.4 million in 2018. the percentage occupied at our shopping centers was 92.5% at december 31, 2019 compared to 93.6% at december 31, 2018. changes in the components of property revenue are discussed below.
rental income rental income consists primarily of minimum rent, cost reimbursements from tenants and percentage rent. rental income increased $20.5 million, or 2.2%, to $932.7 million in 2019 compared to $912.3 million in 2018 due primarily to the following:
•   an increase of $14.9 million at comparable properties due primarily to higher rental rates of approximately $11.8 million, higher lease termination fees and legal fee income of $7.6 million, and higher average occupancy of approximately $2.8 million, partially offset by a $4.4 million decrease in real estate tax recoveries primarily due to the requirements of the new lease accounting standard, and $2.5 million related to collectibility adjustments, which are now being presented as a reduction of rental income rather than rental expense (see note 2 for additional disclosure)
•   an increase of $9.2 million at non-comparable properties due primarily to the opening of phase ii at assembly row and pike &amp; rose partially offset by redevelopment related occupancy decreases at three properties, and
•   an increase of $3.9 million from acquisitions, primarily fairfax junction in february 2019, hoboken during the second half of 2019, and georgetowne shopping center in november 2019, partially offset by
•   a decrease of $8.4 million from property sales.
property expenses total property expenses increased $10.9 million, or 3.8%, to $298.8 million in 2019 compared to $287.9 million in 2018. changes in the components of property expenses are discussed below.
40
rental expenses rental expenses increased $14.7 million, or 8.5%, to $187.8 million in 2019 compared to $173.1 million in 2018. this increase is primarily due to the following:
•   an $11.9 million charge in 2019 related to the buyout of a lease at assembly square marketplace,
•   an increase of $1.9 million from comparable properties due primarily to a $5.2 million increase in repairs and maintenance costs partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in bad debt expense due to the new lease accounting standard requirement to record collectibility adjustments as a reduction to revenue rather than rental expense effective at adoption on january 1, 2019,
•   an increase of $1.2 million from non-comparable properties due primarily to the opening of phase ii at assembly row and pike &amp; rose, partially offset by lower expenses at two of our properties, and
•   an increase of $0.8 million from acquisitions, partially offset by
•   a decrease of $1.4 million from property sales.
as a result of the changes in rental income and rental expenses as discussed above, rental expenses as a percentage of rental income increased to 20.1% for the year ended december 31, 2019 from 19.0% for the year ended december 31, 2018.
real estate taxes real estate tax expense decreased $3.8 million, or 3.4% to $110.9 million in 2019 compared to $114.8 million in 2018 due primarily to the following:
•   a decrease of $3.2 million from comparable properties due primarily to the new lease accounting standard requirement, which no longer permits the gross up of real estate tax revenue and expense for real estate taxes that our tenants pay directly to the taxing authority (see note 2 for additional disclosure) of $5.0 million and a tax refund from a multi-year appeal and reassessment for three of our properties, partially offset by higher assessments, and
•   a decrease of $1.8 million from property sales, partially offset by
•   an increase of $0.7 million from acquisitions, and
•   an increase of $0.5 million at non-comparable properties due primarily to increases in assessments as a result of our redevelopment activities.
property operating income property operating income increased $9.5 million, or 1.5%, to $637.0 million in 2019 compared to $627.6 million in 2018. this increase is primarily due to growth in earnings at comparable properties, the opening of phase ii at assembly row and pike & rose, and our 2019 acquisitions, partially offset by the charge related to the buyout of a lease at assembly square marketplace, and property sales.
other operating general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased $9.2 million, or 27.2%, to $42.8 million in 2019 from $33.6 million in 2018. this increase is due primarily to higher leasing related costs as certain costs can no longer be capitalized as a result of the new lease accounting standard (see note 2 for additional disclosure) and higher personnel costs.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased $4.5 million, or 1.8%, to $239.8 million in 2019 from $244.2 million in 2018. this decrease is primarily due to lower accelerated depreciation related to tenants who vacated in advance of their lease expiration and property sales, partially offset by phase ii of assembly row and pike & rose being placed in service and our 2019 acquisitions.
gain on sale of real estate, net the $116.4 million gain on sale of real estate, net for the year ended december 31 2019 is primarily due to the following:
•   $85.1 million related to the sale under the threat of condemnation of 11.7 acres of san antonio center,
41
•   $28.3 million related to the sale of three properties and one land parcel,
•   $2.6 million net gain related to condominium unit sales that have closed at our assembly row and pike &amp; rose properties.
the $11.9 million gain on sale of real estate, net for the year ended december 31, 2018 is primarily due to the following:
•   $7.2 million net gain related to condominium unit sales that have closed at our assembly row and pike &amp; rose properties,
•   $4.7 million gain related to the sale of one property and the residential building at another one of our properties operating income operating income increased $109.3 million, or 30.2%, to $470.9 million in 2019 compared to $361.6 million in 2018. this increase is due primarily to higher gains on the sale of real estate in 2019, growth in earnings at our comparable properties, and the opening of phase ii of assembly row and pike & rose, partially offset by the charge related to the buyout of a lease at assembly square marketplace, higher leasing and personnel related costs, and property sales.
other interest expense interest expense decreased $0.5 million, or 0.5%, to $109.6 million in 2019 compared to $110.2 million in 2018. this decrease is due primarily to a $1.6 million increase in capitalized interest partially offset by a $1.1 million increase due to a higher weighted average borrowing rate in 2019.
gross interest costs were $130.1 million and $129.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. capitalized interest was $20.5 million and $18.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
loss from partnerships loss from partnerships decreased to $2.0 million in 2019 compared to $3.4 million in 2018. this decrease is due primarily to improved operating results at our assembly row and pike & rose hotel joint ventures, which opened in august 2018 and march 2018, respectively.
discussions of year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018 filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 13, 2019.
liquidity and capital resources due to the nature of our business and strategy, we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations. the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends. as a reit, we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90% of our taxable income.
our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses, obligations under our capital and operating leases, regular debt service requirements (including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt, as well as scheduled debt maturities), recurring expenditures, non-recurring expenditures (such as tenant improvements and redevelopments) and dividends to common and preferred shareholders. our long-term capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our long-term debt agreements, development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions.
we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed-charge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investment-grade debt ratings. in the short and long term, we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity, unsecured and/or secured debt financings, joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions, and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure.
at december 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $127.4 million and no outstanding balance on our unsecured revolving credit facility. for the year ended 2019, the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility was $116.5 million, the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding was $26.8 million, and the weighted average interest rate, before amortization of debt fees, was 3.2%.
on june 7, 2019, we issued $300.0 million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes that mature on june 15, 2029 and bear interest at 3.20%. on august 21, 2019, we issued an additional $100.0 million senior notes of the same series and with the same terms.
42
the combined net proceeds of $399.9 million were primarily used to repay our $275.0 million unsecured term loan, which was scheduled to mature in november 2019. during 2020, we have only $60.6 million of debt maturing.
on july 25, 2019, we amended our revolving credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity from $800.0 million to $1.0 billion, lower our spread over libor from 82.5 basis points to 77.5 basis points, and extend the maturity date to january 19, 2024, plus two six-month extensions at our option. in addition,we have an option (subject to bank approval) to increase the credit facility through an accordion feature to $1.5 billion.
during 2019, we raised $142.7 million under our atm equity program after fees and other costs, and as of december 31, 2019, we had the capacity to issue up to $128.3 million in common shares under the atm program. we currently believe that cash flows from operations, cash on hand, our atm program, our revolving credit facility and our general ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our debt service requirements and capital expenditures.
our overall capital requirements during 2020 will depend upon acquisition opportunities, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of assembly row, pike & rose and santana row. while the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors, we expect to continue to see higher levels of capital investments in our properties under development and redevelopment, as we continue to invest in the next phase of these projects. with respect to other capital investments related to our existing properties, we expect to incur levels consistent with prior years. our capital investments will be funded on a short-term basis with cash flow from operations, cash on hand and/or our revolving credit facility, and on a long-term basis, with long-term debt or equity including shares issued under our atm equity program. if necessary, we may access the debt or equity capital markets to finance significant acquisitions. given our past ability to access the capital markets, we expect debt or equity to be available to us. although there is no intent at this time, if market conditions deteriorate, we may also delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions, reduce our operating expenditures, or re-evaluate our dividend policy.
in addition to conditions in the capital markets which could affect our ability to access those markets, the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements:
•   restrictions in our debt instruments or preferred shares may limit us from incurring debt or issuing equity at all, or on acceptable terms under then-prevailing market conditions; and
•   we may be unable to service additional or replacement debt due to increases in interest rates or a decline in our operating performance.

net cash provided by operating activities decreased $54.8 million to $461.9 million during 2019 from $516.7 million during 2018. the decrease was primarily attributable to the $14.5 million lease buyout payment at assembly square marketplace in august 2019, $12.4 million in net proceeds in 2018 from the freedom plaza new market tax credit transaction (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion), and the timing of cash receipts.
net cash used in investing activities increased $124.3 million to $316.5 million during 2019 from $192.2 million during 2018. the increase was primarily attributable to:
•   a $191.0 million increase in acquisitions of real estate, primarily due to the acquisitions of georgetowne shopping center, 37 mixed-use buildings in hoboken, new jersey, and fairfax junction in 2019,
•   a $41.7 million increase in capital expenditures as we continue to invest in pike &amp; rose, assembly row, santana row and other redevelopments, and
•   $38.0 million in proceeds from our assembly row hotel joint venture formation in 2018,
43
partially offset by
•   a $144.2 million increase in proceeds from sales of real estate, resulting from the sale under the threat of condemnation of a portion of san antonio center in december 2019 and the sale of three additional properties in 2019 compared to two properties in 2018, partially offset by a decrease in the sale of condominiums at our assembly row and pike &amp; rose properties.
net cash used in financing activities decreased $141.2 million to $100.1 million during 2019 from $241.3 million during 2018. the decrease was primarily attributable to:
•   $399.9 million in net proceeds from the issuance of $300.0 million of 3.20% senior unsecured notes in june 2019 and an additional $100.0 million of the same series in august 2019,

1)   on november 26, 2019, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that fix the interest rate on the mortgage loan at 3.67%.
2)   this mortgage loan has a fixed interest rate, however, the rate resets every five years until maturity. the current interest rate is fixed until july 1, 2022, and the loan is prepayable at par anytime after this date.
3)   the interest rates on these mortgages range from 3.91% to 5.00%.
4)   the maximum amount drawn under our revolving credit facility during 2019 was $116.5 million and the weighted average effective interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility, before amortization of debt fees, was 3.2%.

our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future. as of december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants related to our revolving credit facility and senior notes. additionally, as of december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants that could trigger loan default on our mortgage loans. if we were to breach any of these financial and other covenants and did not cure the breach within an applicable cure period, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and, if the debt is secured, could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan. many of our debt arrangements, including our public notes and our revolving credit facility, are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations. as a result, any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares. our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur.
the following is a summary of our scheduled principal repayments as of december 31, 2019:

1)   our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility matures on january 19, 2024, plus two six-month extensions at our option. as of december 31, 2019, there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility.
2)   the total debt maturities differ from the total reported on the consolidated balance sheet due to the unamortized net premium/discount and debt issuance costs on mortgage loans, notes payable, and senior notes as of december 31, 2019.
interest rate hedging we may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk. we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt. we enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. effectiveness of cash flow hedges is assessed both at inception and on an ongoing basis. the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the balance sheet and statement of shareholders' equity. cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts, settlement dates, reset dates, calculation period and libor rate. in addition, the default risk of the counterparty is evaluated by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance. if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective, the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected.
during 2019, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on a mortgage payable associated with our hoboken acquisition at 3.67%. our assembly row hotel joint venture is also a party to two interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on the joint venture's mortgage debt at 5.206%. all swaps were designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. hedge ineffectiveness has not impacted our earnings in 2019, 2018 and 2017.
reit qualification we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856(c) of the code. as a reit, we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code, including the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders.

funds from operations funds from operations ("ffo") is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of real estate companies' operating performance. the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") defines ffo as follows: net income, computed in accordance with u.s. gaap, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses on the sale of real estate, and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate. we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition, and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities. it should be noted that ffo:
•   does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap (which, unlike ffo, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income);
•   should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance; and
•   is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to fund cash needs, including the payment of dividends.
we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation. we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits. comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits.
an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status. however, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to remain qualified as a reit. therefore, a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis.
the reconciliation of net income to ffo available for common shareholders is as follows:

(1)   for the year ended december 31, 2019, ffo available for common shareholders includes an $11.9 million charge relating to the buyout of a lease at assembly square marketplace. if this charge was excluded, our ffo available for common shareholders for 2019 would have been $477.7 million, and ffo available for common shareholders, per diluted share would have been $6.33. for the year ended december 31, 2017, ffo available for common shareholders includes a $12.3 million charge related to early extinguishment of debt. if this charge was excluded, our ffo available for common shareholders for 2017 would have been $432.2 million, and ffo available for common shareholders, per diluted share would have been $5.91.
48
(2)   the weighted average common shares used to compute ffo per diluted common share also includes operating partnership units that were excluded from the computation of diluted eps. conversion of these operating partnership units is dilutive in the computation of ffo per diluted common share but is anti-dilutive for the computation of diluted eps for the periods presented.

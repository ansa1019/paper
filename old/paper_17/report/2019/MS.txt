credit quality crm evaluates new obligors before credit transactions are initially approved and at least annually thereafter for corporate and commercial real estate loans. for corporate loans, credit evaluations typically involve the evaluation of financial statements, assessment of leverage, liquidity, capital strength, asset composition and quality, market capitalization and access to capital markets, cash flow projections and debt service requirements, and the adequacy of collateral, if applicable. crm also evaluates strategy, market position, industry dynamics, obligor's management and other factors that could affect an obligor's risk profile.
for commercial real estate loans, the credit evaluation is focused on property and transaction metrics, including property type, loan-to-value ratio, occupancy levels, debt service ratio, prevailing capitalization rates and market dynamics.
for residential real estate and consumer loans, the initial credit evaluation typically includes, but is not limited to, review of the obligor's income, net worth, liquidity, collateral, loan-to-value ratio and credit bureau information. subsequent credit monitoring for residential real estate loans is performed at the portfolio level. consumer loan collateral values are monitored on an ongoing basis.
the firm utilizes the following credit quality indicators, which are consistent with u.s. banking agencies' definitions of criticized exposures, as applicable, in its credit monitoring process for loans held for investment:
•   pass. a credit exposure rated pass has a continued expectation of timely repayment, all obligations of the borrower are current, and the obligor complies with material terms and conditions of the lending agreement.
•   special mention. extensions of credit that have potential weakness that deserve management's close attention and, if left uncorrected, may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects or collateral position.
•   substandard. obligor has a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the repayment of the debt and has a high probability of payment default with the distinct possibility that the firm will sustain some loss if noted deficiencies are not corrected.
•   doubtful. inherent weakness in the exposure makes the collection or repayment in full, based on existing facts, conditions and circumstances, highly improbable, and the amount of loss is uncertain.
•   loss. extensions of credit classified as loss are considered uncollectible and are charged off.
loans considered as doubtful or loss are considered impaired. substandard loans are regularly reviewed for impairment. for further information, see note 2.

1.   variable rate borrowings bear interest based on a variety of indices, including libor, federal funds rates and sofr. amounts include notes carried at fair value with various payment provisions, including notes linked to the performance of a specific index, a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a commodity, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures, and instruments with various interest-rate-related features, including step-ups, step-downs and zero coupons.
2.   the amount shown for the parent company represents amounts due to holders of the firm's series g preferred stock for which a notice of redemption was issued. see note 16 for further information.

certain senior debt securities are denominated in various non-u.s. dollar currencies and may be structured to provide a return that is linked to equity, credit, commodity or other indices (e.g., the consumer price index). senior debt also may be structured to be callable by the firm or extendible at the option of holders of the senior debt securities.
the firm's borrowings also include notes carried and managed on a fair value basis. these include instruments whose payments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index, a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a commodity, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures, and instruments with various interest-rate-related features, including step-ups, step-downs and zero coupons. to minimize the exposure from such instruments, the firm has entered into various swap contracts and purchased options that effectively convert the borrowing costs into floating rates. the swaps and purchased options used to economically hedge the embedded features are derivatives and also are carried at fair value. changes in fair value related to the notes and economic hedges are reported in trading revenues. see notes 2 and 4 for further information on borrowings carried at fair value.

in general, other than securities inventories and customer balances financed by secured funding sources, the majority of the firm's assets are financed with a combination of deposits, short-term funding, floating rate long-term debt or fixed rate long-term debt swapped to a floating rate. the firm uses interest rate swaps to more closely match these borrowings to the duration, holding period and interest rate characteristics of the assets being funded and to manage interest rate risk. these swaps effectively convert certain of the firm's fixed rate borrowings into floating rate obligations. in addition, for non-u.s. dollar currency borrowings that are not used to fund assets in the same currency, the firm has entered into currency swaps that effectively convert the borrowings into u.s. dollar obligations.
the firm's use of swaps for asset and liability management affects its effective average borrowing rate.

types of commitments lending commitments.  lending commitments primarily represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for different types of loan transactions. this category also includes commitments in loan form provided to clearinghouses or associated depositories of which the firm is a member and are contingent upon the default of a clearinghouse member or other stress event. for syndications that are led by the firm, the lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed are net of the amounts agreed
121     december 2019 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements to by counterparties that will participate in the syndication. for syndications that the firm participates in and does not lead, lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed include only the amount that the firm expects it will be allocated from the lead syndicate bank. due to the nature of the firm's obligations under the commitments, these amounts include certain commitments participated to third parties.
forward-starting secured financing receivables.  this amount includes securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed that the firm has entered into prior to the balance sheet date that will settle after the balance sheet date. also included are commitments to enter into securities purchased under agreements to resell that are provided to certain clearinghouses or associated depositories of which the firm is a member and are contingent upon the default of a clearinghouse member or other stress event. these transactions are primarily secured by collateral from u.s. government agency securities and other sovereign government obligations when they are funded.
underwriting commitments.  the firm provides underwriting commitments in connection with its capital raising sources to a diverse group of corporate and other institutional clients.
investment activities.  the firm sponsors several non-consolidated investment management funds for third-party investors where it typically acts as general partner of, and investment advisor to, these funds and typically commits to invest a minority of the capital of such funds, with subscribing third-party investors contributing the majority. the firm has contractual capital commitments, guarantees and counterparty arrangements with respect to these investment management funds.
letters of credit and other financial guarantees.  the firm has outstanding letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued by third-party banks to certain of the firm's counterparties. the firm is contingently liable for these letters of credit and other financial guarantees, which are primarily used to provide collateral for securities and commodities traded and to satisfy various margin requirements in lieu of depositing cash or securities with these counterparties.

1.   these amounts include certain issued standby letters of credit participated to third parties, totaling $0.7 billion of notional and collateral/recourse, due to the nature of the firm's obligations under these arrangements.
2.   the carrying amounts of derivative contracts that meet the accounting definition of a guarantee are shown on a gross basis.
3.   primarily related to residential mortgage securitizations.
types of guarantees derivative contracts. certain derivative contracts meet the accounting definition of a guarantee, including certain written options, contingent forward contracts and cds (see note 5 regarding credit derivatives in which the firm has sold credit protection to the counterparty). all derivative contracts that could meet this accounting definition of a guarantee are included in the previous table, with the notional amount used as the maximum potential payout for certain derivative contracts, such as written interest rate caps and written foreign currency options. the firm evaluates collateral requirements for all derivatives, including derivatives that do not meet the accounting definition of a guarantee. for the effects of cash collateral and counterparty netting, see note 5.

notes to consolidated financial statements firm sets collateral requirements by counterparty so that the collateral covers various transactions and products and is not allocated specifically to individual contracts. also, the firm may recover amounts related to the underlying asset delivered to the firm under the derivative contract.
standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued. in connection with its corporate lending business and other corporate activities, the firm provides standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees to counterparties. such arrangements represent obligations to make payments to third parties if the counterparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a borrowing arrangement or other contractual obligation. a majority of the firm's standby letters of credit are provided on behalf of counterparties that are investment grade. if the counterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligation, the firm has access to collateral or recourse that would approximate its obligation.
market value guarantees. market value guarantees are issued to guarantee timely payment of a specified return to investors in certain affordable housing tax credit funds. these guarantees are designed to return an investor's contribution to a fund and the investor's share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by a fund.
liquidity facilities. the firm has entered into liquidity facilities with spes and other counterparties, whereby the firm is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. primarily, the firm acts as liquidity provider to municipal bond securitization spes and for standalone municipal bonds in which the holders of beneficial interests issued by these spes or the holders of the individual bonds, respectively, have the right to tender their interests for purchase by the firm on specified dates at a specified price. the firm often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the spes in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities, as well as make-whole or recourse provisions with the trust sponsors. the recourse amount often exceeds the maximum potential payout amount of the guarantee. substantially all of the underlying assets in the spes are investment grade. liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives.
whole loan sales guarantees. the firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain whole loan sales. under certain circumstances, the firm may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. the firm's maximum potential payout related to such representations and warranties is equal to the current upb of such loans. since the firm no longer services these loans, it has no information on the current upb of those loans, and accordingly, the amount included in the previous table represents the upb at the time of the whole loan sale or at the time when the firm last serviced any of those loans. the current upb balances could be substantially lower than the maximum potential payout amount included in the previous table. the related liability primarily relates to sales of loans to the federal mortgage agencies.
securitization representations and warranties. as part of the firm's institutional securities business segment's securitizations and related activities, the firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain assets transferred in securitization transactions sponsored by the firm. the extent and nature of the representations and warranties, if any, vary among different securitizations. under certain circumstances, the firm may be required to repurchase certain assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. the maximum potential amount of future payments the firm could be required to make would be equal to the current outstanding balances of, or losses associated with, the assets subject to breaches of such representations and warranties. the amount included in the previous table for the maximum potential payout includes the current upb or historical losses where known, and the upb at the time of sale when the current upb is not known.
general partner guarantees. as a general partner in certain investment management funds, the firm receives certain distributions from the partnerships when the return exceeds specified performance targets according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. the firm may be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements, subject to certain limitations.
client clearing guarantees. in 2019, the firm became a sponsoring member of the government securities division of the ficc's sponsored clearing model. clients of the firm, as sponsored members, can transact in overnight securities repurchase and resale agreements, which are cleared through ficc. as sponsoring member, the firm guarantees to ficc the prompt and full payment and performance of its clients' obligations. the amount included in the previous table represents the maximum potential payout the firm could be responsible for through the guarantee it provides. the firm minimizes credit exposure under this guarantee by obtaining a security interest in its sponsored member clients' collateral and their contractual rights under sponsored member transactions. therefore, the firm's exposure is estimated to be an amount substantially lower than the maximum potential payout amount. the collateral amount in which the firm has a security interest is approximately equal to the maximum potential payout amount of the guarantee.
other guarantees and indemnities in the normal course of business, the firm provides guarantees and indemnifications in a variety of transactions. these
123     december 2019 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements provisions generally are standard contractual terms. certain of these guarantees and indemnifications are described below:
•   indemnities. the firm provides standard indemnities to counterparties for certain contingent exposures and taxes, including u.s. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest and other payments made on derivatives, securities and stock lending transactions, certain annuity products and other financial arrangements. these indemnity payments could be required based on a change in the tax laws, a change in interpretation of applicable tax rulings or a change in factual circumstances. certain contracts contain provisions that enable the firm to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of such events. the maximum potential amount of future payments that the firm could be required to make under these indemnifications cannot be estimated.
•   exchange/clearinghouse member guarantees. the firm is a member of various exchanges and clearinghouses that trade and clear securities and/or derivative contracts. associated with its membership, the firm may be required to pay a certain amount as determined by the exchange or the clearinghouse in case of a default of any of its members or pay a proportionate share of the financial obligations of another member that may default on its obligations to the exchange or the clearinghouse. while the rules governing different exchange or clearinghouse memberships and the forms of these guarantees may vary, in general the firm's obligations under these rules would arise only if the exchange or clearinghouse had previously exhausted its resources.
in addition, some clearinghouse rules require members to assume a proportionate share of losses resulting from the clearinghouse's investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, and of other losses unrelated to the default of a clearing member, if such losses exceed the specified resources allocated for such purpose by the clearinghouse.
the maximum potential payout under these rules cannot be estimated. the firm has not recorded any contingent liability in its financial statements for these agreements and believes that any potential requirement to make payments under these agreements is remote.
•   merger and acquisition guarantees. the firm may, from time to time, in its role as investment banking advisor be required to provide guarantees in connection with certain european merger and acquisition transactions. if required by the regulating authorities, the firm provides a guarantee that the acquirer in the merger and acquisition transaction has or will have sufficient funds to complete the transaction and would then be required to make the acquisition payments in the event the acquirer's funds are insufficient at the completion date of the transaction. these arrangements generally cover the time frame from the transaction offer date to its closing date and, therefore, are generally short term in nature. the firm believes the likelihood of any payment by the firm under these arrangements is remote given the level of its due diligence in its role as investment banking advisor.
in addition, in the ordinary course of business, the firm guarantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations (including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. these guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties. the activities of the firm's subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the financial statements.
contingencies legal in addition to the matters described below, in the normal course of business, the firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. in some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress. these actions have included, but are not limited to, residential mortgage and credit crisis-related matters.
while the firm has identified below any individual proceedings where the firm believes a material loss to be reasonably possible and reasonably estimable, there can be no assurance that material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be probable or possible and reasonably estimable losses.
the firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the firm accrues the estimated loss by a charge to income.

legal expenses      $221          $206          $342
the firm's future legal expenses may fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment regarding government investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the firm.

notes to consolidated financial statements previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss.
for certain legal proceedings and investigations, the firm cannot reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question, before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation.
for certain other legal proceedings and investigations, the firm can estimate reasonably possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued but does not believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that such losses will have a material adverse effect on the firm's financial statements as a whole, other than the matters referred to in the following paragraphs.

14. variable interest entities and securitization activities overview the firm is involved with various spes in the normal course of business. in most cases, these entities are deemed to be vies.
the firm's variable interests in vies include debt and equity interests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments and certain fees. the firm's involvement with vies arises primarily from:
•   interests purchased in connection with market-making activities, securities held in its investment securities portfolio and retained interests held as a result of securitization activities, including re-securitization transactions.
•   guarantees issued and residual interests retained in connection with municipal bond securitizations.
•   loans made to and investments in vies that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.
•   derivatives entered into with vies.
•   structuring of clns or other asset-repackaged notes designed to meet the investment objectives of clients.
•   other structured transactions designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the firm or its clients.
the firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a vie upon its initial involvement with the vie and reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the vie. this determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the vie, including the vie's structure and activities, the power to make significant economic decisions held by the firm and by other parties, and the variable interests owned by the firm and other parties.

notes to consolidated financial statements unless it holds certain other rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager or to require the liquidation of the entity. if the firm serves as servicer or collateral manager, or has certain other rights described in the previous sentence, the firm analyzes the interests in the vie that it holds and consolidates only those vies for which it holds a potentially significant interest in the vie.
for many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, clns and other asset-repackaged notes, there are no significant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. in these cases, the firm focuses its analysis on decisions made prior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the termination of the transaction. the firm concluded in most of these transactions that decisions made prior to the initial closing were shared between the firm and the initial investors based upon the nature of the assets, including whether the assets were issued in a transaction sponsored by the firm and the extent of the information available to the firm and to investors, the number, nature and involvement of investors, other rights held by the firm and investors, the standardization of the legal documentation and the level of continuing involvement by the firm, including the amount and type of interests owned by the firm and by other investors. the firm focused its control decision on any right held by the firm or investors related to the termination of the vie. most re-securitization transactions, clns and other asset-repackaged notes have no such termination rights.

consolidated vie assets and liabilities are presented in the previous tables after intercompany eliminations. generally, most assets owned by consolidated vies cannot be removed unilaterally by the firm and are not available to the firm while the related liabilities issued by consolidated vies are non-recourse to the firm. however, in certain consolidated vies, the firm either has the unilateral right to remove assets or provides additional recourse through derivatives such as total return swaps, guarantees or other forms of involvement.
in general, the firm's exposure to loss in consolidated vies is limited to losses that would be absorbed on the vie net assets recognized in its financial statements, net of amounts absorbed by third-party variable interest holders.

1.   amounts include transactions backed by residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans and other types of assets, including consumer or commercial assets. and may be in loan or security form.
2.   other primarily includes exposures to commercial real estate property and investment funds.
3.   where notional amounts are utilized in quantifying the maximum exposure related to derivatives, such amounts do not reflect changes in fair value recorded by the firm.
4.   additional vie assets owned represents the carrying value of total exposure to non-consolidated vies for which the maximum exposure to loss is less than specific thresholds, primarily interests issued by securitization spes. the firm's primary risk exposure is to the most subordinate class of beneficial interest and maximum exposure to loss generally equals the fair value of the assets owned. these assets are primarily included in trading assets and investment securities and are measured at fair value (see note 3). the firm does not provide additional support in these transactions through contractual facilities, guarantees or similar derivatives.
5.   the carrying value and maximum exposure to loss of variable interests related to mabs and other have been revised to reflect the addition of approximately $11 billion in loans to vies that were previously excluded. the vie asset (upb) amounts have also been revised by approximately $54 billion. this disclosure-only revision did not impact the firm's balance sheets.
the majority of the vies included in the previous tables are sponsored by unrelated parties; examples of the firm's involvement with these vies include its secondary market-making activities and the securities held in its investment securities portfolio (see note 6).
the firm's maximum exposure to loss is dependent on the nature of the firm's variable interest in the vie and is limited to the notional amounts of certain liquidity facilities and other credit support, total return swaps and written put options, as well as the fair value of certain other derivatives and investments the firm has made in the vie.
the firm's maximum exposure to loss in the previous tables does not include the offsetting benefit of hedges or any reductions associated with the amount of collateral held as part of a transaction with the vie or any party to the vie directly against a specific exposure to loss.
liabilities issued by vies generally are non-recourse to the firm.

1.   the balances as of december 31, 2018 were revised as noted in the non-consolidated vies table herein.
securitization activities in a securitization transaction, the firm transfers assets (generally commercial or residential mortgage loans or securities) to an spe, sells to investors most of the beneficial interests, such as notes or certificates, issued by the spe, and, in many cases, retains other beneficial interests. the purchase of the transferred assets by the spe is financed through the sale of these interests.
in many securitization transactions involving commercial mortgage loans, the firm transfers a portion of the assets to the spe with unrelated parties transferring the remaining assets. in addition, mainly in securitization transactions involving residential mortgage loans, the firm may also enter into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps or interest rate caps, with the spe.
although not obligated, the firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by spes in securitization transactions. as a market maker, the firm offers to buy these securities from, and sell these securities to, investors. securities purchased through these market-making activities are not considered to be retained interests; these beneficial interests generally are included in trading assets-corporate and other debt and are measured at fair value.
the firm enters into derivatives, generally interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, with a senior payment priority in many securitization transactions. the risks associated with these and similar derivatives with spes are essentially the same as similar derivatives with non-spe counterparties and are managed as part of the firm's overall exposure. see note 5 for further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities.
investment securities the firm holds securities issued by vies within the investment securities portfolio. these securities are composed of those related to transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage agencies and predominantly the most senior securities issued by vies backed by student loans and commercial mortgage loans.

notes to consolidated financial statements transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage agencies include an explicit or implicit guarantee provided by the u.s. government. additionally, the firm holds certain commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by vies retained as a result of the firm's securitization activities. see note 6 for further information on the investment securities portfolio.
municipal tender option bond trusts in a municipal tender option bond trust transaction, the client transfers a municipal bond to a trust. the trust issues short-term securities that the firm, as the remarketing agent, sells to investors. the client generally retains a residual interest. the short-term securities are supported by a liquidity facility pursuant to which the investors may put their short-term interests. in most programs, a third-party provider will provide such liquidity facility; in some programs, the firm provides this liquidity facility.
the firm may, in lieu of purchasing short-term securities for remarketing, decide to extend a temporary loan to the trust. the client can generally terminate the transaction at any time. the liquidity provider can generally terminate the transaction upon the occurrence of certain events. when the transaction is terminated, the municipal bond is generally sold or returned to the client. any losses suffered by the liquidity provider upon the sale of the bond are the responsibility of the client. this obligation is generally collateralized. liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives. the firm consolidates any municipal tender option bond trusts in which it holds the residual interest.
credit protection purchased through credit-linked notes cln transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain credit risk on referenced assets. in these transactions, the firm transfers assets (generally high-quality securities or money market investments) to an spe, enters into a derivative transaction in which the spe sells protection on an unrelated referenced asset or group of assets, through a credit derivative, and sells the securities issued by the spe to investors. in some transactions, the firm may also enter into interest rate or currency swaps with the spe. depending on the structure, the assets and liabilities of the spe may be consolidated and recognized in the firm's balance sheets or accounted for as a sale of assets.
upon the occurrence of a credit event related to the referenced asset, the spe will deliver securities collateral as payment to the firm, which exposes the firm to changes in the collateral's value.
derivative payments by the spe are collateralized. the risks associated with these and similar derivatives with spes are essentially the same as those with non-spe counterparties and are managed as part of the firm's overall exposure.
other structured financings the firm invests in interests issued by entities that develop and own low-income communities (including low-income housing projects) and entities that construct and own facilities that will generate energy from renewable resources. the interests entitle the firm to a share of tax credits and tax losses generated by these projects. in addition, the firm has issued guarantees to investors in certain low-income housing funds. the guarantees are designed to return an investor's contribution to a fund and the investor's share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by the fund. the firm is also involved with entities designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the firm or its clients.
collateralized loan and debt obligations clos and cdos are spes that purchase a pool of assets consisting of corporate loans, corporate bonds, abs or synthetic exposures on similar assets through derivatives, and issue multiple tranches of debt and equity securities to investors. the firm underwrites the securities issued in certain clo transactions on behalf of unaffiliated sponsors and provides advisory services to these unaffiliated sponsors. the firm sells corporate loans to many of these spes, in some cases representing a significant portion of the total assets purchased. although not obligated, the firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by spes in these transactions and may retain unsold securities. these beneficial interests are included in trading assets and are measured at fair value.
equity-linked notes eln transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain risks related to the specific equity security, equity index or other index. in an eln transaction, the firm typically transfers to an spe either a note issued by the firm, the payments on which are linked to the performance of a specific equity security, equity index or other index, or debt securities issued by other companies and a derivative contract, the terms of which will relate to the performance of a specific equity security, equity index or other index. these eln transactions with spes were not consolidated at december 31, 2019 or december 31, 2018.

1.   the transferred assets with continuing involvement tables include transactions with spes in which the firm, acting as principal, transferred financial assets with continuing involvement and received sales treatment. see note 12 for information on certain other transfers of assets to spes which are accounted for as financings.
2.   as permitted by applicable guidance, certain transfers of assets where the firm's only continuing involvement is a derivative are only reported in the following assets sold with retained exposure table, and are no longer also included in this table. at december 31, 2018 these transactions were included in cln and other and comprised approximately $8 billion in upb, $20 million in derivative assets and $119 million in derivative liabilities.
3.   amounts include clo transactions managed by unrelated third parties.
4.   amounts include assets transferred by unrelated transferors.
transferred assets are carried at fair value prior to securitization, and any changes in fair value are recognized in the income statements. the firm may act as underwriter of the beneficial interests issued by these securitization vehicles, for which investment banking revenues are recognized. the firm may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. these retained interests are generally carried at fair value in the balance sheets with changes in fair value recognized in the income statements. fair value for these interests is measured using techniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques applied to the firm's major categories of assets and liabilities as described in notes 2 and 3.

15. regulatory requirements regulatory capital framework the firm is an fhc under the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended, and is subject to the regulation and oversight of the board of governors of the federal reserve system ("federal reserve"). the federal reserve establishes capital requirements for the firm, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates the firm's compliance with such capital requirements. the occ establishes similar capital requirements and standards for msbna and mspbna (collectively, the "u.s. bank subsidiaries"). the regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the basel iii capital standards established by the basel committee on banking supervision and also implement certain provisions of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act.
regulatory capital requirements the firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital requirements. a summary of the calculations of regulatory capital, rwa and transition provisions follows.
minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital (which includes tier 2 capital). capital standards require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios.
in addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements, the firm is subject to the following buffers:
•   a greater than 2.5% common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer;
•   the common equity tier 1 g-sib capital surcharge, currently at 3%; and
•   up to a 2.5% common equity tier 1 ccyb, currently set by u.s. banking agencies at zero.
in 2018, the requirement for each of these buffers was 75% of the fully phased-in 2019 requirement noted above.
risk-weighted assets rwa reflects both the firm's on- and off-balance sheet risk, as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following:
•   credit risk: the failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to the firm;
•   market risk: adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and
•   operational risk: inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events (e.g., fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets).
the firm's risk-based capital ratios for purposes of determining regulatory compliance are the lower of the capital ratios computed under (i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk rwa ("standardized approach") and (ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk rwa ("advanced approach"). at december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, the firm's risk-based capital ratios are based on the standardized approach rules.
minimum leverage-based capital requirements include a tier 1 leverage ratio and an slr. the firm is required to maintain a tier 1 slr of 5%, inclusive of an enhanced slr capital buffer of at least 2%.

1.   required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented. for 2018, the required regulatory capital ratios for risk-based capital are under the transitional rules. failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on the firm's ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.
2.   adjusted average assets represents the denominator of the tier 1 leverage ratio and is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by disallowed goodwill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in the firm's own capital instruments, certain defined tax assets and other capital deductions.
3.   supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of adjusted average assets used in the tier 1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, potential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures.
u.s. bank subsidiaries' regulatory capital and capital ratios the occ establishes capital requirements for the firm's u.s. bank subsidiaries and evaluates their compliance with such capital requirements. regulatory capital requirements for the u.s. bank subsidiaries are calculated in a similar manner to the firm's regulatory capital requirements, although g-sib capital surcharge requirements do not apply to the u.s. bank subsidiaries.
the occ's regulatory capital framework includes prompt corrective action ("pca") standards, including "well-capitalized" pca standards that are based on specified regulatory capital ratio minimums. for the firm to remain an fhc, the u.s. bank subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with the occ's pca standards. in addition, failure by the u.s. bank subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the u.s. bank subsidiaries' and the firm's financial statements.
at december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, the u.s. bank subsidiaries' risk-based capital ratios are based on the standardized approach rules. in each period, the ratios exceeded well-capitalized requirements.

the firm's 2019 capital plan ("capital plan") includes the share repurchase of up to $6.0 billion of outstanding common stock for the period beginning july 1, 2019 through june 30, 2020. additionally, the capital plan includes quarterly common stock dividends of up to $0.35 per share, beginning with the common stock dividend announced on july 18, 2019.
a portion of common stock repurchases was conducted under a sales plan with mufg, whereby mufg sold shares of the firm's common stock to the firm, as part of the firm's share repurchase program. the sales plan is only intended to maintain mufg's ownership percentage below 24.9% in order to comply with mufg's passivity commitments to the board of governors of the federal reserve system and has no impact on the strategic alliance between mufg and the firm, including the joint ventures in japan.
pursuant to the share repurchase program, the firm considers, among other things, business segment capital needs, as well as stock-based compensation and benefit plan requirements. share repurchases under the program will be exercised from time to time at prices the firm deems appropriate subject to various factors, including the firm's capital position and market conditions. the share repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through rule 10b5-1 plans, and may be suspended at any time. share repurchases by the firm are subject to regulatory non-objection.

performance-based stock units psus will vest and convert to shares of common stock only if the firm satisfies predetermined performance and market-based conditions over a three-year performance period. the number of psus that will vest ranges from 0% to 150% of the target award, based on the extent to which the firm achieves the specified performance goals. one-half of the award will be earned based on the firm's average return on equity, excluding certain adjustments specified in the plan terms ("ms adjusted roe"). the other half of the award will be earned based on the firm's total shareholder return, relative to the total shareholder return of the s&p 500 financials sector index ("relative ms tsr"). psus have vesting, restriction, forfeiture and cancellation provisions that are generally similar to those of rsus. at december 31, 2019, approximately 3 million psus were outstanding.

the u.s. qualified plan's assets represent 87% of the firm's total pension plan assets. the u.s. qualified plan uses a combination of active and risk-controlled fixed income investment strategies. the fixed income asset allocation consists primarily of fixed income securities and related derivative instruments designed to approximate the expected cash flows of the plan's liabilities in order to help reduce plan exposure to interest rate variation and to better align assets with the obligation. the longer-duration fixed income allocation is expected to help protect the plan's funded status and maintain the stability of plan contributions over the long run. the investment portfolio performance is assessed by comparing actual investment performance with changes in the estimated present value of the u.s. qualified plan's benefit obligation.
derivative instruments are permitted in the u.s. qualified plan's investment portfolio only to the extent that they comply with all of the plan's investment policy guidelines and are consistent with the plan's risk and return objectives.
as a fundamental operating principle, any restrictions on the underlying assets apply to a respective derivative product. this includes percentage allocations and credit quality. derivatives are used solely for the purpose of enhancing investment in the underlying assets and not to circumvent portfolio restrictions.
plan assets are measured at fair value using valuation techniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques applied to the firm's major categories of assets and liabilities as described in notes  and . otc derivative contracts consist of investments in interest rate swaps and total return swaps. other investments consist of pledged insurance annuity contracts held by non-u.s.-based plans. the pledged insurance annuity contracts are valued based on the premium reserve of the insurer for a guarantee that the insurer has given to the employee benefit plan that approximates fair value. the pledged insurance annuity contracts are categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
commingled trust funds are privately offered funds regulated, supervised and subject to periodic examination by a u.s. federal or state agency and available to institutional clients. the trust must be maintained for the collective investment or reinvestment of assets contributed to it from u.s. tax-qualified employee benefit plans maintained by more than one employer or controlled group of corporations. the sponsor of the commingled trust funds values the funds based on the fair value of the underlying securities. commingled trust funds are redeemable at nav at the measurement date or in the near future.
some non-u.s.-based plans hold foreign funds that consist of investments in fixed income funds, target cash flow funds and liquidity funds. fixed income funds invest in individual securities quoted on a recognized stock exchange or traded in a regulated market. certain fixed income funds aim to produce returns consistent with certain financial times stock exchange indexes. target cash flow funds are designed to provide a series of fixed annual cash flows achieved by investing in government bonds and derivatives. liquidity funds place a high priority on capital preservation, stable value and a high liquidity of assets. foreign funds are readily redeemable at nav.
the firm generally considers the nav of commingled trust funds and foreign funds provided by the fund manager to be the best estimate of fair value.
expected contributions the firm's policy is to fund at least the amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax laws. at december 31, 2019, the firm expected to contribute approximately $50 million to its pension and postretirement benefit plans in 2020 based upon the plans' current funded status and expected asset return assumptions for 2020.

the firm's effective tax rates for 2019 and 2018 include intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $348 million and $203 million, respectively, primarily associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest as a result of new information pertaining to multi-jurisdiction tax examinations.
the firm's effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2017 included an intermittent net discrete tax provision of $968 million, which included an approximate $1.2 billion provision primarily related to the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets as a result of the tax act, partially offset by $233 million of net discrete tax benefits primarily associated with the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year irs tax examinations.
the tax act, enacted on december 22, 2017, significantly revised u.s. corporate income tax law by reducing the corporate income tax rate to 21%, partially or wholly eliminating tax deductions for certain expenses and implementing a modified territorial tax system. the modified territorial tax system included a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries and also imposes a minimum tax on gilti and an alternative beat on u.s. corporations with operations outside the u.s.

deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse.
the firm believes the recognized net deferred tax assets (after valuation allowance) at december 31, 2019 are more likely than not to be realized based on expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested due to regulatory and other capital requirements in foreign jurisdictions. as a result of the tax act's one-time transition tax on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and an annual minimum tax on gilti, as of december 31, 2019 the unrecognized deferred tax liability attributable to indefinitely reinvested earnings is immaterial.

interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes. penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits for the years mentioned above were immaterial.
tax authority examinations the firm is under continuous examination by the irs and other tax authorities in certain countries, such as japan and the u.k., and in states and localities in which it has significant business operations, such as new york. the firm has established a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and associated interest, if applicable ("tax liabilities"), that it believes is adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. once established, the firm adjusts such tax liabilities only when new information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change.
the firm believes that the resolution of the above tax examinations will not have a material effect on the annual financial statements, although a resolution could have a material impact in the income statements and on the effective tax rate for any period in which such resolutions occur.
see note 13 regarding the dutch tax authority's challenge, in the district court in amsterdam (matters styled case number 15/3637 and case number 15/4353), of the firm's entitlement to certain withholding tax credits, which may impact the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.
it is reasonably possible that significant changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months. at this time, however, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the impact on the firm's effective tax rate over the next 12 months.

cross-border outstandings are based upon the ffiec regulatory guidelines for reporting cross-border information and represent the amounts that we may not be able to obtain from a foreign country due to country-specific events, including unfavorable economic and political conditions, economic and social instability, and changes in government policies. claims include cash, customer and other receivables, securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities borrowed and cash trading instruments, but exclude commitments. securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed are presented based on the domicile of the counterparty, without reduction for related securities collateral held. for information on the firm's country risk exposure, see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk-country and other risks."
there can be substantial differences between our cross-border risk exposure and our country risk exposure. for instance, unlike the country risk exposure, our cross-border risk exposure does not include the effect of certain risk mitigants. in addition, the basis for determining the domicile of the cross-border risk exposure is different from the basis for determining the country risk exposure. cross-border risk exposure is reported based on the country of jurisdiction for the obligor or guarantor. for country risk exposure, we consider factors in addition to that of
153     december 2019 form 10-k financial data supplement (unaudited)
country of jurisdiction, including physical location of operations or assets, location and source of cash flows or revenues and location of collateral (if applicable) in order to determine the basis for country risk exposure. furthermore, cross-border risk exposure incorporates cds only where protection is purchased, while country risk exposure incorporates cds where protection is purchased or sold.
the cross-border outstandings tables set forth cross-border outstandings for each country, excluding derivative exposure, in which cross-border outstandings exceed 1% of the firm's consolidated assets or 20% of the firm's total capital, whichever is less, in accordance with the ffiec guidelines.

controls and procedures conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of the firm's management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the firm conducted an evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under exchange act rule 13a-15(e). based on this evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the firm's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting the firm's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. the firm's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america ("u.s. gaap").
the internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
•   pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the firm;
•   provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the firm's management and directors; and
•   provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of firm assets that could have a material effect on the firm's financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
management assessed the effectiveness of the firm's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2019. in making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ("coso") in internal control-integrated framework (2013). based on management's assessment and those criteria, management believes that the firm maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2019.
the firm's independent registered public accounting firm has audited and issued a report on the firm's internal control over financial reporting, which appears below.
157     december 2019 form 10-k report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and the board of directors of morgan stanley:
opinion on internal control over financial reporting we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of morgan stanley and subsidiaries (the "firm") as of december 31, 2019, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). in our opinion, the firm maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2019, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by coso.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the consolidated financial statements of the firm as of and for the year ended december 31, 2019 and our report dated february 27, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
basis for opinion the firm's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the firm's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the firm in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

other information on february 26, 2020, the firm announced that paul c. wirth would step down from his position as deputy chief financial officer and controller of the firm in may 2020. after that date, mr. wirth will become a senior advisor in the finance division reporting to the chief financial officer.
on february 27, 2020, the firm announced that raja j. akram, age 47, will become deputy chief financial officer, chief accounting officer and controller of the firm in may 2020.
beginning in november 2017, mr. akram was controller and chief accounting officer of citigroup inc. since 2006, mr. akram held a number of roles in citigroup inc., including deputy controller, head of the finance group's corporate accounting policy team supporting m&a activities, and brazil country finance officer.
for 2020, mr. akram will receive a base salary of $600,000 and a year-end bonus of $4,400,000 that is payable in a combination of cash and deferred incentive compensation. upon commencement of employment, mr. akram will receive incoming awards in the form of a one-time cash payment, a one-time deferred cash award, and a one-time restricted stock unit award with an aggregate value of $5,000,000. deferred incentive compensation awards, including deferred cash and restricted stock units, are subject to the terms and conditions of the governing award documentation, including vesting and cancellation conditions. in the event that mr. akram's employment offer is withdrawn by the firm, with limited exceptions, or his employment is terminated by the firm without cause, he is entitled to severance in an amount equal to his 2020 base salary and the value of any portion of the 2020 year-end bonus and incoming awards that have not yet been paid or awarded.
unresolved staff comments the firm, like other well-known seasoned issuers, from time to time receives written comments from the staff of the sec regarding its periodic or current reports under the exchange act. there are no comments that remain unresolved that the firm received not less than 180 days before the end of the year to which this report relates that the firm believes are material.
properties we have offices, operations and data centers located around the world. our global headquarters and principal executive offices are located at 1585 broadway, new york, new york. our other principal offices include locations in manhattan and the greater new york metropolitan area, london, hong kong and tokyo. our current facilities are adequate for our present and future operations for each of our business segments, although we may add regional offices, depending upon our future operations.
legal proceedings in addition to the matters described below, in the normal course of business, the firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. in some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress.
the firm is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the firm's business, and involving, among other matters, sales and trading activities, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by the firm, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.
the firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the firm accrues the estimated loss by a charge to income. the firm's future legal expenses may fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment regarding government investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the firm.
in many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible, or to estimate the amount of any loss. the firm cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings or investigations will be resolved or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the
159     december 2019 form 10-k calculation of damages or other relief, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question, before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation. subject to the foregoing, the firm believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such proceedings and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the firm, although the outcome of such proceedings or investigations could be material to the firm's operating results and cash flows for a particular period depending on, among other things, the level of the firm's revenues or income for such period.
while the firm has identified below certain proceedings that the firm believes to be material, individually or collectively, there can be no assurance that additional material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be material.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources."
legal and compliance risk legal and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, including fines, penalties, judgments, damages and/or settlements, or loss to reputation that we may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. this risk also includes contractual and commercial risk, such as the risk that a counterparty's performance obligations will be unenforceable. it also includes compliance with aml, terrorist financing, and anti-corruption rules and regulations. we are generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business (see also "business-supervision and regulation" and "risk factors").
we have established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to facilitate compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and to require that our policies relating to business conduct, ethics and practices are followed globally. in addition, we have established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterparty's performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. the heightened legal and regulatory focus on the financial services and banking industries globally presents a continuing business challenge for us.

financial statements and supplementary data report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and the board of directors of morgan stanley:
opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of morgan stanley and subsidiaries (the "firm") as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated income statements, comprehensive income statements, cash flow statements and statements of changes in total equity for each of the three years ended december 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). in our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the firm as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years ended december 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the firm's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2019, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated february 27, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the firm's internal control over financial reporting.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the firm's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the firm's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the firm in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matter the critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
valuation of level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value - refer to note 3 to the financial statements critical audit matter description the firm's trading and financing activities result in the firm carrying material financial instruments having limited price transparency. these financial instruments can span a broad array of product types and generally include derivative, security and lending positions, as well as borrowings carried at fair value. these financial instruments are generally classified as level 3 financial assets or liabilities in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.
unlike financial instruments whose values or inputs are readily observable and therefore more easily independently corroborated, the valuation of financial instruments classified as level 3 is inherently subjective, and often involves the use of proprietary valuation models whose underlying algorithms and valuation methodologies are complex.
75      december 2019 form 10-k given the firm uses complex valuation models and model inputs that are not observable in the marketplace to determine the fair value of level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, performing audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of these models and inputs involved a high degree of auditor judgment, specialized skills, and an increased extent of testing.
how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit
•   we tested the design and operating effectiveness of the firm's valuation controls, including model review and price verification for the appropriateness of valuation methodology including inputs and assumptions used.
•   we independently evaluated the appropriateness of management's significant valuation methodologies, including the input assumptions, considering the expected assumptions of other market participants, and external data, when available.
•   we developed independent valuation estimates for certain financial instrument selections, using externally sourced inputs and independent valuation models, and used such estimates to further evaluate management's fair value measurement by investigating the differences exceeding established thresholds between our estimate and that of the firm, including; comparing the fair value estimate with similar transactions; and, evaluating the firm's assumptions inclusive of the inputs.
•   we tested the revenues arising from the valuation estimate on trade date for certain structured transactions involving level 3 financial instruments. in performing such procedures, we also developed independent valuation estimates for certain structured transaction selections, as well as tested the valuation assumptions and methodologies used by the company. those procedures also included evaluating whether the methods were consistent with relevant company valuation policies and agreeing relevant cash flows to underlying support.
•   we assessed the consistency by which management has applied significant and unobservable valuation assumptions.
•   we performed a retrospective assessment of management's valuation estimates for a sample of financial instrument selections by comparing such estimates to relevant transactions.

a description of the clients and principal products and services of each of the firm's business segments is as follows:
institutional securities provides investment banking, sales and trading, lending and other services to corporations, governments, financial institutions and high to ultra-high net worth clients. investment banking services consist of capital raising and financial advisory services, including services relating to the underwriting of debt, equity and other securities, as well as advice on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, real estate and project finance. sales and trading services include sales, financing, prime brokerage and market-making activities in equity and fixed income products, including foreign exchange and commodities. lending activities include originating corporate loans and commercial real estate loans, providing secured lending facilities, and extending financing to sales and trading customers. other activities include asia wealth management services, investments and research.

investment management provides a broad range of investment strategies and products that span geographies, asset classes, and public and private markets to a diverse group of clients across institutional and intermediary channels. strategies and products, which are offered through a variety of investment vehicles, include equity, fixed income, liquidity and alternative/other products. institutional clients include defined benefit/defined contribution plans, foundations, endowments, government entities, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and corporations. individual clients are generally served through intermediaries, including affiliated and non-affiliated distributors.
basis of financial information the financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires the firm to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of certain financial instruments, the valuations of goodwill and intangible assets, compensation, deferred tax assets, the outcome of legal and tax matters, allowance for credit losses, and other matters that affect its financial statements and related disclosures. the firm believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of its financial statements are prudent and reasonable. actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to the current presentation. the notes are an integral part of the firm's financial statements. the firm has evaluated subsequent events for adjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements through the date of this report and has not identified any recordable or disclosable events not otherwise reported in these financial statements or the notes thereto.
consolidation the financial statements include the accounts of the firm, its wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest, including certain vies (see note 14). intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. for consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as noncontrolling interests. the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as net income applicable to noncontrolling interests in the income statements. the portion of shareholders' equity that is attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as noncontrolling interests, a component of total equity, in the balance sheets.
for entities where the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support and the equity holders bear the economic residual risks and returns of the entity and have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly affect its economic performance, the firm consolidates those entities it controls either through a majority voting interest or otherwise. for vies (i.e., entities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria), the firm consolidates those entities where it has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the vie and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie.

notes to consolidated financial statements for investments in entities in which the firm does not have a controlling financial interest but has significant influence over operating and financial decisions, it applies the equity method of accounting with net gains and losses recorded within other revenues (see note 10) unless the firm has elected to measure the investment at fair value, in which case net gains and losses are recorded within investments revenues (see note 3).
equity and partnership interests held by entities qualifying for accounting purposes as investment companies are carried at fair value.
the firm's significant regulated u.s. and international subsidiaries include morgan stanley & co. llc ("ms&co."), morgan stanley smith barney llc ("mssb"), morgan stanley & co. international plc ("msip"), morgan stanley mufg securities co., ltd. ("msms"), morgan stanley bank, n.a. ("msbna") and morgan stanley private bank, national association ("mspbna").

. significant accounting policies revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the promised goods or services are delivered to our customers, in an amount that is based on the consideration the firm expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services when such amounts are not probable of significant reversal. these policies reflect the adoption of revenue from contracts with customers on january 1, 2018. please see "accounting updates adopted" herein for the more significant differences in policies applied in prior periods.
investment banking revenues from investment banking activities consist of revenues earned from underwriting, primarily equity and fixed income securities and loan syndications, and advisory fees, primarily for mergers, acquisitions and restructurings.
underwriting revenues are generally recognized on trade date if there is no uncertainty or contingency related to the amount to be paid. underwriting costs are deferred and recognized in the relevant non-interest expenses line items when the related underwriting revenues are recorded.
advisory fees are recognized as advice is provided to the client, based on the estimated progress of work and when revenues are not probable of a significant reversal. advisory costs are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest expenses line items, including those reimbursed.
commissions and fees commission and fee revenues result from transaction-based arrangements in which the client is charged a fee for the execution of transactions. such revenues primarily arise from transactions in equity securities; services related to sales and trading activities; and sales of mutual funds, alternative funds, futures, insurance products and options. commission and fee revenues are recognized on trade date when the performance obligation is satisfied.
asset management revenues asset management, distribution and administration fees are generally based on related asset levels being managed, such as the aum of a customer's account or the net asset value of a fund. these fees are generally recognized when services are performed and the fees become known. management fees are reduced by estimated fee waivers and expense caps, if any, provided to the customer.
performance-based fees not in the form of carried interest are recorded when the annual performance target is met and the revenues are not probable of a significant reversal.
sales commissions paid by the firm in connection with the sale of certain classes of shares of its open-end mutual fund products are accounted for as deferred commission assets and amortized to expense over the expected life of the contract. the firm periodically tests deferred commission assets for recoverability based on cash flows expected to be received in future periods. other asset management and distribution costs are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest expenses line items.
carried interest the firm is entitled to receive performance-based fees in the form of carried interest when the return in certain funds exceeds specified performance targets. when the firm earns carried interest from funds as specified performance thresholds are met, that carried interest and any related general or limited partner interest is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and measured based on the firm's claim on the nav of the fund at the reporting date, taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held.
see note 21 for information regarding the net cumulative unrealized amount of performance-based fee revenues at risk of
83      december 2019 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements reversal. see note 13 for information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received.
other items revenues from certain commodities-related contracts are recognized as the promised goods or services are delivered to the customer.
receivables from contracts with customers are recognized in customer and other receivables in the balance sheets when the underlying performance obligations have been satisfied and the firm has the right per the contract to bill the customer. contract assets are recognized in other assets when the firm has satisfied its performance obligations but customer payment is conditional. contract liabilities are recognized in other liabilities when the firm has collected payment from a customer based on the terms of the contract, but the underlying performance obligations are not yet satisfied.
for contracts with a term of less than one year, incremental costs to obtain the contract are expensed as incurred. revenues are not discounted when payment is expected within one year.
the firm presents, net within revenues, all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by the firm from a customer.
fair value of financial instruments instruments within trading assets and trading liabilities are measured at fair value, either as required or allowed by accounting guidance. these financial instruments primarily represent the firm's trading and investment positions and include both cash and derivative products. in addition, securities classified as afs are measured at fair value.
gains and losses on instruments carried at fair value are reflected in trading revenues, investments revenues or investment banking revenues in the income statements, except for afs securities (see "investment securities-afs and htm securities" section herein and note 6) and derivatives accounted for as hedges (see "hedge accounting" herein and note 5).
interest income and interest expense are recorded within the income statements depending on the nature of the instrument and related market conventions. when interest is included as a component of the instruments' fair value, interest is included within trading revenues or investments revenues. otherwise, it is included within interest income or interest expense. dividend income is recorded in trading revenues or investments revenues depending on the business activity.
the fair value of otc financial instruments, including derivative contracts related to financial instruments and commodities, is presented in the accompanying balance sheets on a net-by-counterparty basis, when appropriate. additionally, the firm nets the fair value of cash collateral paid or received against the fair value amounts recognized for net derivative positions executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement.
fair value option the firm has elected to measure certain eligible instruments at fair value, including securities purchased under agreements to resell, loans and lending commitments, equity method investments and certain other assets, deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, other secured financings and borrowings.
fair value measurement-definition and hierarchy fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, assumptions are set to reflect those that the firm believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. where the firm manages a group of financial assets, financial liabilities, and nonfinancial items accounted for as derivatives on the basis of its net exposure to either market risks or credit risk, the firm measures the fair value of that group of financial instruments consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.
in determining fair value, the firm uses various valuation approaches and establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that requires the most observable inputs be used when available.
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that were developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the firm. unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect assumptions the firm believes other market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. the fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the observability of inputs as follows, with level 1 being the highest and level 3 being the lowest level:

notes to consolidated financial statements valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
level 2.    valuations based on one or more quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
level 3.    valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
the availability of observable inputs can vary from product to product and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of product, whether the product is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the product. to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the firm in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
the firm considers prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocation. in periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. this condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from level 1 to level 2 or from level 2 to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. in such cases, the total fair value amount is disclosed in the level appropriate for the lowest level input that is significant to the total fair value of the asset or liability.
valuation techniques many cash instruments and otc derivative contracts have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. bid prices reflect the highest price that a party is willing to pay for an asset. ask prices represent the lowest price that a party is willing to accept for an asset. the firm carries positions at the point within the bid-ask range that meets its best estimate of fair value. for offsetting positions in the same financial instrument, the same price within the bid-ask spread is used to measure both the long and short positions.
fair value for many cash instruments and otc derivative contracts is derived using pricing models. pricing models take into account the contract terms, as well as multiple inputs, including, where applicable, commodity prices, equity prices, interest rate yield curves, credit curves, correlation, creditworthiness of the counterparty, creditworthiness of the firm, option volatility and currency rates.
where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty and concentration risk and funding. adjustments for liquidity risk adjust model-derived mid-market amounts of level 2 and level 3 financial instruments for the bid-mid or mid-ask spread required to properly reflect the exit price of a risk position. bid-mid and mid-ask spreads are marked to levels observed in trade activity, broker quotes or other external third-party data. where these spreads are unobservable for the particular position in question, spreads are derived from observable levels of similar positions.
the firm applies credit-related valuation adjustments to its borrowings for which the fair value option was elected and to otc derivatives. the firm considers the impact of changes in its own credit spreads based upon observations of the secondary bond market spreads when measuring the fair value for borrowings.
for otc derivatives, the impact of changes in both the firm's and the counterparty's credit rating is considered when measuring fair value. in determining the expected exposure, the firm simulates the distribution of the future exposure to a counterparty, then applies market-based default probabilities to the future exposure, leveraging external third-party cds spread data. where cds spread data are unavailable for a specific counterparty, bond market spreads, cds spread data based on the counterparty's credit rating or cds spread data that reference a comparable counterparty may be utilized. the firm also considers collateral held and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate its exposure to each counterparty.
adjustments for model uncertainty are taken for positions whose underlying models are reliant on significant inputs that are neither directly nor indirectly observable, hence requiring reliance on established theoretical concepts in their derivation. these adjustments are derived by making assessments of the possible degree of variability using statistical approaches and market-based information where possible.
the firm may apply concentration adjustments to certain of its otc derivative portfolios to reflect the additional cost of closing out a particularly large risk exposure. where possible, these adjustments are based on observable market information, but in many instances, significant judgment is required to estimate the costs of closing out concentrated risk exposures due to the lack of liquidity in the marketplace.
the firm applies an fva in the fair value measurements of otc uncollateralized or partially collateralized derivatives and in collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the reuse of the collateral received. in general, fva reflects a market funding risk premium inherent in the noted derivative instruments. the methodology for measuring fva leverages the firm's existing credit-related valuation adjustment calculation methodologies, which apply to both assets and liabilities.
85      december 2019 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements see note 3 for a description of valuation techniques applied to the major categories of financial instruments measured at fair value.
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis certain of the firm's assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. the firm incurs losses or gains for any adjustments of these assets or liabilities to fair value.
for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, fair value is determined by using various valuation approaches. the same hierarchy for inputs as described above, which requires that observable inputs be used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these items.
for further information on financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis, see note 3.
offsetting of derivative instruments in connection with its derivative activities, the firm generally enters into master netting agreements and collateral agreements with its counterparties. these agreements provide the firm with the right, in the event of a default by the counterparty, to net a counterparty's rights and obligations under the agreement and to liquidate and set off cash collateral against any net amount owed by the counterparty. derivatives with enforceable master netting agreements are reported net of cash collateral received and posted.
however, in certain circumstances, the firm may not have such an agreement in place; the relevant insolvency regime may not support the enforceability of the master netting agreement or collateral agreement; or the firm may not have sought legal advice to support the enforceability of the agreement. in cases where the firm has not determined an agreement to be enforceable, the related amounts are not offset (see note 5).
the firm's policy is generally to receive securities and cash posted as collateral (with rights of rehypothecation), irrespective of the enforceability determination regarding the master netting and collateral agreement. in certain cases, the firm may agree for such collateral to be posted to a third-party custodian under a control agreement that enables it to take control of such collateral in the event of a counterparty default. the enforceability of the master netting agreement is taken into account in the firm's risk management practices and application of counterparty credit limits.
for information related to offsetting of derivatives and certain collateralized transactions, see notes 5 and 7, respectively.
hedge accounting the firm applies hedge accounting using various derivative financial instruments for the following types of hedges: hedges of changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to the risk being hedged (fair value hedges); and hedges of net investments in foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the reporting currency of the parent company (net investment hedges). these financial instruments are included within trading assets-derivative and other contracts or trading liabilities-derivative and other contracts in the balance sheets. for hedges where hedge accounting is being applied, the firm performs effectiveness testing and other procedures.
fair value hedges-interest rate risk the firm's designated fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps designated as hedges of changes in the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate afs securities and senior borrowings. in the fourth quarter of 2019, the firm also began designating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of changes in the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate deposits. the firm is permitted to hedge the full, or part of the, contractual term of the hedged instrument. the firm uses regression analysis to perform an ongoing prospective and retrospective assessment of the effectiveness of these hedging relationships. a hedging relationship is deemed effective if the change in fair value of the hedging instrument (derivative) and the change in fair value of the hedged item (afs security, deposit liability or borrowing), due to changes in the benchmark interest rate, offset within a range of 80% to 125%. the firm considers the impact of valuation adjustments related to counterparty credit spreads and its own credit spreads to determine whether they would cause the hedging relationship to be ineffective.
for qualifying fair value hedges of benchmark interest rates, the change in the fair value of the derivative, offset by the change in the fair value attributable to the change in the benchmark interest rate risk of the hedged asset (liability), is recognized in earnings each period as a component of interest income (expense). for afs securities, the change in fair value of the hedged item due to changes other than the risk being hedged will continue to be reported in oci. when a derivative is de-designated as a hedge, any basis adjustment remaining on the hedged asset (liability) is amortized to interest income (expense) over the remaining life of the asset (liability) using the effective interest method.

notes to consolidated financial statements the functional currency of the investee and the intermediate parent entity's functional currency, it is considered to be perfectly effective, with no income statement recognition. if these exchange rates are not the same, the firm uses regression analysis to assess the prospective and retrospective effectiveness of the hedge relationships. the gain or loss from revaluing hedges of net investments in foreign operations at the spot rate is reported within aoci. the forward points on the hedging instruments are excluded from hedge effectiveness testing and changes in the fair value of this excluded component are recorded currently in interest income.
for further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities, see note 5.
investment securities-available-for-sale and held-to-maturity afs securities are reported at fair value in the balance sheets with unrealized gains and losses reported in aoci, net of tax, unless such securities are designated in a fair value hedge. interest income, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is included in interest income in the income statements. realized gains and losses on sales of afs securities are classified within other revenues in the income statements (see note 6). the firm utilizes the "first-in, first-out" method as the basis for determining the cost of afs securities.
htm securities are reported at amortized cost in the balance sheets. interest income, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on htm securities, is included in interest income in the income statements.
otti afs securities and htm securities with a current fair value less than their amortized cost are analyzed as part of the firm's periodic assessment of temporary versus otti at the individual security level. a temporary impairment is recognized in aoci for afs securities. otti is recognized in the income statements with the exception of the non-credit portion related to a security that the firm does not intend to sell and is not likely to be required to sell, which is recognized in aoci.
for afs securities that the firm either has the intent to sell or that the firm is likely to be required to sell before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the impairment is considered otti.
for those afs securities that the firm does not have the intent to sell or is not likely to be required to sell, and for all htm securities, the firm evaluates whether it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. if the firm does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of those afs or htm securities, the impairment is considered otti, and the firm determines what portion of the impairment relates to a credit loss and what portion relates to non-credit factors.
a credit loss exists if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected (discounted at the implicit interest rate at acquisition of the security or discounted at the effective yield for securities that incorporate changes in prepayment assumptions) is less than the amortized cost basis of the security. changes in prepayment assumptions alone are not considered to result in a credit loss.
when determining if a credit loss exists, the firm considers relevant information, including:
•   the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis;
•   adverse conditions specifically related to the security, its industry or geographic area;
•   changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security, the presence of explicit or implicit guarantees of repayment by the u.s. government for u.s. government and agency securities or, in the case of an asset-backed debt security, changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors;
•   the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security;
•   the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future;
•   failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments;
•   the current rating and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency;
•   recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
when estimating the present value of expected cash flows, information utilized includes the remaining payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, financial condition of the issuer(s), expected defaults and the value of any underlying collateral.
loans the firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: loans held for investment; loans held for sale; and loans at fair value.
loans held for investment loans held for investment are reported at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses, any unamortized deferred fees or costs for originated loans, and any unamortized premiums or discounts for purchased loans.
87      december 2019 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements interest income.    interest income on performing loans held for investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the life of the loan to produce a level rate of return.
allowance for loan losses.    the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of probable losses related to loans specifically identified for impairment in addition to the probable losses inherent in the held-for-investment loan portfolio.
the firm utilizes the u.s. banking agencies' definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss categories as credit quality indicators. for further information on the credit quality indicators, see note 8. substandard loans are regularly reviewed for impairment. factors considered by management when determining impairment include payment status, fair value of collateral, and probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. the impairment analysis required depends on the nature and type of loans. loans classified as doubtful or loss are considered impaired.
there are two components of the allowance for loan losses: the specific allowance component and the inherent allowance component.
the specific allowance component of the allowance for loan losses is used to estimate probable losses for exposures that have been specifically identified for impairment analysis by the firm and determined to be impaired. when a loan is specifically identified for impairment, the impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. a loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the sale or operation of the underlying collateral. if the present value of the expected future cash flows (or alternatively, the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral) is less than the recorded investment in the loan, then the firm recognizes an allowance and a charge to the provision for loan losses within other revenues.
the inherent allowance component of the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and includes loans that have not been identified as impaired. the firm maintains methodologies by loan product for calculating an allowance for loan losses that estimates the inherent losses in the loan portfolio. generally, inherent losses in the portfolio for non-impaired loans are estimated using statistical analysis and judgment regarding the exposure at default, the probability of default and the loss given default.
qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio, and lending terms and volume and severity of past due loans may also be considered in the calculations. the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level to ensure that it is reasonably likely to adequately absorb the estimated probable losses inherent in the portfolio. when the firm recognizes an allowance, there is also a charge to the provision for loan losses within other revenues.
troubled debt restructurings.    the firm may modify the terms of certain loans for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulties by granting one or more concessions that the firm would not otherwise consider. such modifications are accounted for and reported as a tdr. a loan that has been modified in a tdr is generally considered to be impaired and is evaluated for the extent of impairment using the firm's specific allowance methodology. tdrs are also generally classified as nonaccrual and may be returned to accrual status only after considering the borrower's sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period.
nonaccrual loans.    the firm places loans on nonaccrual status if principal or interest is past due for a period of 90 days or more or payment of principal or interest is in doubt unless the obligation is well-secured and in the process of collection. a loan is considered past due when a payment due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement has not been remitted by the borrower. substandard loans, if identified as impaired, are categorized as nonaccrual, as are loans classified as doubtful or loss.
payments received on nonaccrual loans held for investment are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of principal. if collection of the principal of nonaccrual loans held for investment is not in doubt, interest income is realized on a cash basis. if neither principal nor interest collection is in doubt, loans are placed on accrual status and interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. loans that are on nonaccrual status may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent principal and/or interest has been brought current after a reasonable period of performance, typically a minimum of six months.
charge-offs.    the firm charges off a loan in the period that it is deemed uncollectible and records a reduction in the allowance for loan losses and the balance of the loan. in general, any portion of the recorded investment in a collateral dependent loan (including any capitalized accrued interest, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized premium or discount) in excess of the fair value of the collateral that can be identified as uncollectible, and is therefore deemed a confirmed loss, is charged off against the allowance for loan losses. in addition, for loan transfers from loans held for investment to loans held for sale, at the time of transfer any reduction in the loan value is reflected as a charge-off of the recorded investment, resulting in a new cost basis.

notes to consolidated financial statements lending commitments.    the firm records the liability and related expense for the credit exposure related to commitments to fund loans that will be held for investment in a manner similar to outstanding loans discussed above. the analysis also incorporates a credit conversion factor, which is the expected utilization of the undrawn commitment. the liability and expense for the credit exposure are recorded in other liabilities and accrued expenses in the balance sheets, and other non-interest expenses in the income statements, respectively. for more information regarding loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, see note 13.
loans held for sale loans held for sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in other revenues. the firm determines the valuation allowance on an individual loan basis, except for residential mortgage loans for which the valuation allowance is determined at the loan product level. any decreases in fair value below the initial carrying amount and any recoveries in fair value up to the initial carrying amount are recorded in other revenues. increases in fair value above initial carrying value are not recognized.
interest income on loans held for sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred as an adjustment to the loan's cost basis until the related loan is sold and, as such, are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.
lending commitments. commitments to fund mortgage loans held for sale are derivatives and are reported in trading assets or trading liabilities in the balance sheets with an offset to trading revenues in the income statements.
for commitments to fund non-mortgage loans the firm records the liability and related expense for the fair value exposure below cost of such commitments in other liabilities and accrued expenses in the balance sheets with an offset to other revenues in the income statements.
loans and lending commitments held for sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above in the loans held for investment-nonaccrual loans section. because loans and lending commitments held for sale are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies does not apply to these loans.
loans at fair value loans for which the fair value option is elected are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. loans carried at fair value are not evaluated for purposes of recording an allowance for loan losses. for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets and trading liabilities, see note 3.
lending commitments. the firm records the liability and related expense for the fair value exposure related to commitments to fund loans that will be measured at fair value. the liability is recorded in trading liabilities in the balance sheets, and the expense is recorded in trading revenues in the income statements.
loans and lending commitments at fair value are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above in the loans held for investment-nonaccrual loans section. because such loans and lending commitments are reported at fair value, the allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans.
for further information on loans, see note 8.
transfers of financial assets transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when the firm has relinquished control over the transferred assets. any related gain or loss on sale is recorded in net revenues. transfers that are not accounted for as sales are treated as collateralized financings. securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financings (see note 7).
securities purchased under agreements to resell ("reverse repurchase agreements") and securities sold under agreements to repurchase ("repurchase agreements") are carried in the balance sheets at the amount of cash paid or received, plus accrued interest, except for certain reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements for which the firm has elected the fair value option (see note 4). where appropriate, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. securities borrowed and securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received.
in instances where the firm is the lender in securities-for-securities transactions and is permitted to sell or repledge these securities, the fair value of the collateral received is reported in trading assets, and the related obligation to return the collateral is reported in trading liabilities in the balance sheets. securities-for-securities transactions where the firm is the borrower are not included in the balance sheets.
premises, equipment and software costs premises, equipment and software costs consist of buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, computer and communications equipment, power generation assets and software (externally purchased and developed for internal use). premises, equipment and software costs are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and are included in
89      december 2019 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements other assets in the balance sheets. depreciation and amortization are provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.
estimated useful lives of assets in years                                estimated useful life buildings                                                  39

computer and communications equipment                  3 to 9
power generation assets                              15 to 29
software costs                                        2 to 10
premises, equipment and software costs are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
goodwill and intangible assets the firm tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. the firm tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below its business segments. for both the annual and interim tests, the firm has the option to either (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative test would be performed.
when performing a quantitative impairment test, the firm compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
the estimated fair values of the reporting units are derived based on valuation techniques the firm believes market participants would use for each respective reporting unit. the estimated fair values are generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable companies.
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when impairment indicators are present. impairment losses are recorded within other expenses in the income statements.
earnings per common share basic eps is computed by dividing earnings available to morgan stanley common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. earnings available to morgan stanley common shareholders represents net income applicable to morgan stanley reduced by preferred stock dividends. common shares outstanding include common stock and vested rsus where recipients have satisfied either the explicit vesting terms or retirement-eligibility requirements. diluted eps reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities.
share-based awards that pay dividend equivalents subject to vesting are included in diluted shares outstanding (if dilutive) under the treasury stock method.
the firm has granted psus that vest and convert to shares of common stock only if predetermined performance and market goals are satisfied. since the issuance of the shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, the psus are included in diluted eps based on the number of shares (if any) that would be issuable if the end of the reporting period was the end of the contingency period.
for further information on diluted earnings (loss) per common share, see note 16 to the financial statements.
deferred compensation stock-based compensation the firm measures compensation expense for stock-based awards at fair value. the firm determines the fair value of rsus (including psus with non-market performance conditions) based on the grant-date fair value of its common stock, measured as the volume-weighted average price on the date of grant ("vwap"). the fair value of rsus not entitled to dividends until conversion is measured at vwap reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares prior to scheduled conversion date. psus that contain market-based conditions are valued using a monte carlo valuation model.
compensation expense is recognized over the relevant vesting period for each separate vesting portion of the award. compensation expense for awards with performance conditions is recognized based on the probable outcome of the performance condition at each reporting date. compensation expense for awards with market-based conditions is recognized irrespective of the probability of the market condition being achieved and is not reversed if the market condition is not met. the firm accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
stock-based awards generally contain claw back and cancellation provisions. certain awards provide the firm discretion to claw back or cancel all or a portion of the award under specified circumstances. compensation expense for those awards is adjusted for changes in the fair value of the firm's common stock or the relevant model valuation, as appropriate, until conversion, exercise or expiration.

notes to consolidated financial statements employee stock trusts in connection with certain stock-based compensation plans, the firm, at its discretion, has established employee stock trusts to provide common stock voting rights to certain employees who hold outstanding rsus. the assets of the employee stock trusts are consolidated with those of the firm and are generally accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock, where the shares of common stock outstanding reported in common stock issued to employee stock trusts are offset by an equal amount reported in employee stock trusts in the balance sheets.
the firm uses the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation as the basis for recognition of the assets in the employee stock trusts. subsequent changes in the fair value are not recognized as the firm's stock-based compensation plans must be settled by delivery of a fixed number of shares of the firm's common stock.
deferred cash-based compensation compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation plans is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments that employees select. compensation expense is recognized over the relevant vesting period for each separate vesting portion of deferred awards. compensation expense for these awards is adjusted based on notional earnings of the referenced investments until distribution.
the firm invests directly, as a principal, in financial instruments or other investments to economically hedge its obligations under its deferred cash-based compensation plans. changes in the value of such investments made by the firm are recorded in trading revenues and investments revenues. although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the firm, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the firm's investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period.
retirement-eligible employee compensation for year-end stock-based awards and deferred cash-based compensation awards anticipated to be granted to retirement-eligible employees under award terms that do not contain a future service requirement, the firm accrues the estimated cost of the awards over the course of the calendar year preceding the grant date, which reflects the period over which the compensation is earned.
carried interest compensation the firm generally recognizes compensation expense for any portion of carried interest (both realized and unrealized) that is allocated to employees. for information on performance-based fees in the form of carried interest, which are directly related to carried interest compensation, see "revenue recognition-carried interest" herein.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based upon the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax expense (benefit) in the period that includes the enactment date. such effects are recorded in income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations regardless of where deferred taxes were originally recorded.
the firm recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. in making such a determination, the firm considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and results of recent operations. when performing the assessment, the firm considers all types of deferred tax assets in combination with each other, regardless of the origin of the underlying temporary difference. if a deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. if the firm subsequently determines that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount, it would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
the firm recognizes tax expense associated with gilti included in the tax cuts and jobs act ("tax act") as it is incurred as part of the current income taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period.
uncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process, whereby (i) the firm determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those tax positions that meet this threshold, the firm recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.
foreign currencies assets and liabilities of operations with non-u.s. dollar functional currencies are translated at year-end rates of
91      december 2019 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements exchange. gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements, net of hedge gains or losses and related tax effects, are reflected in aoci in the balance sheets. gains or losses resulting from remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are included in net income, and amounts recognized in the income statement are translated at the rate of exchange on the respective date of recognition for each amount.
accounting updates adopted in 2019
see note 16 for a summary of the retained earnings impact of these adoptions.
leases upon the adoption of leases, the firm began recognizing in the balance sheet leases with terms exceeding one year as right-of-use ("rou") assets and corresponding liabilities. the adoption resulted in an increase to retained earnings of approximately $63 million, net of tax, related to deferred revenue from previously recorded sale-leaseback transactions. at transition on january 1, 2019, the adoption also resulted in a balance sheet gross-up of approximately $4 billion reflected in other assets and other liabilities and accrued expenses. see note 10 for lease disclosures, including amounts reflected in the december 31, 2019 balance sheet. prior period amounts were not restated.
as allowed by the guidance, the firm elected not to reassess the following at transition: whether existing contracts are or contain leases; and for existing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs. in addition, the firm continues to account for existing land easements as service contracts.
both at transition and for new leases thereafter, rou assets and lease liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, including non-lease components such as fixed common area maintenance costs and other fixed costs such as real estate taxes and insurance.
the discount rates used in determining the present value of leases are the firm's incremental borrowing rates, developed based upon each lease's term and currency of payment. the lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the firm will exercise that option. for operating leases, the rou assets also include any prepaid lease payments and initial direct costs incurred and are reduced by lease incentives. for these leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term if the rou asset has not been impaired or abandoned.
derivatives and hedging (asu 2018-16)
the amendments in this update permit use of the ois rate based on the secured overnight financing rate as a u.s. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. the firm adopted this update on a prospective basis for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships. this update did not impact the firm's pre-existing hedges.
accounting update adopted in 2018
see note 16 for a summary of the retained earnings impact of this adoption.
revenue recognition the firm adopted revenues from contracts with customers using the modified retrospective method. our revenue recognition policies are reflective of this update since adoption, while 2017 revenues and expenses remain as presented under the prior accounting policy.
the more significant differences to the accounting policy in place prior to adoption were: (i) the presentation of certain costs related to underwriting and advisory activities in that such costs were recorded net of investment banking revenues versus the current practice of recording the costs in the relevant non-compensation expense line item; (ii) the presentation of certain costs related to the selling and distribution of investment funds in that such costs were recorded net of asset management revenues versus the current practice of recording the costs in the relevant non-compensation expense line item; (iii) the recognition of certain performance-based fees from fund management activities not in the form of carried interest that were recognized quarterly versus the current practice of deferring the revenues until the fees are not probable of a significant reversal, and; (iv) the timing of the recognition of advisory fees in that such fees were recorded when realizable versus the current practice of recognizing the fees as advice is provided to the client, based on the estimated progress of work and when the revenue is not probable of a significant reversal.

• mortgage- and asset-backed securities may be valued based on price or spread data obtained from observed transactions or independent external parties such as vendors or brokers.• when position-specific external price data are not observable, the fair value determination may require benchmarking to comparable instruments, and/or analyzing expected credit losses, default and recovery rates, and/or applying discounted cash flow techniques. when evaluating the comparable instruments for use in the valuation of each security, security collateral-specific attributes, including payment priority, credit enhancement levels, type of collateral, delinquency rates and loss severity, are considered. in addition, for rmbs borrowers, fico scores and the level of documentation for the loan are considered.• market standard cash flow models may be utilized to model the specific collateral composition and cash flow structure of each transaction. key inputs to these models are market spreads, forecasted credit losses, and default and prepayment rates for each asset category.• valuation levels of rmbs and cmbs indices are used as an additional data point for benchmarking purposes or to price outright index positions.

• otc derivative contracts include forward, swap and option contracts related to interest rates, foreign currencies, credit standing of reference entities, equity prices or commodity prices.• depending on the product and the terms of the transaction, the fair value of otc derivative products can be modeled using a series of techniques, including closed-form analytic formulas, such as the black-scholes option-pricing model, simulation models or a combination thereof. many pricing models do not entail material subjectivity as the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant judgment since model inputs may be observed from actively quoted markets, as is the case for generic interest rate swaps, many equity, commodity and foreign currency option contracts, and certain cds. in the case of more established derivative products, the pricing models used by the firm are widely accepted by the financial services industry.• more complex otc derivative products are typically less liquid and require more judgment in the implementation of the valuation technique since direct trading activity or quotes are unobservable. this includes certain types of interest rate derivatives with both volatility and correlation exposure, equity, commodity or foreign currency derivatives that are either longer-dated or include exposure to multiple underlyings, and credit derivatives, including cds on certain mortgage- or asset-backed securities and basket cds. where required inputs are unobservable, relationships to observable data points, based on historical and/or implied observations, may be employed as a technique to estimate the model input values. for further information on the valuation techniques for otc derivative products, see note 2.

• the firm carries certain borrowings at fair value which are primarily composed of: instruments whose payments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index, a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a commodity, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures; and instruments with various interest-rate-related features including step-ups, step-downs, and zero coupons.• fair value is determined using valuation models for the derivative and debt portions of the instruments. these models incorporate observable inputs referencing identical or comparable securities, including prices to which the instruments are linked, interest rate yield curves, option volatility and currency rates, and commodity or equity prices.• independent, external and traded prices are considered as well as the impact of the firm's own credit spreads which are based on observed secondary bond market spreads.

1.   during 2018, the firm transferred from level 3 to level 2 $2.4 billion of equity derivatives due to a reduction in the significance of the unobservable inputs relating to volatility.
level 3 instruments may be hedged with instruments classified in level 1 and level 2. the realized and unrealized gains (losses) for assets and liabilities within the level 3 category presented in the previous tables do not reflect the related realized and unrealized gains (losses) on hedging instruments that have been classified by the firm within the level 1 and/or level 2 categories.
the unrealized gains (losses) during the period for assets and liabilities within the level 3 category may include changes in fair value during the period that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. total realized and unrealized gains (losses) are primarily included in trading revenues in the income statements.
additionally, in the previous tables, consolidations of vies are included in purchases and deconsolidations of vies are included in settlements.

1.   a single amount is disclosed for range and average when there is no significant difference between the minimum, maximum and average. amounts represent weighted averages except where simple averages and the median of the inputs are more relevant.
2.   includes derivative contracts with multiple risks (i.e., hybrid products).
the previous tables provide information on the valuation techniques, significant unobservable inputs, and the ranges and averages for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis with a significant level 3 balance. the level of aggregation and breadth of products cause the range of inputs to be wide and not evenly distributed across the inventory of financial instruments. further, the range of unobservable inputs may differ across firms in the financial services industry because of diversity in the types of products included in each firm's inventory. there are no predictable relationships between multiple significant unobservable inputs attributable to a given valuation technique.
an increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable inputs would generally result in a higher (lower) fair value.

notes to consolidated financial statements instruments. valuation using comparable instruments can be done by calculating an implied yield (or spread over a liquid benchmark) from the price of a comparable bond or loan, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to derive a value for the bond or loan. the adjustment to yield (or spread) should account for relevant differences in the bonds or loans such as maturity or credit quality. alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable instrument and the bond or loan being valued in order to establish the value of the bond or loan.
•   comparable equity price: a price derived from equity raises, share buybacks and external bid levels, etc. a discount or premium may be included in the fair value estimate.
•   contingency probability: probability associated with the realization of an underlying event upon which the value of an asset is contingent.
•   ebitda multiple / exit multiple: the ratio of enterprise value to ebitda, where enterprise value is the aggregate value of equity and debt minus cash and cash equivalents. the ebitda multiple reflects the value of the company in terms of its full-year ebitda, whereas the exit multiple reflects the value of the company in terms of its full-year expected ebitda at exit. either multiple allows comparison between companies from an operational perspective as the effect of capital structure, taxation and depreciation/amortization is excluded.
•   recovery rate: amount expressed as a percentage of par that is expected to be received when a credit event occurs.
an increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable inputs would generally result in a lower (higher) fair value.
•   cash-synthetic basis: the measure of the price differential between cash financial instruments and their synthetic derivative-based equivalents. the range disclosed in the previous table signifies the number of points by which the synthetic bond equivalent price is higher than the quoted price of the underlying cash bonds.
•   credit spread: the credit spread reflects the additional net yield an investor can earn from a security with more credit risk relative to one with less credit risk. the credit spread of a particular security is often quoted in relation to the yield on a credit risk-free benchmark security or reference rate, typically either u.s. treasury or libor.
•   funding spread: the cost of borrowing defined as the incremental spread over the ois rate for a specific collateral rate (which refers to the rate applicable to a specific type of security pledged as collateral).
•   wacc: wacc represents the theoretical rate of return required to debt and equity investors. the wacc is used in a discounted cash flow model that calculates the value of the equity. the model assumes that the cash flow assumptions, including projections, are fully reflected in the current equity value, while the debt to equity ratio is held constant.
an increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable inputs would generally result in an impact to the fair value, but the magnitude and direction of the impact would depend on whether the firm is long or short the exposure.
•   correlation: a pricing input where the payoff is driven by more than one underlying risk. correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movement of two variables (i.e., how the change in one variable influences a change in the other variable).
•   interest rate curve: the term structure of interest rates (relationship between interest rates and the time to maturity) and a market's measure of future interest rates at the time of observation. an interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is a pricing input used in the discounting of any otc derivative cash flow.
•   volatility: the measure of variability in possible returns for an instrument given how much that instrument changes in value over time. volatility is a pricing input for options and, generally, the lower the volatility, the less risky the option. the level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying that option, the tenor and the strike price of the option.
•   volatility skew: the measure of the difference in implied volatility for options with identical underliers and expiry dates but with different strikes.

1.   investments in hedge funds may be subject to initial period lock-up or gate provisions, which restrict an investor from withdrawing from the fund during a certain initial period or restrict the redemption amount on any redemption date, respectively.
amounts in the previous table represent the firm's carrying value of general and limited partnership interests in fund investments, as well as any related performance-based fees in the form of carried interest. the carrying amounts are measured based on the nav of the fund taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held. this same measurement applies whether the fund investments are accounted for under the equity method or fair value.

1.   gains and losses for loans and other assets-other investments are classified in other revenues. for other items, gains and losses are recorded in other revenues if the item is held for sale; otherwise, they are recorded in other expenses.
2.   nonrecurring changes in the fair value of loans and lending commitments were calculated as follows: for the held-for-investment category, based on the value of the underlying collateral; and for the held-for-sale category, based on recently executed transactions, market price quotations, valuation models that incorporate market observable inputs where possible, such as comparable loan or debt prices and cds spread levels adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments, or default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are unobservable.
3.   losses related to other assets-other investments were determined using techniques that included discounted cash flow models, methodologies that incorporate multiples of certain comparable companies and recently executed transactions.
4.   losses related to other assets-premises, equipment and software generally include write-offs related to the disposal of certain assets.

the firm believes that the notional amounts of derivative contracts generally overstate its exposure. in most circumstances, notional amounts are used only as a reference point from which to calculate amounts owed between the parties to the contract. furthermore, notional amounts do not reflect the benefit of legally enforceable netting arrangements or risk mitigating transactions.

the firm enters into credit derivatives, principally cds, under which it receives or provides protection against the risk of default on a set of debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity or entities. a majority of the firm's counterparties for these derivatives are banks, broker-dealers, and insurance and other financial institutions.
the fair value amounts as shown in the previous tables are prior to cash collateral or counterparty netting.
the purchase of credit protection does not represent the sole manner in which the firm risk manages its exposure to credit derivatives. the firm manages its exposure to these derivative contracts through a variety of risk mitigation strategies, which include managing the credit and correlation risk across single-name, non-tranched indices and baskets, tranched indices and baskets, and cash positions. aggregate market risk limits have been established for credit derivatives, and market risk measures are routinely monitored against these limits. the firm may also recover amounts on the underlying reference obligation delivered to the firm under cds where credit protection was sold.
single-name cds.    a cds protects the buyer against the loss of principal on a bond or loan in case of a default by the issuer. the protection buyer pays a periodic premium (generally quarterly) over the life of the contract and is protected for the period. the firm, in turn, performs under a cds if a credit event as defined under the contract occurs. typical credit events include bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay and restructuring of the obligations of the referenced entity.
index and basket cds.    index and basket cds are products where credit protection is provided on a portfolio of single-name cds. generally, in the event of a default on one of the underlying names, the firm pays a pro rata portion of the total notional amount of the cds.
the firm also enters into tranched index and basket cds where credit protection is provided on a particular portion of the portfolio loss distribution. the most junior tranches cover initial defaults, and once losses exceed the notional of the tranche, they are passed on to the next most senior tranche in the capital structure.
other credit contracts.    the firm has invested in clns and cdos, which are hybrid instruments containing embedded derivatives, in which credit protection has been sold to the issuer of the note. if there is a credit event of a reference entity underlying the instrument, the principal balance of the note may not be repaid in full to the firm.

notes to consolidated financial statements the firm believes there are no securities in an unrealized loss position that are other-than-temporarily impaired after performing the analysis described in note 2. for afs securities, the firm does not intend to sell the securities and is not likely to be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. furthermore, for both afs and htm securities, the securities have not experienced credit losses as the unrealized losses reported in the previous table are primarily due to higher interest rates since those securities were purchased.

7. collateralized transactions the firm enters into securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions to, among other things, acquire securities to cover short positions and settle other securities obligations, to accommodate customers' needs and to finance its inventory positions.
the firm manages credit exposure arising from such transactions by, in appropriate circumstances, entering into master netting agreements and collateral agreements with its counterparties. these agreements provide the firm with the right, in the event of a default by the counterparty, to net a counterparty's rights and obligations under the agreement and to liquidate and set off collateral held by the firm against the net amount owed by the counterparty.
the firm's policy is generally to take possession of securities purchased or borrowed in connection with securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed transactions, respectively, and to receive cash and securities delivered under securities sold under agreements to repurchase or securities loaned transactions (with rights of rehypothecation).
the firm also monitors the fair value of the underlying securities as compared with the related receivable or payable, including accrued interest, and, as necessary, requests additional collateral, as provided under the applicable agreement to ensure such transactions are adequately collateralized, or the return of excess collateral.
the risk related to a decline in the market value of collateral pledged or received is managed by setting appropriate market-based margin requirements. increases in collateral margin calls on secured financing due to market value declines may be mitigated by increases in collateral margin calls on securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed transactions with similar quality collateral. additionally, the firm may request lower quality collateral pledged be replaced with higher quality collateral through collateral substitution rights in the underlying agreements.
the firm actively manages its secured financings in a manner that reduces the potential refinancing risk of secured financings of less liquid assets and also considers the quality of collateral when negotiating collateral eligibility with counterparties. the firm utilizes shorter term secured financing for highly liquid assets and has established longer tenor limits for less liquid assets, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption.

customer margin lending
$ in millions                                    at                   at december 31,         december 31,

customer receivables representing margin loans   $31,916              $26,225
the firm provides margin lending arrangements which allow customers to borrow against the value of qualifying securities. receivables under margin lending arrangements are included within customer and other receivables in the balance sheets. under these agreements and transactions, the firm receives collateral, which includes u.s. government and agency securities, other sovereign government obligations, corporate and other debt, and corporate equities. customer receivables generated from margin lending activities are collateralized by customer-owned securities held by the firm. the firm monitors required margin levels and established credit terms daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary.
margin loans are extended on a demand basis and generally are not committed facilities. factors considered in the review of margin loans are the amount of the loan, the intended purpose, the degree of leverage being employed in the account and the amount of collateral, as well as an overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification or, in the case of concentrated positions, appropriate liquidity of the underlying collateral or potential hedging strategies to reduce risk. underlying collateral for margin loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, valuation of securities, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations. for these transactions, adherence to the firm's collateral policies significantly limits its credit exposure in the event of a customer default. the firm may request additional margin collateral from customers, if appropriate, and, if necessary, may sell securities that have not been paid for or purchase securities sold but not delivered from customers.
other secured financings other secured financings include the liabilities related to transfers of financial assets that are accounted for as financings rather than sales, consolidated vies where the firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, and certain elns and other secured borrowings. these liabilities are generally payable from the cash flows of the related assets, which are accounted for as trading assets (see notes 12 and 14).
8. loans, lending commitments and allowance for credit losses the firm's loan portfolio consists of the following types of loans:
•   corporate. corporate loans primarily include commercial and industrial lending used for general corporate purposes, working capital and liquidity, event-driven loans, secured lending facilities, and securities-based lending. event-driven loans support client merger, acquisition, recapitalization or project finance activities. corporate loans are structured as revolving lines of credit, letter of credit facilities, term loans and bridge loans. risk factors considered in determining the allowance for corporate loans include the borrower's financial strength, industry, facility structure, collateral and covenants along with other qualitative factors.
•   consumer. consumer loans include unsecured loans and securities-based lending, which allows clients to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities for any suitable purpose other than purchasing, trading, or carrying securities or refinancing margin debt. the majority of consumer loans are structured as revolving lines of credit. the allowance methodology for unsecured loans considers the specific attributes of the loan, as well as the borrower's source of repayment. the allowance methodology for securities-based lending considers the collateral type underlying the loan (e.g., diversified securities, concentrated securities or restricted stock).

notes to consolidated financial statements and utilization rates in addition to the factors considered for non-conforming residential mortgages.
•   commercial real estate. commercial real estate loans include owner-occupied loans and income-producing loans. the principal risk factors for determining the allowance for commercial real estate loans are the underlying collateral type, loan-to-value ratio and debt service ratio.

credit quality crm evaluates new obligors before credit transactions are initially approved and at least annually thereafter for corporate and commercial real estate loans. for corporate loans, credit evaluations typically involve the evaluation of financial statements, assessment of leverage, liquidity, capital strength, asset composition and quality, market capitalization and access to capital markets, cash flow projections and debt service requirements, and the adequacy of collateral, if applicable. crm also evaluates strategy, market position, industry dynamics, obligor's management and other factors that could affect an obligor's risk profile.
for commercial real estate loans, the credit evaluation is focused on property and transaction metrics, including property type, loan-to-value ratio, occupancy levels, debt service ratio, prevailing capitalization rates and market dynamics.
for residential real estate and consumer loans, the initial credit evaluation typically includes, but is not limited to, review of the obligor's income, net worth, liquidity, collateral, loan-to-value ratio and credit bureau information. subsequent credit monitoring for residential real estate loans is performed at the portfolio level. consumer loan collateral values are monitored on an ongoing basis.
the firm utilizes the following credit quality indicators, which are consistent with u.s. banking agencies' definitions of criticized exposures, as applicable, in its credit monitoring process for loans held for investment:
•   pass. a credit exposure rated pass has a continued expectation of timely repayment, all obligations of the borrower are current, and the obligor complies with material terms and conditions of the lending agreement.
•   special mention. extensions of credit that have potential weakness that deserve management's close attention and, if left uncorrected, may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects or collateral position.
•   substandard. obligor has a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the repayment of the debt and has a high probability of payment default with the distinct possibility that the firm will sustain some loss if noted deficiencies are not corrected.
•   doubtful. inherent weakness in the exposure makes the collection or repayment in full, based on existing facts, conditions and circumstances, highly improbable, and the amount of loss is uncertain.
•   loss. extensions of credit classified as loss are considered uncollectible and are charged off.
loans considered as doubtful or loss are considered impaired. substandard loans are regularly reviewed for impairment. for further information, see note 2.

certain senior debt securities are denominated in various non-u.s. dollar currencies and may be structured to provide a return that is linked to equity, credit, commodity or other indices (e.g., the consumer price index). senior debt also may be structured to be callable by the firm or extendible at the option of holders of the senior debt securities.
the firm's borrowings also include notes carried and managed on a fair value basis. these include instruments whose payments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index, a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a commodity, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures, and instruments with various interest-rate-related features, including step-ups, step-downs and zero coupons. to minimize the exposure from such instruments, the firm has entered into various swap contracts and purchased options that effectively convert the borrowing costs into floating rates. the swaps and purchased options used to economically hedge the embedded features are derivatives and also are carried at fair value. changes in fair value related to the notes and economic hedges are reported in trading revenues. see notes 2 and 4 for further information on borrowings carried at fair value.

in general, other than securities inventories and customer balances financed by secured funding sources, the majority of the firm's assets are financed with a combination of deposits, short-term funding, floating rate long-term debt or fixed rate long-term debt swapped to a floating rate. the firm uses interest rate swaps to more closely match these borrowings to the duration, holding period and interest rate characteristics of the assets being funded and to manage interest rate risk. these swaps effectively convert certain of the firm's fixed rate borrowings into floating rate obligations. in addition, for non-u.s. dollar currency borrowings that are not used to fund assets in the same currency, the firm has entered into currency swaps that effectively convert the borrowings into u.s. dollar obligations.
the firm's use of swaps for asset and liability management affects its effective average borrowing rate.

forward-starting secured financing receivables.  this amount includes securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed that the firm has entered into prior to the balance sheet date that will settle after the balance sheet date. also included are commitments to enter into securities purchased under agreements to resell that are provided to certain clearinghouses or associated depositories of which the firm is a member and are contingent upon the default of a clearinghouse member or other stress event. these transactions are primarily secured by collateral from u.s. government agency securities and other sovereign government obligations when they are funded.
underwriting commitments.  the firm provides underwriting commitments in connection with its capital raising sources to a diverse group of corporate and other institutional clients.
investment activities.  the firm sponsors several non-consolidated investment management funds for third-party investors where it typically acts as general partner of, and investment advisor to, these funds and typically commits to invest a minority of the capital of such funds, with subscribing third-party investors contributing the majority. the firm has contractual capital commitments, guarantees and counterparty arrangements with respect to these investment management funds.
letters of credit and other financial guarantees.  the firm has outstanding letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued by third-party banks to certain of the firm's counterparties. the firm is contingently liable for these letters of credit and other financial guarantees, which are primarily used to provide collateral for securities and commodities traded and to satisfy various margin requirements in lieu of depositing cash or securities with these counterparties.

1.   these amounts include certain issued standby letters of credit participated to third parties, totaling $0.7 billion of notional and collateral/recourse, due to the nature of the firm's obligations under these arrangements.
2.   the carrying amounts of derivative contracts that meet the accounting definition of a guarantee are shown on a gross basis.
3.   primarily related to residential mortgage securitizations.
types of guarantees derivative contracts. certain derivative contracts meet the accounting definition of a guarantee, including certain written options, contingent forward contracts and cds (see note 5 regarding credit derivatives in which the firm has sold credit protection to the counterparty). all derivative contracts that could meet this accounting definition of a guarantee are included in the previous table, with the notional amount used as the maximum potential payout for certain derivative contracts, such as written interest rate caps and written foreign currency options. the firm evaluates collateral requirements for all derivatives, including derivatives that do not meet the accounting definition of a guarantee. for the effects of cash collateral and counterparty netting, see note 5.

notes to consolidated financial statements firm sets collateral requirements by counterparty so that the collateral covers various transactions and products and is not allocated specifically to individual contracts. also, the firm may recover amounts related to the underlying asset delivered to the firm under the derivative contract.
standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued. in connection with its corporate lending business and other corporate activities, the firm provides standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees to counterparties. such arrangements represent obligations to make payments to third parties if the counterparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a borrowing arrangement or other contractual obligation. a majority of the firm's standby letters of credit are provided on behalf of counterparties that are investment grade. if the counterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligation, the firm has access to collateral or recourse that would approximate its obligation.
market value guarantees. market value guarantees are issued to guarantee timely payment of a specified return to investors in certain affordable housing tax credit funds. these guarantees are designed to return an investor's contribution to a fund and the investor's share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by a fund.
liquidity facilities. the firm has entered into liquidity facilities with spes and other counterparties, whereby the firm is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. primarily, the firm acts as liquidity provider to municipal bond securitization spes and for standalone municipal bonds in which the holders of beneficial interests issued by these spes or the holders of the individual bonds, respectively, have the right to tender their interests for purchase by the firm on specified dates at a specified price. the firm often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the spes in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities, as well as make-whole or recourse provisions with the trust sponsors. the recourse amount often exceeds the maximum potential payout amount of the guarantee. substantially all of the underlying assets in the spes are investment grade. liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives.
whole loan sales guarantees. the firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain whole loan sales. under certain circumstances, the firm may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. the firm's maximum potential payout related to such representations and warranties is equal to the current upb of such loans. since the firm no longer services these loans, it has no information on the current upb of those loans, and accordingly, the amount included in the previous table represents the upb at the time of the whole loan sale or at the time when the firm last serviced any of those loans. the current upb balances could be substantially lower than the maximum potential payout amount included in the previous table. the related liability primarily relates to sales of loans to the federal mortgage agencies.
securitization representations and warranties. as part of the firm's institutional securities business segment's securitizations and related activities, the firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain assets transferred in securitization transactions sponsored by the firm. the extent and nature of the representations and warranties, if any, vary among different securitizations. under certain circumstances, the firm may be required to repurchase certain assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. the maximum potential amount of future payments the firm could be required to make would be equal to the current outstanding balances of, or losses associated with, the assets subject to breaches of such representations and warranties. the amount included in the previous table for the maximum potential payout includes the current upb or historical losses where known, and the upb at the time of sale when the current upb is not known.
general partner guarantees. as a general partner in certain investment management funds, the firm receives certain distributions from the partnerships when the return exceeds specified performance targets according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. the firm may be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements, subject to certain limitations.
client clearing guarantees. in 2019, the firm became a sponsoring member of the government securities division of the ficc's sponsored clearing model. clients of the firm, as sponsored members, can transact in overnight securities repurchase and resale agreements, which are cleared through ficc. as sponsoring member, the firm guarantees to ficc the prompt and full payment and performance of its clients' obligations. the amount included in the previous table represents the maximum potential payout the firm could be responsible for through the guarantee it provides. the firm minimizes credit exposure under this guarantee by obtaining a security interest in its sponsored member clients' collateral and their contractual rights under sponsored member transactions. therefore, the firm's exposure is estimated to be an amount substantially lower than the maximum potential payout amount. the collateral amount in which the firm has a security interest is approximately equal to the maximum potential payout amount of the guarantee.
other guarantees and indemnities in the normal course of business, the firm provides guarantees and indemnifications in a variety of transactions. these
123     december 2019 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements provisions generally are standard contractual terms. certain of these guarantees and indemnifications are described below:
•   indemnities. the firm provides standard indemnities to counterparties for certain contingent exposures and taxes, including u.s. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest and other payments made on derivatives, securities and stock lending transactions, certain annuity products and other financial arrangements. these indemnity payments could be required based on a change in the tax laws, a change in interpretation of applicable tax rulings or a change in factual circumstances. certain contracts contain provisions that enable the firm to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of such events. the maximum potential amount of future payments that the firm could be required to make under these indemnifications cannot be estimated.
•   exchange/clearinghouse member guarantees. the firm is a member of various exchanges and clearinghouses that trade and clear securities and/or derivative contracts. associated with its membership, the firm may be required to pay a certain amount as determined by the exchange or the clearinghouse in case of a default of any of its members or pay a proportionate share of the financial obligations of another member that may default on its obligations to the exchange or the clearinghouse. while the rules governing different exchange or clearinghouse memberships and the forms of these guarantees may vary, in general the firm's obligations under these rules would arise only if the exchange or clearinghouse had previously exhausted its resources.
in addition, some clearinghouse rules require members to assume a proportionate share of losses resulting from the clearinghouse's investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, and of other losses unrelated to the default of a clearing member, if such losses exceed the specified resources allocated for such purpose by the clearinghouse.
the maximum potential payout under these rules cannot be estimated. the firm has not recorded any contingent liability in its financial statements for these agreements and believes that any potential requirement to make payments under these agreements is remote.
•   merger and acquisition guarantees. the firm may, from time to time, in its role as investment banking advisor be required to provide guarantees in connection with certain european merger and acquisition transactions. if required by the regulating authorities, the firm provides a guarantee that the acquirer in the merger and acquisition transaction has or will have sufficient funds to complete the transaction and would then be required to make the acquisition payments in the event the acquirer's funds are insufficient at the completion date of the transaction. these arrangements generally cover the time frame from the transaction offer date to its closing date and, therefore, are generally short term in nature. the firm believes the likelihood of any payment by the firm under these arrangements is remote given the level of its due diligence in its role as investment banking advisor.
in addition, in the ordinary course of business, the firm guarantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations (including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. these guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties. the activities of the firm's subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the financial statements.
contingencies legal in addition to the matters described below, in the normal course of business, the firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. in some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress. these actions have included, but are not limited to, residential mortgage and credit crisis-related matters.
while the firm has identified below any individual proceedings where the firm believes a material loss to be reasonably possible and reasonably estimable, there can be no assurance that material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be probable or possible and reasonably estimable losses.
the firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the firm accrues the estimated loss by a charge to income.

legal expenses      $221          $206          $342
the firm's future legal expenses may fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment regarding government investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the firm.

notes to consolidated financial statements previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss.
for certain legal proceedings and investigations, the firm cannot reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question, before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation.
for certain other legal proceedings and investigations, the firm can estimate reasonably possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued but does not believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that such losses will have a material adverse effect on the firm's financial statements as a whole, other than the matters referred to in the following paragraphs.

14. variable interest entities and securitization activities overview the firm is involved with various spes in the normal course of business. in most cases, these entities are deemed to be vies.
the firm's variable interests in vies include debt and equity interests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments and certain fees. the firm's involvement with vies arises primarily from:
•   interests purchased in connection with market-making activities, securities held in its investment securities portfolio and retained interests held as a result of securitization activities, including re-securitization transactions.
•   guarantees issued and residual interests retained in connection with municipal bond securitizations.
•   loans made to and investments in vies that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.
•   derivatives entered into with vies.
•   structuring of clns or other asset-repackaged notes designed to meet the investment objectives of clients.
•   other structured transactions designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the firm or its clients.
the firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a vie upon its initial involvement with the vie and reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the vie. this determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the vie, including the vie's structure and activities, the power to make significant economic decisions held by the firm and by other parties, and the variable interests owned by the firm and other parties.

notes to consolidated financial statements unless it holds certain other rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager or to require the liquidation of the entity. if the firm serves as servicer or collateral manager, or has certain other rights described in the previous sentence, the firm analyzes the interests in the vie that it holds and consolidates only those vies for which it holds a potentially significant interest in the vie.
for many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, clns and other asset-repackaged notes, there are no significant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. in these cases, the firm focuses its analysis on decisions made prior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the termination of the transaction. the firm concluded in most of these transactions that decisions made prior to the initial closing were shared between the firm and the initial investors based upon the nature of the assets, including whether the assets were issued in a transaction sponsored by the firm and the extent of the information available to the firm and to investors, the number, nature and involvement of investors, other rights held by the firm and investors, the standardization of the legal documentation and the level of continuing involvement by the firm, including the amount and type of interests owned by the firm and by other investors. the firm focused its control decision on any right held by the firm or investors related to the termination of the vie. most re-securitization transactions, clns and other asset-repackaged notes have no such termination rights.

consolidated vie assets and liabilities are presented in the previous tables after intercompany eliminations. generally, most assets owned by consolidated vies cannot be removed unilaterally by the firm and are not available to the firm while the related liabilities issued by consolidated vies are non-recourse to the firm. however, in certain consolidated vies, the firm either has the unilateral right to remove assets or provides additional recourse through derivatives such as total return swaps, guarantees or other forms of involvement.
in general, the firm's exposure to loss in consolidated vies is limited to losses that would be absorbed on the vie net assets recognized in its financial statements, net of amounts absorbed by third-party variable interest holders.

1.   amounts include transactions backed by residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans and other types of assets, including consumer or commercial assets. and may be in loan or security form.
2.   other primarily includes exposures to commercial real estate property and investment funds.
3.   where notional amounts are utilized in quantifying the maximum exposure related to derivatives, such amounts do not reflect changes in fair value recorded by the firm.
4.   additional vie assets owned represents the carrying value of total exposure to non-consolidated vies for which the maximum exposure to loss is less than specific thresholds, primarily interests issued by securitization spes. the firm's primary risk exposure is to the most subordinate class of beneficial interest and maximum exposure to loss generally equals the fair value of the assets owned. these assets are primarily included in trading assets and investment securities and are measured at fair value (see note 3). the firm does not provide additional support in these transactions through contractual facilities, guarantees or similar derivatives.
5.   the carrying value and maximum exposure to loss of variable interests related to mabs and other have been revised to reflect the addition of approximately $11 billion in loans to vies that were previously excluded. the vie asset (upb) amounts have also been revised by approximately $54 billion. this disclosure-only revision did not impact the firm's balance sheets.
the majority of the vies included in the previous tables are sponsored by unrelated parties; examples of the firm's involvement with these vies include its secondary market-making activities and the securities held in its investment securities portfolio (see note 6).
the firm's maximum exposure to loss is dependent on the nature of the firm's variable interest in the vie and is limited to the notional amounts of certain liquidity facilities and other credit support, total return swaps and written put options, as well as the fair value of certain other derivatives and investments the firm has made in the vie.
the firm's maximum exposure to loss in the previous tables does not include the offsetting benefit of hedges or any reductions associated with the amount of collateral held as part of a transaction with the vie or any party to the vie directly against a specific exposure to loss.
liabilities issued by vies generally are non-recourse to the firm.

1.   the balances as of december 31, 2018 were revised as noted in the non-consolidated vies table herein.
securitization activities in a securitization transaction, the firm transfers assets (generally commercial or residential mortgage loans or securities) to an spe, sells to investors most of the beneficial interests, such as notes or certificates, issued by the spe, and, in many cases, retains other beneficial interests. the purchase of the transferred assets by the spe is financed through the sale of these interests.
in many securitization transactions involving commercial mortgage loans, the firm transfers a portion of the assets to the spe with unrelated parties transferring the remaining assets. in addition, mainly in securitization transactions involving residential mortgage loans, the firm may also enter into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps or interest rate caps, with the spe.
although not obligated, the firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by spes in securitization transactions. as a market maker, the firm offers to buy these securities from, and sell these securities to, investors. securities purchased through these market-making activities are not considered to be retained interests; these beneficial interests generally are included in trading assets-corporate and other debt and are measured at fair value.
the firm enters into derivatives, generally interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, with a senior payment priority in many securitization transactions. the risks associated with these and similar derivatives with spes are essentially the same as similar derivatives with non-spe counterparties and are managed as part of the firm's overall exposure. see note 5 for further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities.
investment securities the firm holds securities issued by vies within the investment securities portfolio. these securities are composed of those related to transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage agencies and predominantly the most senior securities issued by vies backed by student loans and commercial mortgage loans.

notes to consolidated financial statements transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage agencies include an explicit or implicit guarantee provided by the u.s. government. additionally, the firm holds certain commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by vies retained as a result of the firm's securitization activities. see note 6 for further information on the investment securities portfolio.
municipal tender option bond trusts in a municipal tender option bond trust transaction, the client transfers a municipal bond to a trust. the trust issues short-term securities that the firm, as the remarketing agent, sells to investors. the client generally retains a residual interest. the short-term securities are supported by a liquidity facility pursuant to which the investors may put their short-term interests. in most programs, a third-party provider will provide such liquidity facility; in some programs, the firm provides this liquidity facility.
the firm may, in lieu of purchasing short-term securities for remarketing, decide to extend a temporary loan to the trust. the client can generally terminate the transaction at any time. the liquidity provider can generally terminate the transaction upon the occurrence of certain events. when the transaction is terminated, the municipal bond is generally sold or returned to the client. any losses suffered by the liquidity provider upon the sale of the bond are the responsibility of the client. this obligation is generally collateralized. liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives. the firm consolidates any municipal tender option bond trusts in which it holds the residual interest.
credit protection purchased through credit-linked notes cln transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain credit risk on referenced assets. in these transactions, the firm transfers assets (generally high-quality securities or money market investments) to an spe, enters into a derivative transaction in which the spe sells protection on an unrelated referenced asset or group of assets, through a credit derivative, and sells the securities issued by the spe to investors. in some transactions, the firm may also enter into interest rate or currency swaps with the spe. depending on the structure, the assets and liabilities of the spe may be consolidated and recognized in the firm's balance sheets or accounted for as a sale of assets.
upon the occurrence of a credit event related to the referenced asset, the spe will deliver securities collateral as payment to the firm, which exposes the firm to changes in the collateral's value.
derivative payments by the spe are collateralized. the risks associated with these and similar derivatives with spes are essentially the same as those with non-spe counterparties and are managed as part of the firm's overall exposure.
other structured financings the firm invests in interests issued by entities that develop and own low-income communities (including low-income housing projects) and entities that construct and own facilities that will generate energy from renewable resources. the interests entitle the firm to a share of tax credits and tax losses generated by these projects. in addition, the firm has issued guarantees to investors in certain low-income housing funds. the guarantees are designed to return an investor's contribution to a fund and the investor's share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by the fund. the firm is also involved with entities designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the firm or its clients.
collateralized loan and debt obligations clos and cdos are spes that purchase a pool of assets consisting of corporate loans, corporate bonds, abs or synthetic exposures on similar assets through derivatives, and issue multiple tranches of debt and equity securities to investors. the firm underwrites the securities issued in certain clo transactions on behalf of unaffiliated sponsors and provides advisory services to these unaffiliated sponsors. the firm sells corporate loans to many of these spes, in some cases representing a significant portion of the total assets purchased. although not obligated, the firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by spes in these transactions and may retain unsold securities. these beneficial interests are included in trading assets and are measured at fair value.
equity-linked notes eln transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain risks related to the specific equity security, equity index or other index. in an eln transaction, the firm typically transfers to an spe either a note issued by the firm, the payments on which are linked to the performance of a specific equity security, equity index or other index, or debt securities issued by other companies and a derivative contract, the terms of which will relate to the performance of a specific equity security, equity index or other index. these eln transactions with spes were not consolidated at december 31, 2019 or december 31, 2018.

1.   the transferred assets with continuing involvement tables include transactions with spes in which the firm, acting as principal, transferred financial assets with continuing involvement and received sales treatment. see note 12 for information on certain other transfers of assets to spes which are accounted for as financings.
2.   as permitted by applicable guidance, certain transfers of assets where the firm's only continuing involvement is a derivative are only reported in the following assets sold with retained exposure table, and are no longer also included in this table. at december 31, 2018 these transactions were included in cln and other and comprised approximately $8 billion in upb, $20 million in derivative assets and $119 million in derivative liabilities.
3.   amounts include clo transactions managed by unrelated third parties.
4.   amounts include assets transferred by unrelated transferors.
transferred assets are carried at fair value prior to securitization, and any changes in fair value are recognized in the income statements. the firm may act as underwriter of the beneficial interests issued by these securitization vehicles, for which investment banking revenues are recognized. the firm may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. these retained interests are generally carried at fair value in the balance sheets with changes in fair value recognized in the income statements. fair value for these interests is measured using techniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques applied to the firm's major categories of assets and liabilities as described in notes 2 and 3.

15. regulatory requirements regulatory capital framework the firm is an fhc under the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended, and is subject to the regulation and oversight of the board of governors of the federal reserve system ("federal reserve"). the federal reserve establishes capital requirements for the firm, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates the firm's compliance with such capital requirements. the occ establishes similar capital requirements and standards for msbna and mspbna (collectively, the "u.s. bank subsidiaries"). the regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the basel iii capital standards established by the basel committee on banking supervision and also implement certain provisions of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act.
regulatory capital requirements the firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital requirements. a summary of the calculations of regulatory capital, rwa and transition provisions follows.
minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital (which includes tier 2 capital). capital standards require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios.
in addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements, the firm is subject to the following buffers:
•   a greater than 2.5% common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer;
•   the common equity tier 1 g-sib capital surcharge, currently at 3%; and
•   up to a 2.5% common equity tier 1 ccyb, currently set by u.s. banking agencies at zero.
in 2018, the requirement for each of these buffers was 75% of the fully phased-in 2019 requirement noted above.
risk-weighted assets rwa reflects both the firm's on- and off-balance sheet risk, as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following:
•   credit risk: the failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to the firm;
•   market risk: adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and
•   operational risk: inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events (e.g., fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets).
the firm's risk-based capital ratios for purposes of determining regulatory compliance are the lower of the capital ratios computed under (i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk rwa ("standardized approach") and (ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk rwa ("advanced approach"). at december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, the firm's risk-based capital ratios are based on the standardized approach rules.
minimum leverage-based capital requirements include a tier 1 leverage ratio and an slr. the firm is required to maintain a tier 1 slr of 5%, inclusive of an enhanced slr capital buffer of at least 2%.

1.   required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented. for 2018, the required regulatory capital ratios for risk-based capital are under the transitional rules. failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on the firm's ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.
2.   adjusted average assets represents the denominator of the tier 1 leverage ratio and is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by disallowed goodwill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in the firm's own capital instruments, certain defined tax assets and other capital deductions.
3.   supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of adjusted average assets used in the tier 1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, potential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures.
u.s. bank subsidiaries' regulatory capital and capital ratios the occ establishes capital requirements for the firm's u.s. bank subsidiaries and evaluates their compliance with such capital requirements. regulatory capital requirements for the u.s. bank subsidiaries are calculated in a similar manner to the firm's regulatory capital requirements, although g-sib capital surcharge requirements do not apply to the u.s. bank subsidiaries.
the occ's regulatory capital framework includes prompt corrective action ("pca") standards, including "well-capitalized" pca standards that are based on specified regulatory capital ratio minimums. for the firm to remain an fhc, the u.s. bank subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with the occ's pca standards. in addition, failure by the u.s. bank subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the u.s. bank subsidiaries' and the firm's financial statements.
at december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, the u.s. bank subsidiaries' risk-based capital ratios are based on the standardized approach rules. in each period, the ratios exceeded well-capitalized requirements.

a portion of common stock repurchases was conducted under a sales plan with mufg, whereby mufg sold shares of the firm's common stock to the firm, as part of the firm's share repurchase program. the sales plan is only intended to maintain mufg's ownership percentage below 24.9% in order to comply with mufg's passivity commitments to the board of governors of the federal reserve system and has no impact on the strategic alliance between mufg and the firm, including the joint ventures in japan.
pursuant to the share repurchase program, the firm considers, among other things, business segment capital needs, as well as stock-based compensation and benefit plan requirements. share repurchases under the program will be exercised from time to time at prices the firm deems appropriate subject to various factors, including the firm's capital position and market conditions. the share repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through rule 10b5-1 plans, and may be suspended at any time. share repurchases by the firm are subject to regulatory non-objection.

the u.s. qualified plan's assets represent 87% of the firm's total pension plan assets. the u.s. qualified plan uses a combination of active and risk-controlled fixed income investment strategies. the fixed income asset allocation consists primarily of fixed income securities and related derivative instruments designed to approximate the expected cash flows of the plan's liabilities in order to help reduce plan exposure to interest rate variation and to better align assets with the obligation. the longer-duration fixed income allocation is expected to help protect the plan's funded status and maintain the stability of plan contributions over the long run. the investment portfolio performance is assessed by comparing actual investment performance with changes in the estimated present value of the u.s. qualified plan's benefit obligation.
derivative instruments are permitted in the u.s. qualified plan's investment portfolio only to the extent that they comply with all of the plan's investment policy guidelines and are consistent with the plan's risk and return objectives.
as a fundamental operating principle, any restrictions on the underlying assets apply to a respective derivative product. this includes percentage allocations and credit quality. derivatives are used solely for the purpose of enhancing investment in the underlying assets and not to circumvent portfolio restrictions.
plan assets are measured at fair value using valuation techniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques applied to the firm's major categories of assets and liabilities as described in notes  and . otc derivative contracts consist of investments in interest rate swaps and total return swaps. other investments consist of pledged insurance annuity contracts held by non-u.s.-based plans. the pledged insurance annuity contracts are valued based on the premium reserve of the insurer for a guarantee that the insurer has given to the employee benefit plan that approximates fair value. the pledged insurance annuity contracts are categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
commingled trust funds are privately offered funds regulated, supervised and subject to periodic examination by a u.s. federal or state agency and available to institutional clients. the trust must be maintained for the collective investment or reinvestment of assets contributed to it from u.s. tax-qualified employee benefit plans maintained by more than one employer or controlled group of corporations. the sponsor of the commingled trust funds values the funds based on the fair value of the underlying securities. commingled trust funds are redeemable at nav at the measurement date or in the near future.
some non-u.s.-based plans hold foreign funds that consist of investments in fixed income funds, target cash flow funds and liquidity funds. fixed income funds invest in individual securities quoted on a recognized stock exchange or traded in a regulated market. certain fixed income funds aim to produce returns consistent with certain financial times stock exchange indexes. target cash flow funds are designed to provide a series of fixed annual cash flows achieved by investing in government bonds and derivatives. liquidity funds place a high priority on capital preservation, stable value and a high liquidity of assets. foreign funds are readily redeemable at nav.
the firm generally considers the nav of commingled trust funds and foreign funds provided by the fund manager to be the best estimate of fair value.
expected contributions the firm's policy is to fund at least the amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax laws. at december 31, 2019, the firm expected to contribute approximately $50 million to its pension and postretirement benefit plans in 2020 based upon the plans' current funded status and expected asset return assumptions for 2020.

the firm's effective tax rates for 2019 and 2018 include intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $348 million and $203 million, respectively, primarily associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest as a result of new information pertaining to multi-jurisdiction tax examinations.
the firm's effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2017 included an intermittent net discrete tax provision of $968 million, which included an approximate $1.2 billion provision primarily related to the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets as a result of the tax act, partially offset by $233 million of net discrete tax benefits primarily associated with the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year irs tax examinations.
the tax act, enacted on december 22, 2017, significantly revised u.s. corporate income tax law by reducing the corporate income tax rate to 21%, partially or wholly eliminating tax deductions for certain expenses and implementing a modified territorial tax system. the modified territorial tax system included a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries and also imposes a minimum tax on gilti and an alternative beat on u.s. corporations with operations outside the u.s.

deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse.
the firm believes the recognized net deferred tax assets (after valuation allowance) at december 31, 2019 are more likely than not to be realized based on expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested due to regulatory and other capital requirements in foreign jurisdictions. as a result of the tax act's one-time transition tax on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and an annual minimum tax on gilti, as of december 31, 2019 the unrecognized deferred tax liability attributable to indefinitely reinvested earnings is immaterial.

tax authority examinations the firm is under continuous examination by the irs and other tax authorities in certain countries, such as japan and the u.k., and in states and localities in which it has significant business operations, such as new york. the firm has established a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and associated interest, if applicable ("tax liabilities"), that it believes is adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. once established, the firm adjusts such tax liabilities only when new information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change.
the firm believes that the resolution of the above tax examinations will not have a material effect on the annual financial statements, although a resolution could have a material impact in the income statements and on the effective tax rate for any period in which such resolutions occur.
see note 13 regarding the dutch tax authority's challenge, in the district court in amsterdam (matters styled case number 15/3637 and case number 15/4353), of the firm's entitlement to certain withholding tax credits, which may impact the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.
it is reasonably possible that significant changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months. at this time, however, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the impact on the firm's effective tax rate over the next 12 months.

item 1a - risk factors xcel energy is subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond our control. risks that may adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows are described below. these risks should be carefully considered together with the other information set forth in this report and future reports that we file with the sec.
oversight of risk and related processes the board of directors is responsible for the oversight of material risk and maintaining an effective risk monitoring process. management and the board of directors' committees have responsibility for overseeing the identification and mitigation of key risks and reporting its assessments and activities to the full board of directors.
xcel energy maintains a robust compliance program and promotes a culture of compliance beginning with the tone at the top. the risk mitigation process includes adherence to our code of conduct and compliance policies, operation of formal risk management structures and overall business management. xcel energy further mitigates inherent risks through formal risk committees and corporate functions such as internal audit, and internal controls over financial reporting and legal.
management identifies and analyzes risks to determine materiality and other attributes such as timing, probability and controllability. identification and risk analysis occurs formally through risk assessment conducted by senior management, the financial disclosure process, hazard risk procedures, internal audit and compliance with financial and operational controls.
management also identifies and analyzes risk through the business planning process, development of goals and establishment of key performance indicators, including identification of barriers to implementing the company's strategy. the business planning process also identifies likelihood and mitigating factors to prevent the assumption of inappropriate risk to meet goals.
management communicates regularly with the board of directors and key stakeholders regarding risk. senior management presents and communicates a periodic risk assessment to the board of directors, providing information on the risks that management believes are material, including financial impact, timing, likelihood and mitigating factors. the board of directors regularly reviews management's key risk assessments, which includes areas of existing and future macroeconomic, financial, operational, policy, environmental and security risks.
the oversight, management and mitigation of risk is an integral and continuous part of the board of directors' governance of xcel energy. the board of directors assigns oversight of critical risks to each of its four committees to ensure these risks are well understood and given appropriate focus.
the audit committee is responsible for reviewing the adequacy of the committee's risk oversight and affirming appropriate aggregate oversight occurs. committees regularly report on their oversight activities and certain risk issues may be brought to the full board of directors for consideration when deemed appropriate.
new risks are considered and assigned as appropriate during the annual board of directors and committee evaluation process, resulting in updates to the committee charters and annual work plans. additionally, the board of directors conducts an annual strategy session where xcel energy's future plans and initiatives are reviewed.
risks associated with our business operational risks our natural gas and electric transmission and distribution operations involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.
our natural gas transmission and distribution activities include inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, explosions, outages and mechanical problems. our electric generation, transmission and distribution activities include inherent hazards and operating risks such as contact, fire and outages. these risks could result in loss of life, significant property damage, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial financial losses. we maintain insurance against most, but not all, of these risks and losses. the occurrence of these events, if not fully covered by insurance, could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
additionally, compliance with existing and potential new regulations related to the operation and maintenance of our natural gas infrastructure could result in significant costs. the phmsa is responsible for administering the dot's national regulatory program to assure the safe transportation of natural gas, petroleum and other hazardous materials by pipelines. the phmsa continues to develop regulations and other approaches to risk management to assure safety in design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance and emergency response of natural gas pipeline infrastructure. we have programs in place to comply with these regulations and systematically monitor and renew infrastructure over time, however, a significant incident or material finding of non-compliance could result in penalties and higher costs of operations.
our natural gas and electric transmission and distribution operations are dependent upon complex information technology systems and network infrastructure, the failure of which could disrupt our normal business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to process transactions and provide services.
our utility operations are subject to long-term planning and project risks.
most electric utility investments are planned to be used for decades. transmission and generation investments typically have long lead times and are planned well in advance of in-service dates and typically subject to long-term resource plans. these plans are based on numerous assumptions such as: sales growth, customer usage, commodity prices, economic activity, costs, regulatory mechanisms, customer behavior, available technology and public policy. xcel energy's long-term resource plan is dependent on our ability to obtain required approvals, develop necessary technical expertise, allocate and coordinate sufficient resources and adhere to budgets and timelines.
in addition, the long-term nature of both our planning and our asset lives are subject to risk. the electric utility sector is undergoing a period of significant change. for example, increases in energy efficiency, wider adoption of lower cost renewable generation, distributed generation and shifts away from coal generation to decrease carbon emissions and increasing use of natural gas in electric generation driven by lower natural gas prices. customer adoption of these technologies and increased energy efficiency could result in excess transmission and generation resources, downward pressure on sales growth, as well as stranded costs if we are not able to fully recover costs and investments.
changing customer expectations and technologies are requiring significant investments in advanced grid infrastructure, which increases exposure to technology obsolescence. evolving stakeholder preference for lower emission generation sources may pressure our investments in natural gas generation and delivery.
the magnitude and timing of resource additions and changes in customer demand may not coincide while customer preference for resource generation may change, which introduces further uncertainty into long-term planning. additionally, multiple states may not agree as to the appropriate resource mix, which may lead to costs to comply with one jurisdiction that are not recoverable across all jurisdictions served by the same assets.
we are subject to longer-term availability of inputs such as coal, natural gas, uranium and water to cool our facilities. lack of availability of these resources could jeopardize long-term operations of our facilities or make them uneconomic to operate.
we are subject to commodity risks and other risks associated with energy markets and energy production.
in the event fuel costs increase, customer demand could decline and bad debt expense may rise, which may have a material impact on our results of operations. despite existing fuel recovery mechanisms in most of our states, higher fuel costs could significantly impact our results of operations if costs are not recovered. delays in the timing of the collection of fuel cost recoveries could impact our cash flows.
a significant disruption in supply could cause us to seek alternative supply services at potentially higher costs and supply shortages may not be fully resolved, which could cause disruptions in our ability to provide services to our customers. failure to provide service due to disruptions may also result in fines, penalties or cost disallowances through the regulatory process. also, significantly higher energy or fuel costs relative to sales commitments could negatively impact our cash flows and results of operations.
we also engage in wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity, energy and energy-related products as well as natural gas. in many markets, emission allowances and/or recs are also needed to comply with various statutes and commission rulings. as a result, we are subject to market supply and commodity price risk. commodity price changes can affect the value of our commodity trading derivatives. we mark certain derivatives to estimated fair market value on a daily basis. settlements can vary significantly from estimated fair values recorded and significant changes from the assumptions underlying our fair value estimates could cause earnings variability.
failure to attract and retain a qualified workforce could have an adverse effect on operations.
certain specialized knowledge is required of our technical employees for construction and operation of transmission, generation and distribution assets. the company's business strategy is dependent on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. competition for skilled employees is high in the areas of business operations. failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. we have seen a tightening of supply for engineers and skilled laborers in certain markets and are implementing plans to retain these employees. inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
our operations use third-party contractors in addition to employees to perform periodic and ongoing work.
we rely on third-party contractors to perform operations, maintenance and construction work. our contractual arrangements with these contractors typically include performance standards, progress payments, insurance requirements and security for performance. poor vendor performance could impact ongoing operations, restoration operations, our reputation and could introduce financial risk or risks of fines.
our subsidiary, nsp-minnesota, is subject to the risks of nuclear generation.
nsp-minnesota has two nuclear generation plants, pi and monticello. risks of nuclear generation include:
•   hazards associated with the use of radioactive material in energy production, including management, handling, storage and disposal;
•   limitations on insurance available to cover losses that may arise in connection with nuclear operations, as well as obligations to contribute to an insurance pool in the event of damages at a covered u.s. reactor; and
•   technological and financial uncertainties related to the costs of decommissioning nuclear plants may cause our funding obligations to change.
the nrc has authority to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities, including the ability to impose fines and/or shut down a unit until compliance is achieved. revised nrc safety requirements could necessitate substantial capital expenditures or an increase in operating expenses. in addition, the institute for nuclear power operations reviews nsp-minnesota's nuclear operations and nuclear generation facilities. compliance with the institute for nuclear power operations' recommendations could result in substantial capital expenditures or a substantial increase in operating expenses.
if an incident did occur, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. furthermore, non-compliance or the occurrence of a serious incident at other nuclear facilities could result in increased industry regulation, which may increase nsp-minnesota's compliance costs.
nsp-wisconsin's production and transmission system is operated on an integrated basis with nsp-minnesota and may be subject to risks associated with nsp-minnesota's nuclear generation.
financial risks our profitability depends on the ability of our utility subsidiaries to recover their costs and changes in regulation may impair the ability of our utility subsidiaries to recover costs from their customers.
we are subject to comprehensive regulation by federal and state utility regulatory agencies, including siting and construction of facilities, customer service and the rates that we can charge customers.
the profitability of our utility operations is dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services and earning a return on capital investment. our rates are generally regulated and are based on an analysis of the utility's costs incurred in a test year. the utility subsidiaries are subject to both future and historical test years depending upon the regulatory jurisdiction. thus, the rates a utility is allowed to charge may or may not match its costs at any given time. rate regulation is premised on providing an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital.
there can also be no assurance that our regulatory commissions will judge all the costs of our utility subsidiaries to be prudent, which could result in disallowances, or that the regulatory process will always result in rates that will produce full recovery.
overall, management believes prudently incurred costs are recoverable given the existing regulatory framework. however, there may be changes in the regulatory environment that could impair the ability of our utility subsidiaries to recover costs historically collected from customers, or these subsidiaries could exceed caps on capital costs (e.g., wind projects) required by commissions and result in less than full recovery.
changes in the long-term cost-effectiveness or to the operating conditions of our assets may result in early retirements of utility facilities. while regulation typically provides relief for these types of changes, there is no assurance that regulators would allow full recovery of all remaining costs.
in a continued low interest rate environment, there has been increased downward pressure on allowed roe. conversely, higher than expected inflation or tariffs may increase costs of construction and operations. also, rising fuel costs could increase the risk that our utility subsidiaries will not be able to fully recover their fuel costs from their customers.
adverse regulatory rulings or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and materially affect our ability to meet our financial obligations, including debt payments and the payment of dividends on common stock.
any reductions in our credit ratings could increase our financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships.
we cannot be assured that our current ratings or our subsidiaries' ratings will remain in effect, or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn by a rating agency. significant events including disallowance of costs, significantly lower returns on equity, changes to equity ratios and impacts of tax policy may impact our cash flows and credit metrics, potentially resulting in a change in our credit ratings. in addition, our credit ratings may change as a result of the differing methodologies or change in the methodologies used by the various rating agencies.
any downgrade could lead to higher borrowing costs and could impact our ability to access capital markets. also, our utility subsidiaries may enter into contracts that require posting of collateral or settlement of applicable contracts if credit ratings fall below investment grade.
we are subject to capital market and interest rate risks.
utility operations require significant capital investment. as a result, we frequently need to access capital markets. capital markets are global and impacted by issues and events throughout the world. any disruption in capital markets could have a material impact on our ability to fund our operations. capital market disruption and financial market distress could prevent us from issuing short-term commercial paper, issuing new securities or cause us to issue securities with unfavorable terms and conditions, such as higher interest rates. higher interest rates on short-term borrowings with variable interest rates could also have an adverse effect on our operating results.
the performance of capital markets impacts the value of assets held in trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommission nsp-minnesota's nuclear plants and satisfy our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations. these assets are subject to market fluctuations and yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected returns. a decline in the market value of these assets may increase funding requirements. additionally, the fair value of the debt securities held in the nuclear decommissioning and/or pension trusts may be impacted by changes in interest rates.
we are subject to credit risks.
credit risk includes the risk that our customers will not pay their bills, which may lead to a reduction in liquidity and an increase in bad debt expense. credit risk is comprised of numerous factors including the price of products and services provided, the overall economy and local economies in the geographic areas we serve, including local unemployment rates. credit risk also includes the risk that various counterparties that owe us money or product will become insolvent and may breach their obligations. should the counterparties fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements. in that event, our financial results could be adversely affected and incur losses.
the company may at times have direct credit exposure in our short-term wholesale and commodity trading activity to financial institutions trading for their own accounts or issuing collateral support on behalf of other counterparties. we may also have some indirect credit exposure due to participation in organized markets, such as caiso, spp, pjm interconnection, llc, miso and electric reliability council of texas, in which any credit losses are socialized to all market participants. we have additional indirect credit exposure to financial institutions in the form of letters of credit provided as security by power suppliers under various purchased power contracts. if any of the credit ratings of the letter of credit issuers were to drop below investment grade, the supplier would need to replace that security with an acceptable substitute. if the security were not replaced, the party could be in default under the contract.
increasing costs of our defined benefit retirement plans and employee benefits may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
we have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that cover most of our employees. assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements related to these plans. estimates and assumptions may change. in addition, the pension protection act changed the minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans. therefore, our funding requirements and related contributions may change in the future. also, the payout of a significant percentage of pension plan liabilities in a single year due to high numbers of retirements or employees leaving would trigger settlement accounting and could require xcel energy to recognize incremental pension expense related to unrecognized plan losses in the year liabilities are paid.
changes in industry standards utilized in key assumptions (e.g., mortality tables) could have a significant impact on future obligations and benefit costs.
increasing costs associated with health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations.
increasing levels of large individual health care claims and overall health care claims could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. health care legislation could also significantly impact our benefit programs and costs.
we must rely on cash from our subsidiaries to make dividend payments.
investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. substantially all of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries. consequently, our operating cash flow and ability to service our debt and pay dividends depends upon the operating cash flows of our subsidiaries and their payment of dividends.
our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any amounts due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for dividends on our common stock. in addition, each subsidiary's ability to pay dividends depends on statutory and/or contractual restrictions which may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of equity ratios, working capital or assets.
if the utility subsidiaries were to cease making dividend payments, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or otherwise meet our financial obligations could be adversely affected. our utility subsidiaries are regulated by state utility commissions, which possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are met. we may be negatively impacted by the actions of state commissions that limit the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries.
federal tax law may significantly impact our business.
our utility subsidiaries collect through regulated rates estimated federal, state and local tax payments. changes to federal tax law may benefit or adversely affect our earnings and customer costs. tax depreciable lives and the value of various tax credits or the timeliness of their utilization may impact the economics or selection of resources. there could be timing delays before regulated rates provide for realization of tax changes in revenues. in addition, certain irs tax policies, such as tax normalization, may impact our ability to economically deliver certain types of resources relative to market prices.
macroeconomic risks economic conditions impact our business.
xcel energy's operations are affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions, which correlates to customers/sales growth(decline). economic conditions may be impacted by insufficient financial sector liquidity leading to potential increased unemployment, which may impact customers' ability to pay their bills which could lead to additional bad debt expense.
our utility subsidiaries face competitive factors, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. further, worldwide economic activity impacts the demand for basic commodities necessary for utility infrastructure, which may inhibit our ability to acquire sufficient supplies. we operate in a capital intensive industry and federal trade policy could significantly impact the cost of materials we use. there may be delays before these additional material costs can be recovered in rates.
operations could be impacted by war, terrorism, or other events.
our generation plants, fuel storage facilities, transmission and distribution facilities and information and control systems may be targets of terrorist activities. any disruption could impact operations or result in a decrease in revenues and additional costs to repair and insure our assets. these disruptions could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. the potential for terrorism has subjected our operations to increased risks and could have a material effect on our business. we have already incurred increased costs for security and capital expenditures in response to these risks. the insurance industry has also been affected by these events and the availability of insurance may decrease. in addition, insurance may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms.
a disruption of the regional electric transmission grid, interstate natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources, could negatively impact our business, brand and reputation. because our facilities are part of an interconnected system, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the actions of a neighboring utility.
we also face the risks of possible loss of business due to significant events such as severe storm, severe temperature extremes, wildfires (particularly in colorado), widespread pandemic, generator or transmission facility outage, pipeline rupture, railroad disruption, operator error, sudden and significant increase or decrease in wind generation or a disruption of work force within our operating systems (or on a neighboring system).
the recent coronavirus outbreak in china is an example of how major catastrophic events throughout the world may disrupt our business. while we are a domestic company, the company participates in a global supply chain, which includes materials and components that are sourced from china. a prolonged disruption could result in the delay of equipment and materials that may impact our ability to reliably serve our customers.
disruption due to events such as those noted above could result in a significant decrease in revenues and additional costs to repair assets, which could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
xcel energy participates in biennial grid security and emergency response exercises (gridex). these efforts, led by the nerc, test and further develop the coordination, threat sharing and interaction between utilities and various government agencies relative to potential cyber and physical threats against the nation's electric grid.
a cyber incident or security breach could have a material effect on our business.
we operate in an industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology, control systems and network infrastructure. in addition, we use our systems and infrastructure to create, collect, use, disclose, store, dispose of and otherwise process sensitive information, including company data, customer energy usage data, and personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, contractors, shareholders and other individuals.
the company's generation, transmission, distribution and fuel storage facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure or physical assets, as well as information processed in our systems (e.g., information regarding our customers, employees, operations, infrastructure and assets) could be affected by cyber security incidents, including those caused by human error. the utility industry has been the target of several attacks on operational systems and has seen an increased volume and sophistication of cyber security incidents from international activist organizations, nation states and individuals. cyber security incidents could harm our businesses by limiting our generating, transmitting and distributing capabilities, delaying our development and construction of new facilities or capital improvement projects to existing facilities, disrupting our customer operations or causing the release of customer information, all of which would likely receive state and federal regulatory scrutiny and could expose us to liability.
xcel energy's generation, transmission systems and natural gas pipelines are part of an interconnected system. therefore, a disruption caused by the impact of a cyber security incident of the regional electric transmission grid, natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources of our third-party service providers' operations, could also negatively impact our business.
our supply chain for procurement of digital equipment may expose software or hardware to these risks and could result in a breach or significant costs of remediation. we are unable to quantify the potential impact of cyber security threats or subsequent related actions. cyber security incidents and regulatory action could result in a material decrease in revenues and may cause significant additional costs (e.g., penalties, third-party claims, repairs, insurance or compliance) and potentially disrupt our supply and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels.
we maintain security measures to protect our information technology and control systems, network infrastructure and other assets. however, these assets and the information they process may be vulnerable to cyber security incidents, including asset failure or unauthorized access to assets or information.
a failure or breach of our technology systems or those of our third-party service providers could disrupt critical business functions and may negatively impact our business, our brand, and our reputation. the cyber security threat is dynamic and evolves continually, and our efforts to prioritize network protection may not be effective given the constant changes to threat vulnerability.
our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be adversely affected by milder weather.
our electric and natural gas utility businesses are seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance. demand for electricity is often greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating. because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand depends heavily upon weather patterns. a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season. accordingly, our operations have historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. unusually mild winters and summers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
public policy risks we may be subject to legislative and regulatory responses to climate change, with which compliance could be difficult and costly.
legislative and regulatory responses related to climate change and new interpretations of existing laws create financial risk as our facilities may be subject to additional regulation at either the state or federal level in the future. such regulations could impose substantial costs.
we may be subject to climate change lawsuits. an adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures and possibly require payment of substantial penalties or damages. defense costs associated with such litigation can also be significant and could affect results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.
although the united states has not adopted any international or federal ghg emission reduction targets, many states and localities may continue to pursue climate policies in the absence of federal mandates. the steps xcel energy has taken to date to reduce ghg emissions, including energy efficiency measures, adding renewable generation or retiring or converting coal plants to natural gas, occurred under state-endorsed resource plans, renewable energy standards and other state policies. while those actions likely would have put xcel energy in a good position to meet federal or international standards being discussed, the lack of federal action does not adversely impact these state-endorsed actions and plans.
if our regulators do not allow us to recover all or a part of the cost of capital investment or the o&m costs incurred to comply with the mandates, it could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
increased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our business.
the energy act increased civil penalty authority for violation of ferc statutes, rules and orders. the ferc can impose penalties of up to $1.3 million per violation per day, particularly as it relates to energy trading activities for both electricity and natural gas. in addition, nerc electric reliability standards and critical infrastructure protection requirements are mandatory and subject to potential financial penalties. also, the phmsa, occupational safety and health administration and other federal agencies have the authority to assess penalties.
in the event of serious incidents, these agencies have become more active in pursuing penalties. certain states additionally have the authority to impose substantial penalties. if a serious reliability, cyber or safety incident did occur, it could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
environmental risks we are subject to environmental laws and regulations, with which compliance could be difficult and costly.
we are subject to environmental laws and regulations that affect many aspects of our operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges and the generation, transport and disposal of solid wastes and hazardous substances. laws and regulations require us to obtain permits, licenses, and approvals and to comply with a variety of environmental requirements.
environmental laws and regulations can also require us to restrict or limit the output of facilities or the use of certain fuels, shift generation to lower-emitting facilities, install pollution control equipment, clean up spills and other contamination and correct environmental hazards. environmental regulations may also lead to shutdown of existing facilities. failure to meet requirements of environmental mandates may result in fines or penalties. we may be required to pay all or a portion of the cost to remediate (i.e., clean-up) sites where our past activities, or the activities of other parties, caused environmental contamination.
we are subject to mandates to provide customers with clean energy, renewable energy and energy conservation offerings. it could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if our regulators do not allow us to recover the cost of capital investment or the o&m costs incurred to comply with the requirements.
in addition, existing environmental laws or regulations may be revised and new laws or regulations may be adopted. we may also incur additional unanticipated obligations or liabilities under existing environmental laws and regulations.
we are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change and other weather, natural disaster and resource depletion impacts.
climate change can create physical and financial risk. physical risks include changes in weather conditions and extreme weather events.
our customers' energy needs vary with weather. to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers' energy use could increase or decrease. increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in generating assets, transmission and infrastructure. decreased energy use due to weather changes may result in decreased revenues.
climate change may impact a region's economy, which could impact our sales and revenues. the price of energy has an impact on the economic health of our communities. the cost of additional regulatory requirements, such as regulation of ghg, could impact the availability of goods and prices charged by our suppliers which would normally be borne by consumers through higher prices for energy and purchased goods. to the extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of ghgs as a financial risk, this could negatively affect our ability to access capital markets or cause us to receive less than ideal terms and conditions.
severe weather impacts our service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, flooding, tornadoes, wildfires and snow or ice storms occur. extreme weather conditions in general require system backup and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions. extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand may raise electricity prices, increasing the cost of energy we provide to our customers.
to the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service. periods of extreme temperatures could impact our ability to meet demand. changes in precipitation resulting in droughts or water shortages could adversely affect our operations. drought conditions also contribute to the increase in wildfire risk from our electric generation facilities. while we carry liability insurance, given an extreme event, if xcel energy was found to be liable for wildfire damages, amounts that potentially exceed our coverage could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. drought or water depletion could adversely impact our ability to provide electricity to customers, cause early retirement of units and increase the price paid for energy. we may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.
item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non-gaap financial measures the following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with gaap, as well as certain non-gaap financial measures such as ongoing roe, electric margin, natural gas margin, ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted eps. generally, a non-gaap financial measure is a measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are adjusted from measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap.
xcel energy's management uses non-gaap measures for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the board of directors, in determining performance-based compensation, and communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. non-gaap financial measures are intended to supplement investors' understanding of our performance and should not be considered alternatives for financial measures presented in accordance with gaap. these measures are discussed in more detail below and may not be comparable to other companies' similarly titled non-gaap financial measures.
ongoing roe ongoing roe is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of xcel energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by each entity's average stockholder's equity. we use these non-gaap financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results.
electric and natural gas margins electric margin is presented as electric revenues less electric fuel and purchased power expenses. natural gas margin is presented as natural gas revenues less the cost of natural gas sold and transported. expenses incurred for electric fuel and purchased power and the cost of natural gas are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms. as a result, changes in these expenses are generally offset in operating revenues. management believes electric and natural gas margins provide the most meaningful basis for evaluating our operations because they exclude the revenue impact of fluctuations in these expenses.
these margins can be reconciled to operating income, a gaap measure, by including other operating revenues, cost of sales-other, o&m expenses, conservation and dsm expenses, depreciation and amortization and taxes (other than income taxes).
earnings adjusted for certain items (ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted eps)
gaap diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common stock equivalents) were settled. the weighted average number of potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to calculate xcel energy inc.'s diluted eps is calculated using the treasury stock method. ongoing earnings reflect adjustments to gaap earnings (net income) for certain items. ongoing diluted eps is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of each subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted xcel energy inc. common shares outstanding for the period. ongoing diluted eps for each subsidiary is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of such subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted xcel energy inc. common shares outstanding for the period.
we use these non-gaap financial measures to evaluate and provide details of xcel energy's core earnings and underlying performance. we believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our subsidiaries. for the years ended dec. 31, 2019 and dec. 31, 2018, there were no such adjustments to gaap earnings and therefore gaap earnings equal ongoing earnings.

xcel energy's management believes that ongoing earnings reflects management's performance in operating the company and provides a meaningful representation of the performance of xcel energy's core business. in addition, xcel energy's management uses ongoing earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, reporting results to the board of directors and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors.
2019 comparison with 2018
xcel energy - gaap and ongoing earnings increased $0.17 per share. earnings increased as a result of higher electric margins primarily due to non-fuel riders and regulatory rate outcomes, higher natural gas margins and lower o&m expenses, primarily offset by lower afudc, increased depreciation and interest expenses.
psco - earnings increased $0.03 per share for 2019, reflecting higher electric margin due primarily to capital riders and increased natural gas margin attributable to capital riders, weather and sales growth, partially offset by lower afudc driven by the rush creek wind project that was placed in service in 2018 and higher depreciation, interest and o&m.
nsp-minnesota - earnings increased $0.08 per share for 2019, reflecting higher electric margin resulting from regulatory rate outcomes and capital riders and lower o&m, partially offset by increased depreciation.
sps - earnings increased $0.09 per share, reflecting higher electric margin attributable to purchased capacity costs, regulatory rate outcomes and demand revenue and higher afudc, partially offset by increased interest and depreciation.
nsp-wisconsin - earnings decreased $0.04 per share, reflecting lower electric margin, primarily related to sales decline and the impact of unfavorable weather, higher depreciation and lower afudc.
xcel energy inc. and other - xcel energy inc. and other primarily includes financing costs at the holding company.

statement of income analysis the following summarizes the items that affected the individual revenue and expense items reported in the consolidated statements of income.
estimated impact of temperature changes on earnings - unusually hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, while mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales. the estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances, the amount of natural gas or electricity historically used per degree of temperature and excludes any incremental related operating expenses that could result due to storm activity or vegetation management requirements. as a result, weather deviations from normal levels can affect xcel energy's financial performance.
degree-day or thi data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels based on each day's average temperature and humidity. hdd is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below 65° fahrenheit. cdd is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above 65° fahrenheit. each degree of temperature above 65° fahrenheit is counted as one cdd, and each degree of temperature below 65° fahrenheit is counted as one hdd. in xcel energy's more humid service territories, a thi is used in place of cdd, which adds a humidity factor to cdd. hdd, cdd and thi are most likely to impact the usage of xcel energy's residential and commercial customers. industrial customers are less sensitive to weather.
normal weather conditions are defined as either the 20-year or 30-year average of actual historical weather conditions. the historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on regulatory practice. to calculate the impact of weather on demand, a demand factor is applied to the weather impact on sales. extreme weather variations, windchill and cloud cover may not be reflected in weather-normalized estimates.

weather-normalized 2019 electric sales growth (decline)
•   psco - residential sales declined due to lower use per customer, partially offset by an increased number of customers. the decline in c&amp;i was mainly due to lower use per customer, primarily led by customers in the food products and service industries, partially offset by growth in the metal mining and fabricated metal and industries. the decrease in customer use was partially offset by an increase in the number of c&amp;i customers;
•   nsp-minnesota - flat residential sales reflect lower use per customer offset by customer additions. the decline in c&amp;i sales was a result of customer growth being offset by lower use per customer, and certain customers moving to co-generation. decreased sales to c&amp;i customers were driven by the energy and manufacturing sectors;
•   sps - residential sales grew largely due to an increase in customers and higher use per customer. c&amp;i sales grew based on higher use per small c&amp;i customer and an overall increase in the number of c&amp;i customers. in addition, the increase in c&amp;i sales was driven by the oil and natural gas industry in the southeastern new mexico, permian basin area; and
•   nsp-wisconsin - residential sales growth was primarily attributable to customer additions and more use per customer. the decline in c&amp;i sales was largely due to lower use per customer and decreased sales to the frac sand mining, food and manufacturing sectors, which was partially offset by customer additions.
weather-normalized 2019 natural gas sales growth
•   overall natural gas sales reflect an increase in the number of customers combined with higher customer use, particularly c&amp;i at psco. this was partially offset by a decline in c&amp;i sales at nsp-wisconsin, driven by the frac sand mining industry.
weather-normalized sales for 2020 are projected to increase ~1% over 2019 levels for retail electric and natural gas customers, including the impact of leap year.
electric margin electric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are impacted by fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium used in the generation of electricity. however, these price fluctuations have minimal impact on electric margin due to fuel recovery mechanisms that recover fuel expenses. in addition, electric customers receive a credit for ptcs generated in a particular period.

total decrease in o&amp;m expenses                    $(14      )
•   plant generation, transmission and distribution costs were lower due to timing of maintenance activities;
•   nuclear plant operations and amortization were lower largely reflecting improved operating efficiencies and reduced refueling outage costs; and
•   distribution expenses in 2019 were higher than 2018 due to storms, labor and overtime incurred primarily in the first six months of 2019.
depreciation and amortization - depreciation and amortization increased $123 million, or 7%, for 2019. the increase was primarily driven by the rush creek, hale, foxtail and lake benton wind farms going into service, natural gas and distribution/transmission replacements, and various software solutions. these increases were partially offset by higher levels of accelerated amortization of psco's prepaid pension asset in 2018.
taxes (other than income taxes) - taxes (other than income taxes) increased $13 million, or 2.3%, for 2019. the increase was primarily due to higher property taxes in colorado and minnesota (net of deferred amounts).
afudc, equity and debt - afudc decreased $42 million for 2019. the decrease was primarily due to the rush creek wind project being placed in-service in 2018, partially offset by the hale wind project, which went into service in june 2019, and other capital investments.
interest charges - interest charges increased $73 million, or 10.4%, for 2019. the increase was primarily due to higher debt levels to fund capital investments, changes in short-term interest rates and implementation of lease accounting standard (offset in electric margin).
income taxes - income taxes decreased $53 million for 2019, primarily driven by an increase in wind ptcs. wind ptcs are credited to customers (recorded as a reduction to revenue) and do not have a material impact on net income. these were partially offset by higher pretax earnings in 2019 and itcs in 2018. the etr was 8.5% for 2019 compared with 12.6% for the same period in 2018, largely due to the adjustments above.

public utility regulation the ferc and various state and local regulatory commissions regulate xcel energy inc.'s utility subsidiaries and wgi. xcel energy is subject to rate regulation by state utility regulatory agencies, which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and natural gas distribution companies in minnesota, north dakota, south dakota, wisconsin, michigan, colorado, new mexico, and texas.
rates are designed to recover plant investment, operating costs and an allowed return on investment. our utility subsidiaries request changes in rates for utility services through filings with governing commissions. changes in operating costs can affect xcel energy's financial results, depending on the timing of rate case filings and implementation of final rates. other factors affecting rate filings are new investments, sales, conservation and dsm efforts, and the cost of capital.
in addition, the regulatory commissions authorize the roe, capital structure and depreciation rates in rate proceedings. decisions by these regulators can significantly impact xcel energy's results of operations.

purchased power arrangements and transmission service provider nsp-minnesota expects to use power plants, power purchases, cip/dsm options, new generation facilities and expansion of power plants to meet its system capacity requirements.
purchased power - nsp-minnesota has contracts to purchase power from other utilities and ipps. long-term purchased power contracts for dispatchable resources typically require a capacity and an energy charge. nsp-minnesota makes short-term purchases to meet system requirements, replace company owned generation, meet operating reserve obligations or obtain energy at a lower cost.
ppa terminations and amendments - in june 2018, nsp-minnesota terminated the benson and laurentian ppas, and purchased the benson biomass facility. as a result, a $103 million regulatory asset was recognized for the costs of the benson transaction. for laurentian, a regulatory asset of $109 million was recognized for annual termination payments/obligations. regulatory approvals provide for recovery of the benson regulatory asset over 10 years and laurentian termination payments as they occur (over six years). termination of the ppas is expected to save customers over $600 million throughout the next 10 years.
purchased transmission services - nsp-minnesota and nsp-wisconsin have contracts with miso and other regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to their customers.
minnesota state rofr statute complaint - in september 2017, lsp transmission filed a complaint in the minnesota district court against the minnesota attorney general, mpuc and doc. the complaint was in response to miso assigning nsp-minnesota and itc midwest, llc to jointly own a new 345 kv transmission line from mankato to winnebago, minnesota.
the project was estimated to cost $108 million and projected to be in-service by the end of 2021. it was assigned to nsp-minnesota and itc midwest as the incumbent utilities, consistent with a minnesota state rofr statute. the complaint challenged the constitutionality of the statute and is seeking declaratory judgment that the statute violates the commerce clause of the u.s. constitution and should not be enforced. the minnesota state agencies and nsp-minnesota filed motions to dismiss.
in june 2018, the minnesota district court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss with prejudice. lsp transmission filed an appeal in july 2018. in september 2019, the estimate was updated to approximately $140 million, due to various changes in build plans. in october 2019, oral arguments were held with the eighth circuit court of appeals. a decision is expected in the first or second quarter of 2020.
nuclear power operations and waste disposal nuclear power plant operations produce gaseous, liquid and solid radioactive wastes, which are covered by federal regulation. high-level radioactive wastes primarily include used nuclear fuel. low-level waste consists primarily of demineralizer resins, paper, protective clothing, rags, tools and equipment contaminated through use.
nrc regulation - the nrc regulates nuclear operations. costs of complying with nrc requirements can affect both operating expenses and capital investments of the plants. nsp-minnesota has obtained recovery of these compliance costs and expects to recover future compliance costs.
low-level waste disposal - low level waste disposal from monticello and pi is disposed at the clive facility located in utah and the waste control specialists facility in texas. nsp-minnesota has storage capacity available on-site at pi and monticello which would allow both plants to continue to operate until the end of their current licensed lives if of-site low-level waste disposal facilities become unavailable.
high-level radioactive waste disposal - the federal government has responsibility to permanently dispose domestic spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive wastes. the nuclear waste policy act requires the doe to implement a program for nuclear high-level waste management. this includes the siting, licensing, construction and operation of a repository for spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear power reactors and other high-level radioactive wastes at a permanent federal storage or disposal facility. the federal government has been evaluating a nuclear geologic repository at yucca mountain, nevada for many years. currently, there are no definitive plans for a permanent federal storage facility site.
nuclear spent fuel storage - nsp-minnesota has interim on-site storage for spent nuclear fuel at its monticello and pi nuclear generating plants. authorized storage capacity is sufficient to allow nsp-minnesota to operate until the end of the operating licenses in 2030 for monticello, 2033 for pi unit 1, and 2034 for pi unit 2. authorizations for additional spent fuel storage capacity may be required at each site to support either continued operation or decommissioning if the federal government does not commence storage operations.
wholesale and commodity marketing operations nsp-minnesota conducts wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, ancillary services and energy-related products. nsp-minnesota uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price and credit risk and hedge sales and purchases.
nsp-minnesota also engages in trading activity unrelated to hedging. sharing of any margins is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the ferc approved joa. nsp-minnesota does not serve any wholesale requirements customers at cost-based regulated rates.

the request reflects $1.3 billion of capital additions since the 2016 test year used to set current rates. capital investments are made to maintain the safety and reliability of the natural gas system, along with investments to connect new customers and perform mandated infrastructure relocation work.
timing of a cpuc ruling is expected in the second half of 2020.
resource plan cep - in september 2018, the cpuc approved psco's cep portfolio, which included the retirement of two coal-fired generation units, comanche unit 1 (in 2022) and comanche unit 2 (in 2025), and the following additions:
total capacity   psco's ownership wind generation                1,100 mw   500 mw solar generation                 700 mw   -
battery storage                  275 mw   -
natural gas generation           380 mw   380 mw psco's investment is expected to be approximately $1 billion, including transmission to support the increase in renewable generation.
cpcns were granted by the cpuc for the shortgrass substation in february 2019, and for the 500 mw cheyenne ridge wind farm and 345 kv generation tie line in april 2019.
a cpcn for the acquisitions of the valmont and manchief natural gas generation facilities was filed in july 2019, and a settlement on those acquisitions was reached with cpuc staff and the colorado office of consumer counsel in january 2020, pending a cpuc decision expected in approximately the second quarter of 2020.
a cpcn for voltage control facilities was also filed with the cpuc in december 2019, with another expected to follow in approximately the first quarter of 2020 for network transmission upgrades required for the cep portfolio.
purchased power and transmission service providers psco expects to meet its system capacity requirements through electric generating stations, power purchases, new generation facilities, dsm options and expansion of generation plants.
purchased power - psco purchases power from other utilities and ipps. long-term purchased power contracts for dispatchable resources typically require capacity and energy charges. it also contracts to purchase power for both wind and solar resources. psco makes short-term purchases to meet system load and energy requirements, replace owned generation, meet operating reserve obligations, or obtain energy at a lower cost.
purchased transmission services - in addition to using its own transmission system, psco has contracts with regional transmission service providers to deliver energy to its customers.
boulder municipalization in 2011, boulder passed a ballot measure authorizing the formation of an electric municipal utility, subject to certain conditions. subsequently, there have been various legal proceedings in multiple venues with jurisdiction over boulder's plan. in 2014, the boulder city council passed an ordinance to establish an electric utility. psco challenged the formation of this utility and the colorado court of appeals ruled in psco's favor, vacating a lower court decision. in june 2018, the colorado supreme court rejected boulder's request to dismiss the case and remanded it to the boulder district court. the case was then settled in june 2019 after boulder agreed to repeal the ordinance establishing the utility.
boulder has filed multiple separation applications with the cpuc, which have been challenged by psco and other intervenors. in september 2017, the cpuc issued a written decision, agreeing with several key aspects of psco's position. the cpuc has approved the designation of some electrical distribution assets for transfer, subject to boulder completing certain filings.
in the fourth quarter of 2018, the boulder city council also adopted an ordinance authorizing boulder to begin negotiations for the acquisition of certain property or to otherwise condemn that property after feb. 1, 2019. in the first quarter of 2019, boulder sent psco a notice of intent to acquire certain electric distribution assets. in the third quarter of 2019, boulder filed its condemnation litigation, which was later dismissed by the boulder district court in september 2019 on the grounds that boulder had not completed the pre-requisite cpuc process and filings. boulder is currently appealing this order. in october 2019, the cpuc approved the subsequent filings regarding asset transfers outside of substations, reaffirmed its 2017 decision on assets outside of substations and closed the cpuc proceeding.
in december 2019, boulder filed a new condemnation action despite its ongoing appeal of the last condemnation case. psco subsequently filed a motion to dismiss or stay the new condemnation action. in february 2020, boulder filed an application under section 210 of the federal power act asking ferc to order psco to interconnect its facilities with a future boulder municipal utility under boulder's preferred terms and conditions.
wholesale and commodity marketing operations psco conducts various wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, ancillary services and energy related products. psco uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price and credit risk and hedge sales and purchases. psco also engages in trading activity unrelated to hedging. sharing of any margin is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the ferc approved joa.

resource plan in december 2018, the nmprc issued a final order accepting sps' irp.
sps is forecasting a surplus capacity of 382 mw in 2028, but a capacity deficit of approximately 2,896 mw in 2038. sps' optimal resource plan for the planning period incorporates the addition of wind, simple cycle combustion turbine generation, combined cycle energy and entering ppas. various factors may impact this irp, which could potentially require updates to the action plan and will be the subject of future irps, including:
•   new and revised environmental regulations;
•   impacts of variability due to participation in the spp;
•   customer expectations;
•   technological advances;
•   groundwater aquifer depletion at sps's tolk station;
•   aging generation fleet;
•   load growth and gas price variability;
•   changes to tax credits and incentives; and
•   changes to renewable portfolio standard acquisitions.
sps is required to file an irp in new mexico every three years and will file its next irp in july 2021.
texas state rofr in may 2019, the governor signed into law senate bill 1938, which grants incumbent utilities a rofr to build transmission infrastructure when it directly interconnects to the utility's existing facility. in june 2019, a complaint was filed in the united states district court for the western district of texas claiming the new rofr law to be unconstitutional. the texas attorney general has made a motion to dismiss the federal court complaint. a ruling on the dismissal motion is expected in the first quarter of 2020.
purchased power arrangements and transmission service providers sps expects to use electric generating stations, power purchases, dsm and new generation options to meet its system capacity requirements.
purchased power - sps purchases power from other utilities and ipps. long-term purchased power contracts typically require periodic capacity and energy charges. sps also makes short-term purchases to meet system load and energy requirements to replace owned generation, meet operating reserve obligations or obtain energy at a lower cost.
purchased transmission services - sps has contractual arrangements with spp and regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to its native load customers.
natural gas sps does not provide retail natural gas service, but purchases and transports natural gas for its generation facilities and operates natural gas pipeline facilities connecting the generation facilities to interstate natural gas pipelines. sps is subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc with respect to natural gas transactions in interstate commerce and the phmsa and puct for pipeline safety compliance.
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the application of accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. these judgments could materially impact the consolidated financial statements, based on varying assumptions. in addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect on the operation of the business and results reported.
accounting policies and estimates that are most significant to xcel energy's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are outlined below. each of these has a higher likelihood of resulting in materially different reported amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions. each critical accounting policy has been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of xcel energy inc.'s board of directors on a quarterly basis.
regulatory accounting xcel energy is subject to the accounting for regulated operations, which provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if it is probable that such rates will be charged and collected. our rates are derived through the ratemaking process, which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on the probability of future cash flows. regulatory assets generally represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because future recovery from customers is probable. regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for future costs. in other businesses or industries, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities would generally be charged to net income or other comprehensive income.
each reporting period we assess the probability of future recoveries and obligations associated with regulatory assets and liabilities. factors such as the current regulatory environment, recently issued rate orders and historical precedents are considered. decisions made by regulatory agencies can directly impact the amount and timing of cost recovery as well as the rate of return on invested capital, and may materially impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
as of dec. 31, 2019 and 2018, xcel energy recorded regulatory assets of $3.4 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, and regulatory liabilities of $5.5 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively. each subsidiary is subject to regulation that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. if future recovery of costs in any such jurisdiction is no longer probable, xcel energy would be required to charge these assets to current net income or other comprehensive income. in assessing the probability of recovery of recognized regulatory assets, xcel energy noted no current or anticipated proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that it expects will materially impact the probability of recovery of the assets.
see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
income tax accruals judgment, uncertainty and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax accrual process that accounts for the effects of current and deferred income taxes. uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and outcomes of tax audits and appeals require that judgment and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of the etr.
changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future etr. etr calculations are revised every quarter based on best available year-end tax assumptions, adjusted in the following year after returns are filed. the tax accrual estimates are trued-up to the actual amounts claimed on the tax returns and further adjusted after examinations by taxing authorities, as needed.
in accordance with the interim period reporting guidance, income tax expense for the first three quarters in a year is based on the forecasted annual etr. the forecasted etr reflects a number of estimates, including forecasted annual income, permanent tax adjustments and tax credits.
valuation allowances are applied to deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that at least a portion may not be realized based on an evaluation of expected future taxable income. accounting for income taxes also requires that only tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold can be recognized or continue to be recognized. we may adjust our unrecognized tax benefits and interest accruals as disputes with the irs and state tax authorities are resolved, and as new developments occur. these adjustments may increase or decrease earnings.
see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
employee benefits we sponsor several noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans that cover almost all employees and certain retirees. projected benefit costs are based on historical information and actuarial calculations that include key assumptions (annual return level on pension and postretirement health care investment assets, discount rates, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates, etc.). in addition, the pension cost calculation uses a methodology to reduce the volatility of investment performance over time. pension assumptions are continually reviewed.
at dec. 31, 2019, xcel energy set the rate of return on assets used to measure pension costs at 6.87%, which is consistent with the rate set in 2018. the rate of return used to measure postretirement health care costs is 4.50% at dec. 31, 2019, which represents a 80 basis point decrease from 2018. xcel energy's pension investment strategy is based on plan-specific investments that seek to minimize investment and interest rate risk as a plan's funded status increases over time. this strategy results in a greater percentage of interest rate sensitive securities being allocated to plans with a higher funded status and a greater percentage of growth assets being allocated to plans having a lower funded status ratios.
xcel energy set the discount rates used to value the pension obligations at 3.49% and postretirement health care obligations at 3.47% at dec. 31, 2019. this represents a 82 basis point and 85 basis point decrease, respectively, from 2018. xcel energy uses a bond matching study as its primary basis for determining the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement health care obligations. the bond matching study utilizes a portfolio of high grade (aa or higher) bonds that matches the expected cash flows of xcel energy's benefit plans in amount and duration.
the effective yield on this cash flow matched bond portfolio determines the discount rate for the individual plans. the bond matching study is validated for reasonableness against the merrill lynch corporate 15+ bond index. in addition, xcel energy reviews general actuarial survey data to assess the reasonableness of the discount rate selected.
if xcel energy were to use alternative assumptions, a 1% change would result in the following impact on 2019 pension costs:
pension costs
(millions of dollars)   +1%                     -1%
rate of return          $(16      )         $18
discount rate (a)       (5        )   9
(a)   these costs include the effects of regulation.
mortality rates are developed from actual and projected plan experience for pension plan and postretirement benefits. xcel energy's actuary conducts an experience study periodically as part of the process to determine an estimate of mortality. xcel energy considers standard mortality tables, improvement factors and the plans actual experience when selecting a best estimate.
as of dec. 31, 2019, the initial medical trend cost claim assumptions for pre-65 was 6.0% and post-65 was 5.1%. the ultimate trend assumption remained at 4.5% for both pre-65 and post-65 claims costs. xcel energy bases its medical trend assumption on the long-term cost inflation expected in the health care market, considering the levels projected and recommended by industry experts, as well as recent actual medical cost experienced by xcel energy's retiree medical plan.
a 1% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects on xcel energy:
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation         service and interest components
(millions of dollars)    +1%                                 -1%               +1%                       -1%
health care cost trend   $51                                 $(43)             $2                        $(2)
funding requirements in 2020 were $150 million and are expected to decline in the following years. investment returns exceeded assumed levels in 2017 and 2019 and were below assumed levels in 2018.
the pension cost calculation uses a market-related valuation of pension assets. xcel energy uses a calculated value method to determine the market-related value of the plan assets. the market-related value is determined by adjusting the fair market value of assets at the beginning of the year to reflect the investment gains and losses (the difference between the actual investment return and the expected investment return on the market-related value) during each of the previous five years at the rate of 20% per year. as differences between actual and expected investment returns are incorporated into the market-related value, amounts are recognized in pension cost over the expected average remaining years of service for active employees (approximately 12 years in 2019).
xcel energy currently projects the pension costs recognized for financial reporting purposes will be $104 million in 2020 and $90 million in 2021, while the actual pension costs were $115 million in 2019 and $141 million in 2018. the expected decrease in 2020 and future year costs is primarily due to the reductions in loss amortizations.
pension funding contributions across all four of xcel energy's pension plans, both voluntary and required, for 2017 - 2020:
•   $150 million in january 2020;
•   $154 million in 2019;
•   $150 million in 2018; and
•   $162 million in 2017.
future amounts may change based on actual market performance, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations. therefore, additional contributions could be required in the future.
xcel energy contributed $15 million, $11 million and $20 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, to the postretirement health care plans. xcel energy expects to contribute approximately $10 million during 2020. xcel energy recovers employee benefits costs in its utility operations consistent with accounting guidance with the exception of the areas noted below.
•   nsp-minnesota recognizes pension expense in all regulatory jurisdictions using the aggregate normal cost actuarial method. differences between aggregate normal cost and expense as calculated by pension accounting standards are deferred as a regulatory liability;
•   in 2018, the pscw approved nsp-wisconsin's request for deferred accounting treatment of the 2018 pension settlement accounting expense;
•   regulatory commissions in colorado, texas, new mexico and ferc jurisdictions allow the recovery of other postretirement benefit costs only to the extent that recognized expense is matched by cash contributions to an irrevocable trust. xcel energy has consistently funded at a level to allow full recovery of costs in these jurisdictions;
•   psco and sps recognize pension expense in all regulatory jurisdictions based on expense consistent with accounting guidance. the texas and colorado electric retail jurisdictions and the colorado gas retail jurisdiction, each record the difference between annual recognized pension expense and the annual amount of pension expense approved in their last respective general rate case as a deferral to a regulatory asset; and
•   in 2018, psco was required to create a regulatory liability to adjust postretirement health care costs to zero in order to match the amounts collected in rates in the colorado gas retail jurisdiction.

nuclear decommissioning xcel energy recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists. these aros are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. in the absence of quoted market prices, xcel energy estimates the fair value of its aros using present value techniques, in which it makes assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. when the company revises any assumptions, it adjusts the carrying amount of both the aro liability and related long-lived asset. aro liabilities are accreted to reflect the passage of time using the interest method.
a significant portion of xcel energy's aros relates to the future decommissioning of nsp-minnesota's nuclear facilities. the nuclear decommissioning obligation is funded by the external decommissioning trust fund. difference between regulatory funding (including depreciation expense less returns from the external trust fund) and expense recognized is deferred as a regulatory asset. the amounts recorded for aros related to future nuclear decommissioning were $2.1 billion in 2019 and $2.0 billion in 2018.
nsp-minnesota obtains periodic independent cost studies in order to estimate the cost and timing of planned nuclear decommissioning activities. estimates of future cash flows are highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. nsp-minnesota is required to file a nuclear decommissioning filing every three years. the filing covers all expenses for the decommissioning of the nuclear plants, including decontamination and removal of radioactive material.
the most recent triennial filing was approved by the mpuc in january 2019. this approval did not result in a change to the aro liability. in december 2019, the mpuc ordered xcel energy to maintain the current accrual through 2020 to align with the approved one year stay out of the previously filed three-year electric rate case. xcel energy will evaluate the scenarios and potentially propose a new accrual starting in 2022 when it submits the next triennial filing in december 2020.
the following assumptions have a significant effect on the estimated nuclear obligation:
timing - decommissioning cost estimates are impacted by each facility's retirement date and timing of the actual decommissioning activities. estimated retirement dates coincide with the expiration of each unit's operating license with the nrc (i.e., 2030 for monticello and 2033 and 2034 for pi's unit 1 and 2, respectively). the estimated timing of the decommissioning activities is based upon the decon method, which assumes prompt removal and dismantlement. the use of the decon method is required by the mpuc. decommissioning activities are expected to begin at the end of the license date and be completed for both facilities by 2091.
technology and regulation - there is limited experience with actual decommissioning of large nuclear facilities. changes in technology, experience and regulations could cause cost estimates to change significantly.
escalation rates - escalation rates represent projected cost increases due to general inflation and increases in the cost of decommissioning activities. nsp-minnesota used an escalation rate of 3.4% in calculating the aro for nuclear decommissioning of its nuclear facilities, based on the weighted averages of labor and non-labor escalation factors calculated by goldman sachs asset management.
discount rates - changes in timing or estimated cash flows that result in upward revisions to the aro are calculated using the then-current credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. the credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect when the change occurs is used to discount the revised estimate of the incremental expected cash flows of the retirement activity.
if the change in timing or estimated expected cash flows results in a downward revision of the aro, the undiscounted revised estimate of expected cash flows is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect at the date of initial measurement and recognition of the original aro. discount rates ranging from approximately 4% to 7% have been used to calculate the net present value of the expected future cash flows over time.
significant uncertainties exist in estimating future costs including the method to be utilized, ultimate costs to decommission and planned method of disposing spent fuel. if different cost estimates, life assumptions or cost escalation rates were utilized, the aros could change materially.
however, changes in estimates have minimal impact on results of operations as nsp-minnesota expects to continue to recover all costs in future rates.
the company continually makes judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting policy areas, based on an evaluation of the assumptions and uncertainties for each area. the information and assumptions of these judgments and estimates will be affected by events beyond the control of xcel energy, or otherwise change over time. this may require adjustments to recorded results to better reflect updated information that becomes available. the accompanying financial statements reflect management's best estimates and judgments of the impact of these factors as of dec. 31, 2019.

derivatives, risk management and market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks in the normal course of business. market risk is the potential loss that may occur as a result of adverse changes in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity. all financial and commodity-related instruments, including derivatives, are subject to market risk.
xcel energy is also exposed to the impact of adverse changes in price for energy and energy-related products, which is partially mitigated by the use of commodity derivatives. in addition to ongoing monitoring and maintaining credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk, management takes steps to mitigate changes in credit and concentration risks associated with its derivatives and other contracts, including parental guarantees and requests of collateral. while we expect that the counterparties will perform under the contracts underlying its derivatives, the contracts expose us to certain credit and non-performance risk.
distress in the financial markets may impact counterparty risk, the fair value of the securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund and pension fund and xcel energy's ability to earn a return on short-term investments.
commodity price risk - we are exposed to commodity price risk in their electric and natural gas operations. commodity price risk is managed by entering into long- and short-term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric capacity, energy and energy-related products and fuels used in generation and distribution activities. commodity price risk is also managed through the use of financial derivative instruments. our risk management policy allows it to manage commodity price risk within each rate-regulated operation per commission approved hedge plans.
wholesale and commodity trading risk - xcel energy conducts various wholesale and commodity trading activities, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, energy-related instruments and natural gas-related instruments, including derivatives. our risk management policy allows management to conduct these activities within guidelines and limitations as approved by its risk management committee.

at dec. 31, 2019, a 10% increase in market prices for commodity trading contracts would increase pretax income by approximately $10 million, whereas a 10% decrease would decrease pretax income by approximately $10 million. at dec. 31, 2018, a 10% increase in market prices for commodity trading contracts would increase pretax income by approximately $16 million, whereas a 10% decrease would decrease pretax income by approximately $16 million.
the utility subsidiaries' commodity trading operations measure the outstanding risk exposure to price changes on contracts and obligations that have been entered into, but not closed, using an industry standard methodology known as var. var expresses the potential change in fair value on the outstanding contracts and obligations over a particular period of time under normal market conditions.
the vars for the nsp-minnesota and psco commodity trading operations, excluding both non-derivative transactions and derivative transactions designated as normal purchase, normal sales, calculated on a consolidated basis using a monte carlo simulation with a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period, were as follows:
(millions of dollars)           year endeddec. 31             var limit            average              high               low

in november 2018, management temporarily increased the var limit to accommodate a 10-year transaction. nsp-minnesota systematically hedging the transaction and the consolidated var returned below $3 million in early january 2019.
nuclear fuel supply - nsp-minnesota has received all enriched nuclear material for 2019 and has contracted for approximately 51% of its 2020 enriched nuclear material requirements from sources that could be impacted by sanctions against entities doing business with iran. those sanctions may impact the supply of enriched nuclear material supplied from russia. long-term, through 2030, nsp-minnesota is scheduled to take delivery of approximately 29% of its average enriched nuclear material requirements from these sources. alternate potential sources provide the flexibility to manage nsp-minnesota's nuclear fuel supply. nsp-minnesota periodically assesses if further actions are required to assure a secure supply of enriched nuclear material.
interest rate risk - xcel energy is subject to interest rate risk. our risk management policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps, collars and put or call options.
36
a 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on xcel energy's variable rate debt would impact annual pretax interest expense by approximately $6 million in 2019 and $10 million in 2018.
nsp-minnesota maintains a nuclear decommissioning fund, as required by the nrc. the nuclear decommissioning fund is subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk. the fund is invested in a diversified portfolio of cash equivalents, debt securities, equity securities and other investments. these investments may be used only for the purpose of decommissioning nsp-minnesota's nuclear generating plants.
realized and unrealized gains on the decommissioning fund investments are deferred as an offset of nsp-minnesota's regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning costs. fluctuations in equity prices or interest rates affecting the nuclear decommissioning fund do not have a direct impact on earnings due to the application of regulatory accounting.
changes in discount rates and expected return on plan assets impact the value of pension and postretirement plan assets and/or benefit costs.
credit risk - xcel energy is also exposed to credit risk. credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from counterparties' nonperformance on their contractual obligations. the company maintains credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitor these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations.
at dec. 31, 2019, a 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $19 million, while a decrease in prices of 10% would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $14 million. at dec. 31, 2018, a 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $14 million, while a decrease in prices of 10% would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $3 million.
xcel energy conducts credit reviews for all counterparties and employs credit risk controls, such as letters of credit, parental guarantees, master netting agreements and termination provisions. credit exposure is monitored, and when necessary, the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided. distress in the financial markets could increase our credit risk.
fair value measurements xcel energy uses derivative contracts such as futures, forwards, interest rate swaps, options and ftrs to manage commodity price and interest rate risk. derivative contracts, with the exception of those designated as normal purchase-normal sale contracts, are reported at fair value. the company's investments held in the nuclear decommissioning fund, rabbi trusts, pension and other postretirement funds are also subject to fair value accounting.
commodity derivatives - xcel energy monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties to its commodity derivative contracts and assesses each counterparty's ability to perform on the transactions. the impact of discounting commodity derivative assets for counterparty credit risk was not material to the fair value of commodity derivative assets at dec. 31, 2019.
adjustments to fair value for credit risk of commodity trading instruments are recorded in electric revenues. credit risk adjustments for other commodity derivative instruments are recorded as other comprehensive income or deferred as regulatory assets and liabilities. classification as a regulatory asset or liability is based on commission approved regulatory recovery mechanisms. the impact of discounting commodity derivative liabilities for credit risk was immaterial at dec. 31, 2019.

common stock dividends - future dividend levels will be dependent on xcel energy's results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reinvestment opportunities and other factors, and will be evaluated by the xcel energy inc. board of directors. in february 2020, xcel energy announced a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share, which represents an increase of 6.2%.
xcel energy's dividend policy balances the following:
•   projected cash generation;
•   projected capital investment;
•   a reasonable rate of return on shareholder investment; and
•   the impact on xcel energy's capital structure and credit ratings.
in addition, there are certain statutory limitations that could affect dividend levels. federal law places limits on the ability of public utilities within a holding company system to declare dividends. specifically, under the federal power act, a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in a capital account. the utility subsidiaries' dividends may be limited directly or indirectly by state regulatory commissions or bond indenture covenants.

earnings guidance
2020 gaap and ongoing earnings guidance is a range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share.(a)
key assumptions:
•   constructive outcomes in all rate case and regulatory proceedings.
•   normal weather patterns.
•   weather-normalized retail electric sales are projected to increase ~1%, including impact of leap year.
•   weather-normalized retail firm natural gas sales are projected to increase ~1%, including impact of leap year.
•   capital rider revenue is projected to increase $45 million to $55 million (net of ptcs). ptcs are credited to customers, through capital riders and reductions to electric margin.
•   o&amp;m expenses are projected to increase approximately 1% to 2%.
•   depreciation expense is projected to increase approximately $160 million to $170 million.
•   property taxes are projected to increase approximately $35 million to $45 million.
•   interest expense (net of afudc - debt) is projected to increase $50 million to $60 million.
•   afudc - equity is projected to increase approximately $10 million to $20 million.
•   the etr is projected to be approximately 0%. the etr reflects benefits of ptcs which are credited to customers through electric margin and will not impact net income.
(a)   ongoing earnings is calculated using net income and adjusting for certain nonrecurring or infrequent items that are, in management's view, not reflective of ongoing operations. ongoing earnings could differ from those prepared in accordance with gaap for unplanned and/or unknown adjustments. xcel energy is unable to forecast if any of these items will occur or provide a quantitative reconciliation of the guidance for ongoing eps to corresponding gaap eps.
off-balance sheet arrangements xcel energy does not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements, other than those currently disclosed, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

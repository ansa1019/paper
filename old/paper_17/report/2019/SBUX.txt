item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k, including the management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. moreover, the risks below are not the only risks we face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at any time and may negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock.
•   economic conditions in the u.s. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results.
as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macro-economic conditions. our customers may have or in the future have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or switch to starbucks or competitors' lower-priced products as a result of various factors, including job losses, inflation, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, changes in federal economic policy and recent international trade disputes. decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results. there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or there may be a general downturn in the restaurant industry.
•   our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results.
we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our global social impact programs. the starbucks brand is recognized throughout the world, and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. to be successful in the future, particularly outside of the u.s. where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities.
business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value, potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability and can have a negative impact on our financial results. such incidents include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws, contaminated food, product recalls, store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section. the impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation. consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we, our employees, licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, racially-biased, unequal or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of customers at starbucks stores, or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes. additionally, if we fail to comply with laws and regulations, publicly take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets, including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well, our brand value may be diminished.
•   if our business partners and third-party providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, it could damage our brand and our financial results could suffer.
our global business strategy, including our plans for new stores, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, particularly for our entire global channel development business. licensees, retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage and other products directly to customers. we believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or company-operated store, so we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these licensees and other business partners. however, the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control.
we also source our food, beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. and although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business, we do not monitor the quality of non-starbucks products served in those locations. additionally, inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property, can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material negative impact on our financial results.
•   incidents involving food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, could harm our business.
instances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply or food-safety issues, such as food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors. any report linking us to such instances could severely hurt our sales and could possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) and/or temporary store closures. clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea and other beverages, as well as ice for our cold beverages, and our ability to ensure a clean water and ice supply to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. we are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration, which increases the risk of food safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained due to mechanical malfunction or human error.
we also face risk by relying on third-party food suppliers to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to our stores. we monitor the operations of certain of these business partners, but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control and it may be difficult to detect contamination or other defect in these products.
additionally, we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers. in addition, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could, by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general, adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis. a decrease in customer traffic as a result of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, product recalls or food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, could materially harm our business and results of operations.
•   the unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of starbucks proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.
many of our information technology systems (and those of our licensees and other third-party business partners, whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers), including those used for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services and rewards programs, and administrative functions, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees. many of our information technology systems also contain starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans, product development initiatives and designs. similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we are consistently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems. to the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third parties' information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of customers' or employees' data or confidential information of the company stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, our ability to retain or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans. such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable u.s. and international privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer, business partner, or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. for example, the european union adopted a new regulation that became effective in may 2018, called the general data protection regulation ("gdpr"), which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. failure to meet the gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenue. the gdpr also confers a private right of action on certain individuals and associations. additionally, the california privacy act of 2018 ("ccpa"), which was enacted in june 2018 and will come into effect on january 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly respond to security breaches of our or third party's information technology systems. such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability.
compliance with the gdpr, the ccpa and other current and future applicable international and u.s. privacy, cybersecurity and related laws can be costly and time-consuming. significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to remedy cybersecurity problems and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. these costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems.
media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third-party business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business. additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breach information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. we continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.
•   we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and growth initiatives, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results.
we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, starbucks cards, online business, delivery services, mobile technology, including mobile payments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions, and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality. additionally, the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth, including our ability to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend, is highly dependent on our technology systems. we also rely on third-party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. additionally, our systems hardware, software and services provided by third-party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets. although we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or third party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyber-attacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our third-party business partners' or service providers' systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section. if our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results. in addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses.
•   we may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. these strategic initiatives are designed to create growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include:
•   being an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience;
•   building our leadership position around coffee;
•   driving convenience, brand engagement and digital relationships through our mobile, loyalty, delivery and digital capabilities both domestically and internationally;
•   simplifying store administrative tasks to allow store partners to better engage with customers;
•   increasing the scale of the starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats;
•   moving to a more licensed store model in some markets and a more company-owned model in other markets;
•   creating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings, including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup;
•   continuing the global growth of our channel development business through our supply, distribution and licensing agreements with nestlé and other channel development business partners;
•   delivering continued growth in our cold beverage business, including our tea business through the teavana brand in our starbucks® retail stores and other channels and internationally; and
•   reducing our operating costs, particularly general and administrative expenses.
in addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section, factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results, include the following:
•   imposition of additional taxes by jurisdictions, such as on certain types of beverages or based on number of employees;
•   construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores; delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the u.s. and internationally;
•   not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as our product offerings increase and as we continue to expand, including our emphasis on a broad range of high-quality food offerings; and
•   the deterioration in our credit ratings, which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives.
effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, philosophy and standards. if we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives, such as large acquisitions and integrations, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. in the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results.
•   evolving consumer preferences and tastes may adversely affect our business.
our continued success depends on our ability to retain and convert customers. our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outside-the-home food and beverages (such as the disruption caused by on-line commerce that results in reduced foot traffic to "brick & mortar" retail stores); lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the teavana brand in our starbucks® retail stores and other channels) and platforms (such as features of our mobile technology, changes in our loyalty rewards programs and our delivery services initiatives); or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced. in addition, some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects. particularly in the u.s., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. while we have a variety of beverage and food items, including items that are coffee-free and have reduced calories, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations.
•   our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations.
the growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations as well as on the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop and negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of, and enforce, commercial and other agreements and the performance of our business partners under such agreements. our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market. our channel development business is heavily reliant on nestlé, which acquired the right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. if nestlé fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect and grow our brand in channel development, our channel development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our channel development business and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. additionally, the growth of our channel development business is in part dependent on the level of discretionary support provided by our retail and licensed store businesses.
there are generally a relatively small number of licensee partners operating in specific markets. if they are not able to access sufficient funds or financing, or are otherwise unable to successfully operate and grow their businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the markets.
•   changes in the availability of and the cost of labor could adversely affect our business.
increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most significant costs, both domestically and internationally, including those increases triggered by regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling and benefits; increased health care and workers' compensation insurance costs and increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets. furthermore, the growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees, to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience which could materially harm our business and results of operations.
•   we face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability.
the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience, such as delivery service and mobile ordering, and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all these areas in each of our channels and markets. accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. in the u.s., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to starbucks® stores and/or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors, or competition from large new entrants or well-funded smaller companies in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world, which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets. increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment. furthermore, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products or flattening demand for our products, could have a negative effect on our business.
•   we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our americas operating segment.
our financial performance is highly dependent on our americas operating segment, as it comprised approximately 69% of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2019. if the americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline, especially in our u.s. market, our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. and because the americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows, such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international businesses and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders.
•   we are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets.
our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets. some or all of our international market business units ("mbus"), which we generally define by the countries in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth, which ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. the performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large mbus operate. a decline in performance of one or more of our significant international mbus could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results.
the international segment is a significant profit center driving our global returns, along with our americas segment. in particular, our china mbu contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and international net revenues and operating income. china is currently our fastest growing market and second largest market overall. with our acquisition of the east china business, the china market is 100% company-owned. due to the significance of our china market for our profit and growth, we are exposed to risks in china, including the risks mentioned elsewhere and the following:
•   the effects of current u.s.-china relations, including rounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing restrictive regulations, potential boycotts and increasing anti-americanism;
•   entry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in china;
•   changes in economic conditions in china and potential negative effects to the growth of its middle class, wages, labor, inflation discretionary spending and real estate and supply chain costs;
•   ongoing government regulatory reform, including relating to food safety, tariffs and tax, bringing uncertainty and inconsistent interpretations, which may be contrary to ours, as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs;
•   food-safety related matters, including compliance with food-safety regulations and ability to ensure product quality and safety; and
•   the ability to successfully integrate the east china business.
additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our u.s. stores and licensees. tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in some mbus may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the u.s. or other international markets. occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the u.s. due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations.
•   we face risks as a global business that could adversely affect our financial performance.
we operate in over 80 markets globally. our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as:
•   foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, or requirements to transact in specific currencies;
•   changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions in our markets, as well as negative effects on u.s. businesses due to increasing anti-american sentiment in certain markets;
•   interpretation and application of laws and regulations, including tax, tariffs, labor, merchandise, anti-bribery and privacy laws and regulations;
•   uncertainties and effects of the implementation of the united kingdom's referendum to withdraw membership from the european union (referred to as "brexit"), including financial, legal, tax and trade implications;
•   restrictive actions of foreign or u.s. governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, especially during periods of heightened tension between the u.s. and such foreign governmental authorities, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government intervention favoring local competitors, and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership;
•   import or other business licensing requirements;
•   the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;
•   limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new u.s. and international regulations;
•   in developing economies, the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast;
•   difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics, including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service, due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics, distance, language and cultural differences, as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining high quality employees in local markets;
•   local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees; and
•   delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings per share.
moreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries, which are important to our long-term growth prospects.
•   increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
the availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. we purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. the high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the "c" price. this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. increases in the "c" coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base "c" coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established.
the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather (including the potential effects of climate change), natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions, and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. in addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.
we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. additionally, and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy, other commodities, including but not limited to tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs and energy, as well as the processing of these inputs, are important to our operations. increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.
•   our financial condition and results of operations are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control.
our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control. any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations:
•   increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets;
•   adverse outcomes of litigation;
•   severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters affecting a large market or several closely located markets that may temporarily but significantly affect our retail business in such markets;
•   especially in our large markets, labor discord or disruption, geopolitical events, war, terrorism (including incidents targeting us), political instability, acts of public violence, boycotts, increasing anti-american sentiment in certain markets, social unrest, and health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores; and
•   the discontinuation of the london interbank offered rate ("libor") after 2021 and the replacement with an alternative reference rate may adversely impact interest rates.
•   interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability.
any material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants, interruptions in service by our third party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability.
additionally, our food, beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. we rely on these suppliers to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws. our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge as we increase our fresh and prepared food offerings, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the u.s. and from countries or regions with diminished infrastructure, developing or failing economies or which are experiencing political instability or social unrest. for certain products, we may rely on one or very few suppliers. a supplier's failure to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner, or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control. these issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability.
•   failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
failure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to operating margins, earnings per share, comparable store sales growth, operating cash flows, shareholder returns and net revenues, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. in addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance.
•   the loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial results.
much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel. the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business. our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees on whom we rely to give customers a superior in-store experience and elevate our brand. accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality management personnel and other employees to work in and manage our stores, both domestically and internationally. our ability to attract and retain both corporate and retail personnel is also acutely impacted in certain international and domestic markets where the competition for a relatively small number of qualified employees is intense or in markets where large high-tech companies are able to offer more competitive salaries and benefits. additionally, there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with customers. if we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.
•   failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results.
our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the sec, nasdaq, and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, food and beverage, sanitation, safety, environmental, labeling, anti-bribery and corruption and merchandise laws. changes in applicable environmental regulations, including increased or additional regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, incremental investments, and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability.
in addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving u.s. and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection, and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters. the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area. current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations (including the gdpr and the ccpa, discussed in more detail in this risk factors section, and other applicable international and u.s. privacy laws), or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies or result in the possibility of fines, litigation or orders, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. the burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business.
in addition, the european commission in july 2016 and the swiss government in january 2017 approved the eu-u.s. and the swiss-u.s. privacy shield frameworks, respectively, which are designed to allow u.s. companies that self-certify to the u.s. department of commerce and publicly commit to comply with the privacy shield requirements to freely import personal data from the eu and switzerland. however, these frameworks face a number of legal challenges and their validity remains subject to legal, regulatory and political developments in both europe and the u.s. the eu-u.s. privacy shield framework approved by the european commission which is relied upon for transfers of personal data outside the european economic area could be invalidated by the court of justice of the european union. the potential invalidation of this mechanism could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the european economic area.
the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels, and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. in addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.

overview starbucks results for fiscal 2019 reflect the impacts of continued streamlining efforts, initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, to focus on accelerating growth in high-returning businesses and converting several market operations, including thailand, france, and the netherlands, to fully licensed models in fiscal 2019. additionally, in fiscal 2019, we saw the full impact from the licensing of the majority of our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we realigned our operating segment reporting structure to better reflect the cumulative effect of our streamlining efforts. specifically, our previous china/asia pacific ("cap") segment and europe, middle east, and africa ("emea") segment have been combined into one international segment. results of siren retail, a non-reportable operating segment consisting of starbucks reservetm roastery & tasting rooms, certain stores under the starbucks reserve brand and princi operations, which were previously included within corporate and other, are now reported within the americas and international segments based on the geographical location of the operations. as a result, we have three reportable operating segments: americas, international and channel development. non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within corporate and other.
further, to better support the review of our results, we have changed the classification of certain costs. the most significant change was the reclassification of company-owned store occupancy costs from cost of sales to store operating expenses. we also made certain other immaterial changes.
concurrent with the change in reportable segments and realignment of certain operating expenses noted above, we revised our prior period financial information to be consistent with the current period presentation. there was no impact on consolidated net revenues, total operating expenses, operating income, or net earnings per share as a result of these changes.
in december 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation into law h.r. 1, commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"), which significantly changed existing u.s. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business. our u.s. corporate income tax rate for fiscal 2019 and future years is 21%, while a blended rate of 24.5% was applied in fiscal 2018.
financial highlights
•   total net revenues increased 7% to $26.5 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $24.7 billion in fiscal 2018.
•   consolidated operating income increased to $4.1 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to operating income of $3.9 billion in fiscal 2018. fiscal 2019 operating margin was 15.4% compared to 15.7% in fiscal 2018. operating margin compression in fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by partner (employee) investments and growth in wages and benefits, licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé and other strategic investments. these decreases were partially offset by sales leverage, cost savings initiatives, lower restructuring and impairment costs and the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage.
•   earnings per share ("eps") for fiscal 2019 decreased to $2.92, compared to eps of $3.24 in fiscal 2018. the decrease was primarily driven by lapping the prior year gains from the acquisition of our east china joint venture and the sale of our tazo brand, partially offset by the gain from the sale of our thailand retail operations during fiscal 2019.
•   capital expenditures were $1.8 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2018.
•   we returned $12.0 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2019 through share repurchases and dividends compared to $8.9 billion in fiscal 2018.

total net revenues          $26,508.6          $24,719.5              7.2     %
total net revenues increased $1.8 billion, or 7%, over fiscal 2018, primarily driven by higher revenues from company-operated stores ($1.9 billion). the growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 947 net new starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($957 million) and a 5% increase in comparable store sales ($879 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in comparable transactions. these increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($189 million) and the conversion of our thailand, france, and the netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets during fiscal 2019 ($161 million).
licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenues ($223 million), primarily due to higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($228 million), largely due to the opening of 992 net new starbucks® licensed stores over the past 12 months, and the conversion of our thailand, france, and the netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets ($35 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($41 million).
other revenues decreased $288 million, primarily driven by the licensing of our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé. partially offsetting this decrease was growth in product revenue, primarily premium single-serve products, in connection with the global coffee alliance.

cost of sales as a percentage of total net revenues increased 10 basis points, primarily due to licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé (approximately 80 basis points), partially offset by cost savings initiatives (approximately 70 basis points) and leverage on cost of sales, largely driven by price increases.
store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 130 basis points. store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 60 basis points, primarily driven by investments in our store partners that are funded by savings from the tax act and growth in wages and benefits (approximately 120 basis points), largely in the americas segment, partially offset by sales leverage driven by price increases and the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage.
other operating expenses decreased $184 million, primarily due to cost savings related to licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé ($176 million) and lapping prior year costs associated with the establishment of the global coffee alliance ($34 million), including business taxes associated with the up-front prepaid royalty from nestlé and headcount-related costs, primarily relating to employee bonus and retention costs.
depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in east china (approximately 20 basis points).
general and administrative expenses increased $116 million, primarily driven by higher performance-based compensation ($89 million) and the 2019 starbucks leadership experience in chicago, heavily concentrated in our fiscal fourth quarter ($52 million).
restructuring and impairment expenses decreased $89 million, primarily due to lower restructuring and impairment costs related to teavanatm/mc retail store closures ($128 million) and lower impairments related to our switzerland retail market ($27 million), partially offset by higher exit costs associated with the closure of certain starbucks® company-operated stores ($32 million) and severance costs ($25 million).
income from equity investees decreased $3 million, primarily due to the impact of our ownership changes in east china. this decrease was partially offset by improved comparable store sales from our joint venture in south korea and higher income from our north american coffee partnership joint venture.
the combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 30 basis points in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018.

gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture in fiscal 2018 was due to remeasuring our preexisting 50% ownership interest in our east china joint venture to fair value upon acquisition.
net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations was primarily due to the sale of our thailand, france and the netherlands retail operations in fiscal 2019. the gain in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the sale of our tazo brand and taiwan joint venture, partially offset by the net loss from the sale of our brazil retail operations in fiscal 2018.
interest income and other, net decreased $95 million, primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance on a prospective basis, which required estimated breakage on unredeemed store value cards to be recorded as revenue. we recorded store value card breakage in interest income and other, net in the prior year.
interest expense increased $161 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in november 2017, march 2018, august 2018 and may 2019.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 19.5% compared to 21.8% for fiscal 2018. the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the lower corporate tax rate as a result of the tax act (approximately 350 basis points), lapping prior year's transition tax on our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings and remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities (approximately 300 basis points), higher stock-based compensation excess tax benefit (approximately 140 basis points), the release of income tax reserves related to the settlement of a u.s. tax examination and the expiration of statute of limitations (approximately 130 basis points) and the tax impacts of the gain on the sale of our thailand retail operations (approximately 130 basis points). these favorable impacts were partially offset by the lapping of prior year's gain on the purchase of our east china joint venture that was not subject to income tax (approximately 580 basis points) and the impact of changes in indefinite reinvestment assertions for certain foreign subsidiaries during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (approximately 170 basis points). see note 13, income taxes, for further discussion.

revenues americas total net revenues for fiscal 2019 increased $1.5 billion, or 9%, primarily driven by a 5% increase in comparable store sales ($744 million) and 282 net new starbucks® company-operated stores, or a 3% increase, over the past 12 months ($580 million). also contributing were higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($144 million), primarily resulting from comparable store sales growth and the opening of 323 net new starbucks® licensed stores, or 4% increase, over the past 12 months and the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage ($119 million).
operating margin americas operating income for fiscal 2019 increased 9% to $3.8 billion, compared to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2018. operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 20.7%, primarily driven by higher partner investments, largely funded by savings from the tax act, growth in wages and benefits (approximately 130 basis points) and to a much lesser extent, investments in labor hours heavily concentrated in our fiscal fourth quarter. partially offsetting these were cost savings initiatives, primarily in cost of sales (approximately 90 basis points), the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage (approximately 50 basis points) and sales leverage.

discussion of our international segment results below reflects the impact of fully consolidating our east china business from an equity method joint venture to a company-operated market since the acquisition date of december 31, 2017. under the joint venture model, we recognized royalties and product sales within revenue and related product cost of sales as well as our proportionate share of east china's net earnings, which resulted in a higher margin business. under the company-operated ownership model, east china's operating results are reflected in most income statement lines of this segment.
revenues international total net revenues for fiscal 2019 increased $640 million, or 12%, primarily driven by 665 net new starbucks® company-operated stores, or a 12% increase, over the past 12 months ($377 million), the ownership change in east china ($280 million) and a 3% increase in comparable store sales ($135 million). also contributing were increased product sales to and royalty revenues from licensees ($84 million), primarily resulting from opening of 669 net new starbucks® licensed stores, or an 11% increase, over the past 12 months and the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage ($20 million). these increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($183 million) and the conversion of our thailand, france, and the netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets ($126 million).
operating margin international operating income for fiscal 2019 increased 11% to $965 million, compared to $873 million in fiscal 2018. operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 15.6%, primarily driven by strategic investments to support growth in china (approximately 80 basis points) and growth in wages and benefits (approximately 70 basis points), primarily offset by cost savings initiatives (approximately 80 basis points) and labor efficiencies (approximately 70 basis points).

our channel development segment results reflect the impact of the licensing of our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, which we lapped late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. our collaborative business relationships for our global ready-to-drink products and the associated revenues remain unchanged due to the global coffee alliance.
revenues channel development net revenues for fiscal 2019 decreased $305 million, or 13%, when compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé ($329 million), offset by growth in product revenue, primarily premium single-serve products, in connection with our global coffee alliance ($25 million).
operating margin channel development operating income for fiscal 2019 decreased 25% to $698 million, compared to $927 million in fiscal 2018. operating margin decreased 540 basis points to 35.0%, primarily driven by licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé (approximately 640 basis points), partially offset by lapping prior year costs associated with the establishment of the global coffee alliance (approximately 140 basis points), including business taxes associated with the up-front prepaid royalty and headcount-related costs, primarily related to employee bonus and retention costs.

total net revenues increased $2.3 billion, or 10%, over fiscal 2017, primarily driven by increased revenues from company-operated stores ($2.0 billion). the growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 816 net new starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($904 million), incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership change in east china ($903 million) and a 2% increase in comparable store sales ($345 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket.
licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenues ($297 million), primarily due to increased product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($298 million), largely due to the opening of 1,181 net new starbucks® licensed stores over the past 12 months and the conversions of both the singapore and taiwan markets to fully licensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and the first quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively ($44 million). these increases were partially offset by the impact of our ownership change in east china at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($53 million).
other revenues decreased $4 million, primarily driven by the absence of revenue due to the sale of our tazo brand in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($56 million), the closure of our e-commerce business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 ($51 million) and licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 ($50 million). partially offsetting these decreases were increased sales of packaged coffee and premium single-serve products ($115 million).

depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in east china (approximately 60 basis points).
general and administrative expenses increased $300 million, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations and the 2018 u.s. stock award granted in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, which was funded by savings from the tax act and vests over one year.
restructuring and impairment expenses increased $71 million, primarily due to higher asset impairments associated with the decision to close certain company-operated stores in the u.s. and canada ($23 million), higher goodwill impairment charges associated with our switzerland company-operated retail reporting unit ($20 million) and international restructuring costs, including severance and asset impairments ($18 million).
income from equity investees decreased $90 million, primarily due to the impact of ownership changes in our east china and taiwan joint ventures, partially offset by higher south korea joint venture income.
the combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 280 basis points in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.

gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture was due to remeasuring our preexisting 50% ownership interest in our east china joint venture to fair value upon acquisition.
net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations primarily consisted of sales of our tazo brand and taiwan joint venture, partially offset by the net loss from the sale of our brazil retail operations in fiscal 2018. the gain in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the sale of our singapore retail operations.
interest income and other, net increased $10 million, primarily due to recognizing higher income on unredeemed stored value card balances, partially offset by the lapping of prior year's gain on the sale of our investment in square, inc. warrants in the prior year period.
interest expense increased $78 million primarily related to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in november 2017, march 2018 and august 2018.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 21.8% compared to 33.2% for fiscal 2017. the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the gain on the purchase of our east china joint venture that was not subject to income tax (approximately 580 basis points) and the tax act (approximately 480 basis points). the impact from the tax act primarily included favorability from the lower corporate income tax rate applied to our fiscal 2018 results (approximately 760 basis points) and the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities (approximately 130 basis points). this favorability was partially offset by the estimated transition tax on our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings (approximately 400 basis points). see note 13, income taxes, for further discussion.

revenues americas total net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased $1.1 billion, or 7%, primarily driven by 383 net new starbucks® company-operated store openings, or a 4.1% increase, over the past 12 months ($604 million) and a 2% increase in comparable store sales ($319 million). also contributing were higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($173 million), primarily resulting from the opening of 512 net new starbucks® licensed stores, or a 7.2% increase, over the past 12 months.
operating income americas operating income for fiscal 2018 decreased 3% to $3.5 billion, compared to $3.6 billion in fiscal 2017. operating margin decreased 210 basis points to 20.8%, primarily due to food and beverage-related mix shifts (approximately 130 basis points), increased partner investments (approximately 120 basis points) which included incremental investments funded by the tax act, increased strategic investments (approximately 30 basis points), the impact of the may 29th anti-bias training (approximately 20 basis points) and higher restructuring costs, including asset impairments and severance (approximately 20 basis points), partially offset by sales leverage.

discussion of our international segment results below reflects the impact of fully consolidating our east china business from an equity method joint venture to a company-operated market since the acquisition date of december 31, 2017. under the joint venture model, we recognized royalties and product sales within revenue and related product cost of sales as well as our proportionate share of east china's net earnings, which resulted in a higher margin business. under a company-operated ownership model, east china's operating results are reflected in most line items on the statements of earnings.
revenues international total net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased $1.3 billion, or 32%, primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in east china ($850 million), 433 net new starbucks® company-operated store openings, or a 12.1% increase, over the past 12 months ($298 million), and favorable foreign currency translation ($121 million). also contributing were higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($100 million), primarily resulting from the opening of 669 net new starbucks licensed stores, or a 13.6% increase, over the past 12 months and the conversion of our taiwan joint venture to fully licensed operations at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($25 million).
operating margin international operating income for fiscal 2018 increased 4% to $872.8 million, compared to $835.6 million in fiscal 2017. operating margin decreased 420 basis points to 15.7%, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in east china (approximately 350 basis points). also contributing were higher goodwill impairment charges associated with our switzerland retail reporting unit (approximately 40 basis points) and restructuring costs, including severance and asset impairments (approximately 40 basis points).

discussion of our channel development segment results reflects the impact of the licensing of our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé and the sale of the tazo brand. late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we licensed our cpg (starbucks-, starbucks reserve-, teavana-, seattle's best coffee-, starbucks via- and torrefazione italia-branded packaged coffee and tea) and foodservice businesses to nestlé and formed the global coffee alliance. eleven months of fiscal 2018 results reflect our cpg and foodservice businesses as company-owned and one month as licensed operations. our collaborative business relationships for our global ready-to-drink products and the associated revenues remain unchanged due to the global coffee alliance.
revenues channel development net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased $41 million, or 2%, over fiscal 2017. revenue growth was driven by an increase in sales of our packaged coffee and premium single-serve products ($115 million), lapping a prior year revenue deduction adjustment ($13 million) and favorable foreign currency translation ($10 million). these increases were partially offset by the absence of revenue from the sale of our tazo brand in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($56 million) and licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 ($50 million).
operating margin channel development operating income for fiscal 2018 decreased 4% to $927.1 million, compared to $967.0 million in fiscal 2017. operating margin decreased 250 basis points to 40.4%, primarily driven by business taxes associated with the up-front payment received from nestlé (approximately 120 basis points), global coffee alliance headcount-related costs, including employee bonus and retention costs (approximately 80 basis points), and the impact of our ownership changes, including licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé and the sale of our tazo brand.

corporate and other primarily consists of our unallocated corporate expenses, as well as evolution fresh and the legacy operations of the teavana retail business, which substantially ceased during fiscal 2018. unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources cash and investment overview our cash and investments were $3.0 billion and $9.2 billion as of september 29, 2019 and september 30, 2018, respectively, with the decrease driven by the usage of the up-front prepaid royalty associated with the global coffee alliance primarily for share repurchases. we actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and corporate debt securities. as of september 29, 2019, approximately $1.7 billion of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries.
borrowing capacity our $2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the "2018 credit facility") and our $1.0 billion unsecured 364-day credit facility (the "364-day credit facility") are available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases.
the 2018 credit facility, of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on october 25, 2022. we have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on libor, and, for u.s. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a base rate (as defined in the credit facility) in each case plus an applicable margin. the applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the company's long-term credit ratings assigned by moody's and standard & poor's rating agencies and (ii) the company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the five-year credit agreement. the current applicable margin is 0.910% for eurocurrency rate loans and 0.000% (nil) for base rate loans.
the 364-day credit facility, of which no amount may be used for issuances of letters of credit, was set to mature on october 23, 2019. in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the maturity has been extended to october 21, 2020. we have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on libor, and, for u.s. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a base rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. the applicable margin is 0.920% for eurocurrency rate loans and 0.000% (nil) for base rate loans.
both credit facilities contain provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. as of september 29, 2019, we were in compliance with all applicable credit facility covenants. no amounts were outstanding under our credit facility as of september 29, 2019.
under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facilities discussed above. the proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. as of september 29, 2019, we had no borrowings under our commercial paper program.
in may 2019, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $1.0 billion of 10-year 3.550% senior notes (the "2029 notes") due august 2029 and $1.0 billion of 30-year 4.450% senior notes (the "2049 notes") due august 2049. interest on the 2029 notes and the 2049 notes is payable semi-annually on february 15 and august 15, commencing on august 15, 2019.
in august 2018, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $1.25 billion of 7-year 3.800% senior notes (the "2025 notes") due august 2025, $750 million of 10-year 4.000% senior notes (the "2028 notes") due november 2028 and $1 billion of 30-year 4.500% senior notes (the "2048 notes") due november 2048. interest on the 2025 notes is payable semi-annually on february 15 and august 15, commencing on february 15, 2019. interest on the 2028 and 2048 notes is payable semi-annually on may 15 and november 15, commencing on november 15, 2018.
in february 2018, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $1.0 billion of 5-year 3.100% senior notes (the "2023 notes") due march 2023 and $600 million of 10-year 3.500% senior notes (the "2028 notes") due march 2028. interest on the 2023 and 2028 notes is payable semi-annually on march 1 and september 1, commencing on september 1, 2018.
in november 2017, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of 3-year 2.200% senior notes (the "2020 notes") due november 2020 and $500 million of 30-year 3.750% senior notes (the "2047 notes") due december 2047. interest on the 2020 notes is payable semi-annually on may 22 and november 22, commencing on may 22, 2018 and interest on the 2047 notes is payable semi-annually on june 1 and december 1, commencing on june 1, 2018.
we will use the net proceeds from the offering of the 2049 notes to enhance our sustainability programs. we will use the net proceeds from these remaining offerings for general corporate purposes, including the repurchases of our common stock under our ongoing share repurchase program, business expansion and payment of dividends.
see note 9, debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for details of the components of our long-term debt.
the indentures under which all of our senior notes were issued require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. as of september 29, 2019, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.
use of cash we expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt, to invest in our core businesses, including capital expenditures, new product innovations, related marketing support and partner and digital investments, return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core and other developing businesses. further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda. acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy.
we believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as any shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. we have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. in this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
we regularly review our cash positions and our determination of indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. in the event we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and u.s. state income taxes, which could be material. we have revised our indefinite reinvestment assertions for prior years' cumulative earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. this change did not have a material impact to our financial results. we have not, nor do we anticipate the need for, repatriated funds to the u.s. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs. see note 13, income taxes, for further discussion.
during each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2018, we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.30 per share. in the last two quarters of fiscal 2018 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2019, we declared a cash dividend of $0.36 per share. dividends are paid in the quarter following the declaration date. cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2019 and 2018 totaled $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we declared a cash dividend of $0.41 per share to be paid on november 29, 2019 with an expected payout of approximately $486 million.
we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements ("asr agreements") with third-party financial institutions totaling $5.0 billion, effective october 1, 2018. we made a $5.0 billion up-front payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 72.0 million shares of our common stock. in march 2019, we received an additional 4.9 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volume-weighted average share price (less discount) of $65.03.
additionally, we entered into asr agreements with third-party financial institutions totaling $2.0 billion, effective march 22, 2019. we made a $2.0 billion up-front payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 22.2 million shares of our common stock. in june 2019, we received an additional 3.9 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volume-weighted average share price (less discount) of $76.50.
outside of the asr agreements noted above, during fiscal 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 36.6 million and 131.5 million shares of common stock, respectively, or $3.1 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, on the open market. for fiscal 2019, in connection with the asr agreements and other open market transactions, we repurchased 139.6 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $10.1 billion. in the first quarter 2019, we announced that our board of directors approved an increase of 120 million shares to our ongoing share repurchase program. as of september 29, 2019, 29.2 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations.
other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2020 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores and our supply chain and corporate facilities. total capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 are expected to be approximately $1.8 billion.
cash flows cash provided by operating activities was $5.0 billion for fiscal 2019, compared to $11.9 billion for fiscal 2018. the change was primarily driven by lapping the prior year receipt of the up-front payment from nestlé in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
cash used by investing activities totaled $1.0 billion for fiscal 2019, compared to $2.4 billion for fiscal 2018. the change was primarily driven by lapping the prior year payment to acquire the 50% ownership interest in our east china joint venture and higher proceeds from the divestiture of certain operations.
cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2019 totaled $10.1 billion, compared to $3.2 billion for fiscal 2018. the change was primarily due to lower proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and higher repurchases of our common stock under accelerated share repurchase agreements in fiscal 2019.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of september 29, 2019, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions):

(1)   we have excluded long-term gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties of $140.1 million from the amounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain.
(2)   amounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses.
(3)   purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on starbucks and that specify all significant terms. green coffee purchase commitments comprise 93% of total purchase obligations.
(4)   other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of the tax act transition tax, asset retirement obligations, valor siren ventures i l.p. (vsv) investment and hedging instruments.
starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business.
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k.
commodity prices, availability and general risk conditions commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. we purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. in addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. for additional details see product supply in item 1, as well as risk factors in item 1a of this 10-k.
financial risk management market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. we manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. the market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. excluding interest rate swaps, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. refer to note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, and note 3, derivative financial instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for further discussion of our hedging instruments.
the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.
commodity price risk we purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. we use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure.
the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 29, 2019 to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income ("oci") from changes in commodity prices. the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions):

foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in u.s. dollars. however, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the u.s., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the chinese renminbi, japanese yen, canadian dollar, british pound, south korean won and euro. to reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. see note 3, derivative financial instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for further discussion.
the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 29, 2019 to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the u.s. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates. the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions):

equity security price risk we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our marketable equity securities portfolio. marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our management deferred compensation plan ("mdcp"). gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our mdcp liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings.
we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of september 29, 2019 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.

interest rate risk long-term debt we utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. see note 3, derivative financial instruments and note 9, debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of september 29, 2019.
the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of september 29, 2019 on the fair value of starbucks debt (in millions):

(1)   amount disclosed is net of ($26 million) change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swap. refer to note 3, derivative financial instruments, for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge.
available-for-sale debt securities our available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. the primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments. we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of september 29, 2019 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.
application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k. we believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity.
we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. during the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise.
property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived assets we evaluate property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. when evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future undiscounted cash flows. if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life.
long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. for company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. the fair value of a store's assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. for other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses.
our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. for company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store's historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store's performance. the discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. these estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance.
during fiscal 2019, there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. however, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. when evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. if we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches.
when assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the size of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. if we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit's goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit's past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit's performance. the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. these estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion.
when assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. if we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. the fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group's forecasted growth, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. these estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion.
the goodwill impairment charges are discussed in note 8, other intangible assets and goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of operations. in projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss).
in addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. as discussed in note 13, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities.
we have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and u.s. state income taxes. we have revised our indefinite reinvestment assertions for prior years' cumulative earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. we regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. while we do not expect to repatriate cash to the u.s. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the u.s., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and u.s. state income taxes, which could be material.
our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.

item 1a.  risk factors in an enterprise as diverse as ours, a wide range of factors could affect future performance. we discuss in this section some of the risk factors that, if they actually occurred, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, value and results of operations. you should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements.
the significant risk factors affecting our operations include the following:
changes in united states or international economic conditions, including declines in the industries we serve, could adversely affect the profitability of any of our operations.
in 2019, approximately 35 percent of our revenue was generated in the united states, while approximately 65 percent was generated outside the united states. a general slowdown in the global economy or in a particular region or industry or an increase in trade tensions with u.s. trading partners could negatively impact our business, financial condition or liquidity. our largest markets include consumer non-durable, industrial, medical, electronics, consumer durable and automotive. a slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability.
a portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets, such as the electronics, polymer processing and metal finishing industries, which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions. the demand for our products depends, in part, on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers. downward economic cycles in our customers' industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products. it is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future.
any significant downturn in the health of the general economy, globally, regionally or in the markets in which we sell products, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance, resulting in impairment of assets. we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown, instability or recovery, generally or within any particular region or industry in which we operate.

if we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products, or our customers do not accept the new or enhanced products we develop, our revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted.
innovation is critical to our success. we believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a leading provider of precision technology solutions. we also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position. difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new or enhanced products or failure to gain market acceptance of new or enhanced products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position. we continue to invest in the development and marketing of new or enhanced products. there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. if we fail to make innovations, launch products with quality problems or the market does not accept our new products, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected. in addition, as new or enhanced products are introduced, we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers' ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that we can deliver sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers' demands.
increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services.
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience cyber-attacks to our systems and networks. to date, we have not experienced any material breaches or material losses related to cyber-attacks. to conduct our business, we rely extensively on information technology systems, networks and services, some of which are managed, hosted and provided by third-party service providers. increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and those of our third-party service providers and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data.  depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, including but not limited to confidential information relating to customer or employee data, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.  a cyber-attack or other disruption may also result in financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data or losses in connection with any litigation that may result from a cyber-attack. our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs arising from such events.
we have taken steps and incurred costs to further strengthen the security of our computer systems and continue to assess, maintain and enhance the ongoing effectiveness of our information security systems.  while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats.  the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognizable until launched against a target. accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. it is therefore possible that in the future we may suffer a criminal attack, unauthorized parties may gain access to personal information in our possession and we may not be able to identify any such incident in a timely manner.
the interpretation and application of data protection laws, including federal, state and international laws, relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, security and transfer of personally identifiable data in the u.s., europe (including but not limited to the european union's general data protection regulation), and elsewhere, are uncertain and evolving. it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. in addition, as a result of existing or new data protection requirements, we incur and expect to continue to incur significant ongoing operating costs as part of our significant efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information. these efforts also may divert management and employee attention from other business and growth initiatives. a breach in information privacy could result in legal or reputational risks and could have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations.
our results have been and could continue to be impacted by uncertainty in u.s. trade policy, including uncertainty surrounding changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed by the u.s. or other governments.
our ability to conduct business can be significantly impacted by changes in tariffs, changes or repeals of trade agreements, including withdrawal from or material modifications to the north american free trade agreement, which the u.s. government has renegotiated into the "united states-mexico-canada agreement" with mexico and canada and has yet to ratify, or the imposition of other trade restrictions or retaliatory actions imposed by various governments. other effects of these changes, including impacts on the price of raw materials, responsive actions from governments and the opportunity for competitors to establish a presence in markets where we participate, could also have significant impacts on our results. we cannot predict what further action may be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the u.s. and other governments, and any further changes in u.s. or international trade policy could have an adverse impact on our business.

our growth strategy includes acquisitions, and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully.
our recent historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to continue to depend, in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world. we cannot assure we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, prevail against competing potential acquirers, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets. in addition, we cannot assure that any acquisition, once successfully integrated, will perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow.
the success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties, including:
•   our ability to realize operating efficiencies, synergies or other benefits expected from an acquisition, and possible delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products;

•   diversion of management's time and attention from other business concerns;

•   difficulties in retaining key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired business;

•   difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies throughout acquired companies;

•   adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or customers;

•   the risks associated with the assumption of product liabilities, contingent or undisclosed liabilities of acquisition targets; and

•   the ability to generate future cash flows or the availability of financing.

in addition, an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the incurrence of acquisition-related debt, pre-acquisition potential tax liabilities, acquisition expenses, the amortization of acquisition-acquired assets, or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition.
we may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition, and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses. we could also incur significant costs, including, but not limited to, remediation costs, natural resources damages, civil or criminal fines and sanctions and third-party claims, as a result of past or future violations of, or liabilities, associated with environmental laws.
significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results.
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the euro, the yen, the pound sterling and the chinese yuan. any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the united states dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. for additional detail related to this risk, see item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk.
a significant portion of our consolidated revenues in 2019 were generated in currencies other than the united states dollar, which is our reporting currency. we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred. as a result, currency fluctuations between the united states dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses, which historically have been material and could continue to be material. we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates. we take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure, such as entering into hedging transactions, where available, but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. for example, uncertainty surrounding the effects and timing of brexit have caused increased volatility in global currency exchange rates that have resulted in the strengthening of the united states dollar against the foreign currencies in which we conduct business.  future adverse consequences arising from brexit may include continued volatility in exchange rates.  any significant fluctuation in exchange rates may be harmful to our financial condition and results of operations. we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into united states dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls. currency devaluations diminish the united states dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and, if they occur or continue for significant periods, could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow.
nordson corporation 11
any impairment in the value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization.
our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. the goodwill results from our acquisitions and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired. we assess at least annually whether there has been any impairment in the value of our intangible assets. if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if market conditions for acquired businesses decline, if significant and prolonged negative industry or economic trends exist, if our stock price and market capitalization declines, or if future cash flow estimates decline, we could incur, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment. any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and equity book value, the effect of which could be material.
changes in united states and international tax law may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions. changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect our business, financial condition and profitability by increasing our tax liabilities. our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in our effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. the u.s. federal government may adopt changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations. while we cannot predict what changes will actually occur with respect to any of these items, such changes could affect our business and results of operations.
if our intellectual property protection is inadequate, others may be able to use our technologies and tradenames and thereby reduce our ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and results of operations.
we regard much of the technology underlying our products and the trademarks under which we market our products as proprietary. the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or third parties may independently develop similar technology. we rely on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. the agreements may be breached or terminated, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and existing trade secrets, patent and copyright law afford us limited protection. policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization. litigation may be necessary for us to defend against claims of infringement or to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts. further, we might not prevail in such litigation, which could harm our business.
our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others, which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and, if we are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products.
third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims, and we may have to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages, if it is ultimately determined our products infringe. we may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party's intellectual property. we might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license, which, if available at all, may require us to pay substantial royalties. even if infringement claims against us are without merit, defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns.
we may be exposed to liabilities under the foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa), which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including the fcpa and similar worldwide anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other improper payments to private or public parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage. the fcpa also requires proper record keeping and characterization of such payments in our reports filed with the sec. our employees are trained and required to comply with these laws, and we are committed to legal compliance and corporate ethics. violations of these laws could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and financial penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.

our inability to comply with our existing credit facilities' restrictive covenants or to access additional sources of capital could impede growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness.
the limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities.
our existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:
•   borrow money or guarantee the debts of others;

•   use assets as security in other transactions;

•   make restricted payments or distributions; and

•   sell or acquire assets or merge with or into other companies.

in addition, our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios, including a "leverage ratio" and an "interest coverage ratio," both as defined in the credit facilities.
these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities.
our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance. if we fail to comply with such covenants and terms, we may be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable. we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities, including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants. if we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated, we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates.
we may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness. if we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions, we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing credit facilities. our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. we may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt. in addition, depending on market conditions and our financial performance, neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all. finally, as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions, our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed credit if they become undercapitalized.
changes in interest rates could adversely affect us.
any period of interest rate increases may adversely affect our profitability. at october 31, 2019, we had $1,244,142 of total debt and notes payable outstanding, of which 51 percent was priced at interest rates that float with the market. a one percentage point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in 2019 would have resulted in approximately $7,236 of additional interest expense. a higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates. for additional detail related to this risk, see item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk. additionally, the interest rates on some of our debt is tied to libor. in july 2017, the head of the united kingdom's financial conduct authority announced its intention to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021.  the uncertainty regarding the future of libor, as well as the transition from libor to another benchmark rate or rates could have adverse impacts on our outstanding debt and notes payable that currently use libor as a benchmark rate, and ultimately, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
failure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully.
during 2019, we experienced a leadership change with the appointment of a new president and chief executive officer. our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive management team and the ability to recruit, hire and retain other key management personnel to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace executives who retire or resign. failure to retain our leadership team and attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our global growth and operational initiatives, possibly resulting in inefficient and ineffective management and operations, which would likely harm our revenues, operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability.
nordson corporation 13
the level of returns on pension plan assets and changes in the actuarial assumptions used could adversely affect us.
our operating results may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. u.s. gaap requires that we calculate pension expense using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates for future payment obligations, and the expected rate of increase in future compensation levels. our pension expense and funding requirements may also be affected by our actual return on plan assets and by legislation and other government regulatory actions. changes in assumptions, laws or regulations could lead to variability in operating results and could have a material adverse impact on liquidity.
political conditions in the u.s. and foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us.
we conduct our manufacturing, sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the united states. in 2019, approximately 65 percent of our total sales were generated outside the united states. we expect that international operations and united states export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future. both sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states. such risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
•   risks of political or economic instability, such as brexit;

•   unanticipated or unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;

•   threats of war, terrorism or governmental instability;

•   changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or other additional tax policies, and other proposals to reform united states and foreign tax laws that impact how united states multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings;

•   restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country;

•   potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;

•   the disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances;

•   the imposition of tariffs, import or export licensing requirements and other potential changes in trade policies and relations arising from policy initiatives implemented by the current u.s. presidential administration; and

•   exchange controls or other trade restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country.

any of these events could reduce the demand for our products, limit the prices at which we can sell our products, interrupt our supply chain, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance.
our international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the u.s. and those foreign countries in which our customers, subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations. a protectionist trade environment in either the u.s. or those foreign countries in which we do business, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance or other trade policies, may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets. the current u.s. presidential administration has criticized existing trade agreements, and while it remains unclear what actions the administration may take with respect to existing and proposed trade agreements, or restrictions on trade generally, more stringent export and import controls may be ultimately imposed in the future.
our business and operating results may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control.
while we have taken precautions to prevent production and service interruptions at our global facilities, severe weather conditions such as hurricanes or tornadoes, as well as major earthquakes, wildfires and other natural disasters, as well as cyberterrorism, in areas in which we have manufacturing facilities or from which we obtain products may cause physical damage to our properties, closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities, lack of an adequate work force in a market, temporary disruption in the supply of inventory, disruption in the transport of products and utilities, and delays in the delivery of products to our customers. any of these factors may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
nordson corporation 14
the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures.
we maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. we are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail. additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers. in the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations note regarding amounts and fiscal year references in this annual report, all amounts related to united states dollars and foreign currency and to the number of nordson corporation's common shares, except for per share earnings and dividend amounts, are expressed in thousands. unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to "we," "us," "our," or the "company" mean nordson corporation.
unless otherwise noted, all references to years relate to our fiscal year ending october 31.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements. we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management.
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. on a regular basis, critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors.
revenue recognition - a contract exists when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration is probable.  revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with a customer are satisfied. generally, our revenue results from short-term, fixed-price contracts and is recognized as of a point in time when the product is shipped or at a later point when the control of the product transfers to the customer. refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion around the company's revenue recognition policy.
business combinations - the acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition, with the remainder, if any, recorded as goodwill. the fair values are determined by management, taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities, and other relevant information. such information typically includes valuations obtained from independent appraisal experts, which management reviews and considers in its estimates of fair values. the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets, discounted to present value. the determination of fair values requires significant judgment by management, particularly with respect to the value of identifiable intangible assets. this judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets. the impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and/or depreciation expense.
goodwill - goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations. goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, or more often if indications of impairment exist. our reporting units are the adhesive dispensing systems segment, the industrial coating systems segment and one level below the advanced technology systems segment.
we test goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification (asc) 350. goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated in the quantitative analysis described below. we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2019. we use an independent valuation specialist to assist with refining our assumptions and methods used to determine fair values using these methods. to test for goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach.
the discounted cash flow method (income approach) uses assumptions for revenue growth, operating margin, and working capital turnover that are based on management's strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends. terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the gordon growth model method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital (wacc) methodology and growth rate. for each reporting unit, a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness for detecting impairment. discount rates are developed using a wacc methodology. the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors. for 2019, the discount rates used ranged from 9 percent to 12 percent depending upon the reporting unit's size, end market volatility, and projection risk.
nordson corporation 21
in the application of the guideline public company method (market approach), fair value is determined using transactional evidence for similar publicly traded equity. the comparable company guideline group is determined based on relative similarities to each reporting unit since exact correlations are not available. an indication of fair value for each reporting unit is based on the placement of each reporting unit within a range of multiples determined for its comparable guideline company group. valuation multiples are derived by dividing latest twelve-month performance for revenues and ebitda into total invested capital, which is the sum of traded equity plus interest bearing debt less cash. these multiples are applied against the revenue and ebitda of each reporting unit. while the implied indications of fair value using the guideline public company method yield meaningful results, the discounted cash flow method of the income approach includes management's thoughtful projections and insights as to what the reporting units will accomplish in the near future. accordingly, the reasonable, implied fair value of each reporting unit is a blend based on the consideration of both the income and market approaches.
in 2019, 2018, and 2017, the results of our annual impairment tests indicated no impairment.
the excess of fair value (fv) over carrying value (cv) was compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit. based on the results shown in the table below and based on our measurement date of august 1, 2019, our conclusion is that no goodwill was impaired in 2019. potential events or circumstances, such as a sustained downturn in global economies, could have a negative effect on estimated fair values.

pension plans and postretirement medical plans - the measurement of liabilities related to our pension plans and postretirement medical plans is based on management's assumptions related to future factors, including interest rates, return on pension plan assets, compensation increases, mortality and turnover assumptions, and health care cost trend rates.
the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 3.25 percent at october 31, 2019 and 4.53 percent at october 31, 2018. the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the present value of our various international pension plan obligations was 1.26 percent at october 31, 2019, compared to 2.14 percent at october 31, 2018. the discount rates used for all plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled.
in determining the expected return on plan assets, we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long-term rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans. we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions. the expected rate of return (long-term investment rate) on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 6.00 percent in both 2019 and 2018. the average expected rate of return on international pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 3.96 percent in 2019 and 3.91 percent in 2018.
the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 4.00 percent at october 31, 2019, compared to 3.90 percent at october 31, 2018. the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our international pension plan obligations was 3.12 percent at both october 31, 2019, and october 31, 2018.
annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year. differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years.

economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. the effect of a one percent change in the discount rate, expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below. bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts.

with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan, the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was 3.27 percent at october 31, 2019 and 4.56 percent at october 31, 2018. the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits (the health care cost trend rate) is assumed to be 3.62 percent in 2020, decreasing gradually to 3.24 percent in 2026.
for the international postretirement plan, the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was 3.03 percent at october 31, 2019 and 3.88 percent at october 31, 2018. the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits (the health care cost trend rate) is assumed to be 4.00 percent in 2020 to 4.05 percent in 2040.
the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. for example, a one-percentage point change in the discount rate and the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects. bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts.

income taxes - income taxes are estimated based on income for financial reporting purposes. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes in valuation allowances. we provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
nordson corporation 23
management believes the valuation allowances are adequate after considering future taxable income, allowable carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount (including the valuation allowance), an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. conversely, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be expensed in the period such determination was made.
further, at each interim reporting period, we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full year. significant judgment is involved regarding the application of global income tax laws and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix of income. additionally, interpretation of tax laws, court decisions or other guidance provided by taxing authorities influences our estimate of the effective income tax rates. as a result, our actual effective income tax rates and related income tax liabilities may differ materially from our estimated effective tax rates and related income tax liabilities. any resulting differences are recorded in the period they become known.

as of october 31, 2019, approximately 94 percent of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held at various foreign subsidiaries. deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that are intended to be permanently invested in those operations. these undistributed earnings represent the post-income tax earnings under u.s. gaap not adjusted for previously taxed income which aggregated approximately $1,101,736 and $1,088,183 at october 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. should these earnings be distributed, applicable foreign tax credits, distributions of previously taxed income, and utilization of other attributes would substantially offset taxes due upon the distribution. it is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on such undistributed earnings.

(1)   in april 2019, we amended, restated and extended the term of our existing $605,000 term loan facility with a group of banks. the unsecured term loan agreement provides for the following three tranches: $100,000 due in march 2020, $200,000 due in september 2022, and $305,000 due in march 2024. the weighted average interest rate for borrowings under this agreement was 2.52 percent at october 31, 2019. for the portion that is due in march 2024, $100,000 of this tranche was paid down in 2019. we were in compliance with all covenants at october 31, 2019.

in april 2019, we entered into a $850,000 unsecured, multicurrency credit facility with a group of banks, which amended, restated and extended our existing syndicated revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to expire in february 2020. this facility has a five-year term expiring april 2024, and includes a $75,000 subfacility for swing-line loans.  at october 31, 2019, we had no balances outstanding under this facility, compared to $52,200 outstanding at october 31, 2018. we were in compliance with all covenants at october 31, 2019, and the amount we could borrow under the facility would not have been limited by any debt covenants.
in october 2018, we entered into a €150,000 unsecured term loan agreement with bank of america merrill lynch international limited.  the interest rate is variable based on the eur libor rate.  the weighted average interest rate at october 31, 2019 was 1.00 percent.  the balance outstanding at october 31, 2019 and october 31, 2018 was €115,000 ($128,219) and €15,000 ($16,967), respectively.  we were in compliance with all covenants at october 31, 2019.
in june 2018, we entered into a note purchase agreement with a group of insurance companies under which we sold $350,000 of unsecured senior notes to the insurance companies and their affiliates. the notes mature in june 2023 through june 2030 and bear interest at fixed rates between 3.71 percent and 4.17 percent.  we used the proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay approximately $315,000 of the outstanding balance under our existing syndicated revolving credit facility at that time, and the remainder for general corporate purposes.  we were in compliance with all covenants at october 31, 2019.
we entered into a $150,000 three-year note purchase and private shelf agreement with new york life investment management llc in 2011.  in 2015, the amount of the facility was increased to $180,000, and in 2016 it was increased to $200,000. senior notes issued under the agreement can have a maturity of up to 12 years, with an average life of up to 10 years, and are unsecured. at october 31, 2019 and october 31, 2018, there was $30,556 and $36,111, respectively, outstanding under this facility. existing notes mature between january 2020 and september 2020.  the interest rate on each borrowing is fixed.  at october 31, 2019, the amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at fixed rates between 2.21 percent and 2.56 percent. we were in compliance with all covenants at october 31, 2019, and the amount we could borrow would not have been limited by any debt covenants.

(2)   refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

(3)   pension and postretirement plan funding amounts after 2020 will be determined based on the future funded status of the plans and therefore cannot be estimated at this time. refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

(4)   purchase obligations primarily represent commitments for materials used in our manufacturing processes that are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet.

we believe that the combination of present capital resources, cash from operations and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for 2020. there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company.
outlook our operating performance, balance sheet position, and financial ratios for 2019 remained strong, although uncertainties persist in global financial markets and the general economic environment.  going forward, we are well-positioned to manage our liquidity needs that arise from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and contributions related to pension and postretirement obligations as well as principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt.  primary sources of capital to meet these needs, as well as other opportunistic investments, are a combination of cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements.  in 2019, cash from operations was 17 percent of revenue.  with respect to borrowings, as of october 31, 2019, we had full available capacity under our five-year term, $850,000 unsecured, multicurrency credit facility.  this credit facility expires in february 2024.
respective to all of these loans are two primary covenants: the leverage ratio that generally restricts indebtedness (net of cash) to a maximum 3.75 times consolidated four-quarter trailing ebitda and the interest coverage ratio that requires four-quarter trailing ebitda to be a minimum of 2.5 times consolidated trailing four-quarter interest expense.  (debt, ebitda, and interest expense are as defined in the respective credit agreements.)
we are optimistic about our longer-term growth opportunities in the diverse consumer non-durable, industrial, medical, electronics, consumer durable and automotive end markets we serve. we also support our customers with parts and consumables, so a significant percentage of our revenue is recurring. for 2020, organic sales are expected to increase 1 to 3 percent compared to the prior year, offset by an unfavorable currency effect of less than 1 percent, based on the current exchange rate environment as compared to the prior year. based on this 2020 sales outlook, we are forecasting earnings per share growth of 2 percent to 6 percent compared to the prior year we move forward with caution given the potential for a lower-growth macroeconomic environment, continued trade negotiations and the marketplace effects of political instability in certain areas of the world.  though the status of the global economy remains unclear, our growth potential has been demonstrated over time through our ability to build and enhance our core businesses by entering emerging markets, pursuing market adjacencies and driving growth initiatives.  we drive value for our customers through our application expertise, differentiated technology, and direct sales and service support. our priorities also are focused on operational efficiencies by employing continuous improvement methodologies in our business processes.  we expect our efforts will continue to provide more than sufficient cash from operations to meet our liquidity needs, pay dividends to common shareholders and enable us to invest in the development of new applications and markets for our technologies.  we intend to focus capital expenditures in 2020 on continued investments in our information systems and projects that improve both the capacity and efficiency of manufacturing and distribution operations. cash from operations has been 16 to 22 percent of revenues over the past five years, which when combined with our available borrowing capacity and ready access to capital markets, is more than adequate to fund our liquidity needs over the next year.

with respect to contractual spending, the table above presents our financial obligations as $1,640,496, of which $338,809 is payable in 2020.  in december 2014, the board of directors authorized a $300,000 common share repurchase program.  in august 2015, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $200,000 of the company's common shares. in august 2018, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $500,000 of the company's common shares, bringing the aggregate total of common shares authorized for repurchase to $1,000,000. approximately $485,242 of the total $1,000,000 authorized remained available for share repurchases at october 31, 2019. the repurchase program is funded using cash from operations and proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities.  timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are contingent on a number of factors including the level of cash generated from operations, cash requirements for acquisitions, repayment of debt and our share price.
new accounting standards refer to note 2 for further discussion of recently issued accounting standards.
effects of foreign currency the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices, sales volume, product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate. as a general rule, a weakening of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income, while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect.
in 2019, as compared with 2018, the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies. if 2018 exchange rates had been in effect during 2019, sales would have been approximately $45,600 higher and third party costs would have been approximately $23,500 higher. in 2018, as compared with 2017, the united states dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies. if 2017 exchange rates had been in effect during 2018, sales would have been approximately $41,800 lower and third-party costs would have been approximately $21,700 higher. these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates.
inflation inflation affects profit margins as the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing. although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by the financial statements included in this report, we continue to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation through focused efforts to increase productivity.
trends the five-year summary in item 6 documents our historical financial trends. over this period, the world's economic conditions fluctuated significantly. our solid performance is attributed to our participation in diverse geographic and industrial markets and our long-term commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet our customers' changing needs.

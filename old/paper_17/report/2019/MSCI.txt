item 1a.   risk factors

you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. you should read the section titled "forward-looking statements" on page 1 for a description of the types of statements that are considered forward-looking statements, as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this annual report on form 10-k. this information should be read in conjunction with "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. the following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements.
operational risks we are dependent on third parties to supply data, applications and services for our products and services and are dependent on certain vendors to distribute our products. a refusal or failure by a key vendor to distribute our products or any loss of key outside suppliers of data, applications or services or a reduction in the accuracy or quality of such data, applications or services or any failure by us to comply with our suppliers' or distributors' licensing requirements could impair our ability to provide our clients with our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we rely on third-party suppliers of data, applications and services, including data from stock exchanges ("vendor products"), and depend on the accuracy and quality of vendor products and the ability and willingness of such suppliers to deliver, support, enhance and develop new vendor products on a timely and cost-effective basis, and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes in order to produce, deliver and develop our products and services.
if vendor products include errors, design defects, are delayed, become incompatible with future versions of our products, are unavailable on acceptable terms or are not available at all, we may not be able to deliver our products and services. some of our agreements with third party suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice and we have not completed formal agreements for all our vendor products, such as certain stock exchanges. from time to time we receive notices from third party suppliers, including stock exchanges, threatening to terminate the provision of their products or services to us, and some data suppliers, including at least one stock exchange, have terminated the provision of their data to us. termination of the provision of vendor products by one or more of our significant suppliers or exclusion from, or restricted use of, or litigation in connection with vendor products could decrease the data and materials available for us to use and deliver to our clients. in addition, some of our competitors could enter into exclusive contracts with our data suppliers, including with certain stock exchanges. if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data or other materials from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data or other materials, which would give our competitors a competitive advantage. such exclusive contracts could hinder our ability to create our products and services or to provide our clients with the data or other products or services they prefer, which could lead to a decrease in our client base.
despite our efforts to comply with the licensing requirements of vendor products, our use of certain vendor products has been challenged in the past and there can be no assurance that third parties may not challenge our use in the future, resulting in increased acquisition or licensing costs, loss of rights and/or costly legal actions. our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace the functionality provided by vendor products that becomes unavailable or fails to operate effectively for any reason. our operating costs could increase if additional license fees are imposed or current license fees increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to vendor products are substantial and we are unable to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent products or services. if any of these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
12
we also rely on certain third-party vendors to distribute our data to clients. while some of our vendors generate revenue in connection with distributing our data, others do not derive a direct financial benefit.  should any of our key vendors refuse to distribute our data for any reason or require that we pay them fees in connection with the distribution of our data, we would need to find alternative ways to distribute our data or lose revenue in connection with paying distribution fees, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
if we fail to attract or retain the necessary qualified personnel, including through our compensation programs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
the development, maintenance and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge, skills, experience and abilities of our employees. accordingly, we believe the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executives and other key employees. although we do not believe that we are overly dependent upon any individual employee, our management and other employees may terminate their employment at any time and the loss of any of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. if our compensation programs do not adequately engage our key employees or are not competitive, or if we fail to attract, engage and retain the necessary qualified personnel, the quality of our products and services as well as our ability to support and retain our clients and achieve business objectives may suffer.
if our products contain undetected errors or fail to perform properly due to defects, malfunctions or similar problems, we may, among other things, become subject to increased costs or liability based on the use of our products or services to support our clients' investment processes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
our products and services support the investment processes of our clients, which relate to, in the aggregate, trillions of dollars in assets. products we develop or license may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing. use of our products or services as part of the investment process creates the risk that our clients, the parties whose assets are managed by our clients or the companies that we rate or assess in our esg segment may pursue claims against us based on even a small error in our data, calculations, methodologies or analysis or a malfunction or failure in our systems, products or services.
errors or defects can exist at any point in a product's life cycle, but are frequently found after introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products. we continually introduce new methodologies and products, and new versions of and updates to our products. despite internal testing and in some cases testing or use by clients, our products may contain errors in our data, calculations, methodologies or analysis, including serious defects or malfunctions. if we detect any errors before we release or deliver a product or publish a methodology or analysis, we might have to suspend or delay the product release or delivery for an extended period of time while we address the problem. we may not discover errors that affect our products or enhancements until after they are deployed, and we may need to provide enhancements or corrections to address such errors, and in certain cases it may be impracticable to do so. if undetected errors exist in our products, or if our products fail to perform properly due to defects, malfunctions or similar problems, it could result in harm to our brand or reputation, significantly increased costs, lost sales, delays in commercial release, third party claims, contractual disputes, negative publicity, delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products, license terminations or renegotiations and/or unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy or mitigate such errors, defects or malfunctions. the realization of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
while we have provisions in our client contracts that are designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by our clients or third parties based on the use of our products or services or our delay or failure to provide services, these provisions could be invalidated or fail to eliminate liability resulting from the occurrence of any of these events, which could result in the provision of credits, contractual penalties and adverse monetary judgments. any such claims brought against us, even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us, would require attention of our management, personnel, financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation or pose a significant disruption to our normal business operations. in addition, the duration or outcome of such claims and lawsuits is difficult to predict, which could further exacerbate the adverse effect they may have on our business operations.
13
client risks our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets under management or total expense ratio of an index-linked investment product may seek to negotiate a lower asset-based fee percentage or lower the total expense ratio of such products or may cease using our indexes, which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from asset-based fees.
a portion of our revenues are from asset-based fees and these revenue streams are concentrated in some of our largest clients, including blackrock, and in our largest market, the u.s. our clients, including our largest clients, may seek for a variety of reasons to negotiate to pay us lower asset-based fee percentages, which are sometimes calculated as a percentage of the relevant product's total expense ratio ("ter"). additionally, competition is intense among our clients that offer or manage index-linked investment products, including etfs, and low fees are one of the competitive differentiators. where an investment product's ter determines our fees, a reduction in the ter may negatively impact our revenues.  additionally, our clients, including our largest clients, may seek to lower or eliminate floors on asset-based fees (i.e., minimum asset-based fee percentages) or impose or lower ceilings on asset-based fees (i.e., maximum asset-based fee percentages). such changes affecting our fees and fee structures could individually, or in the aggregate, negatively impact our revenues.
moreover, clients that have licensed our indexes to serve as the basis of index-linked investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indexes and could elect to cease offering the product or switch to a lower fee index.  for example, at least one large client ceased using msci indexes as the basis for a significant number of its index funds. clients that license our indexes to serve as the basis for listed futures and options contracts might also discontinue such contracts.  additionally, we have a differentiated licensing strategy for our indexes and from time to time experience faster growth from lower fee products, resulting in a lower average asset-based fee percentage from index-linked investment products. while we aim to maximize the price and volume trade-off over the long-term, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so.  results for any given quarter could be materially adversely affected by stronger growth in assets in index-linked investment products with lower than average fees not sufficiently offset by growth in assets in index-linked investment products with higher than average fees. our asset-based fees could dramatically decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. finally, to the extent that multiple investment products are based on the same index, (i) assets under management in one product could shift to products that pay msci lower fee levels, (ii) the products could compete for the same assets such that none of the products becomes large enough to be successful or sustained, or (iii) the failure or discontinuance of one product (e.g., derivatives used for hedging) could have a detrimental effect on the use of the other products (e.g., etfs).
cancellations or reductions by any of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
a material portion of our revenues is concentrated in some of our largest customers. for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019, our largest client organization by revenue, blackrock, accounted for 11.5% of our total revenues. for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018, blackrock, accounted for 11.9% of our total revenues. our revenue growth depends on our ability to obtain new clients and achieve and sustain a high level of renewal rates with respect to our existing licenses. failure to achieve one or more of these objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. if one or more of our largest clients cancels or reduces its licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those licenses, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
our clients may become more self-sufficient, which may reduce demand for our products or services and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
our clients may internally develop certain functionality contained in the products or services they currently license from us. for example, a number of our clients have obtained regulatory clearance to create indexes for use as the basis of etfs that they manage. for example, on september 20, 2016, blackrock received exemptive relief from the sec to create certain indexes for use as the basis of etfs that it would manage. similarly, some of our clients who currently license our risk data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk, making our products or services unnecessary for them. a growing number of asset managers and investment banks, in partnership with index providers that offer calculation agent services, or acting together with an industry group or association, have created or may create their own range of proprietary indexes, which they use to manage funds or as the basis of etfs, structured products or over-the-counter derivatives. to the extent that our clients become more self-sufficient, demand for our products or services may be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
14
technology risks any failures, disruptions, instability or vulnerabilities in our information technology architecture, platforms, production and delivery systems, software, code, internal network, the internet or other systems or applications may cause our products to be unavailable or fail and impose delays or additional costs in deploying our products, or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential and result in reputational and other harm and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we depend heavily on the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology systems and platforms and their components, including our data centers and production and delivery systems as well the internet, to create and deliver our products and service our clients. heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties, operational failures, human error, terrorist or other attacks affecting systems or sites where we are located, climate or weather related events (e.g., natural disasters), power loss, telecommunications failures, technical breakdowns, internet failures or computer viruses could impair our systems' operations or interrupt their availability for extended periods of time. our ability to effectively use the internet may also be impaired due to infrastructure failures, service outages at third-party internet providers or increased government regulation.
disruptions, failures or slowdowns that could occur with respect to our operations, including to our information technology systems and platforms, our electronic delivery systems or the internet, could damage our brand and reputation, result in litigation and negatively affect our ability to distribute our products effectively and to service our clients, including delivering managed services or delivering real-time index data.  there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully defend against such disruptions or that our disaster recovery or business continuity plans will be effective in mitigating the risks and associated costs, which could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of data could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
many of our products provide for the exchange of sensitive information with our clients through a variety of media, such as the internet, applications and dedicated transmission lines. we rely on a complex system of internal processes and software controls along with policies, procedures and training to protect data that we receive in the ordinary course of business, including sensitive and confidential client data such as material non-public information and client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems, against unauthorized data access or disclosure. in addition, we change the composition of our indexes from time to time and we believe that, in some cases, such changes can have an indirect effect on the prices of constituent securities and on certain index-linked investment products based on our indexes as a result of trading activity related to replicating our indexes.
if our internal processes, confidentiality policies, conflict of interest policies or information barrier procedures fail or are insufficient, including as a result of human error or manual processes, or if an employee purposely circumvents or violates our internal controls, policies or procedures, then unauthorized access to, or disclosure or misappropriation of, data, including material non-public or other confidential information (e.g., index composition data), our brand and reputation may suffer and we may become subject to litigation, regulatory actions, sanctions or other penalties, leading to a loss of client confidence, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
successful cyber-attacks and the failure of cyber-security systems and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
the company's operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of data and information, and on those of its third-party vendors. we and our vendors are subject to cyber risks, including cyber-attacks, such as phishing scams, hacking, tampering, intrusions, viruses, ransomware, malware and denial-of-service attacks. our and our vendors' use of mobile and cloud technologies may increase our risk for such threats. the company may be exposed to more targeted and more sophisticated cyber-attacks aimed at accessing certain information on our systems because of our prominence in the global marketplace, including client portfolio data, the composition of our indexes and msci esg research ratings of corporate issuers. any such threats may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or our vendors' products or services, networks, systems, websites, applications, data or data processing, or may otherwise compromise the availability, confidentiality or integrity of data or information in our possession.  while the company has not experienced cyber incidents that are individually, or in the aggregate, material, the company has experienced cyber-attacks of varying degrees in the past, including denial-of-service attacks, and there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future.
15
our security measures or those of our third-party providers, including any cloud-based technologies, may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed. cyber-attacks, security breaches or third-party reports of perceived security vulnerability to the company's systems, even if no breach has occurred, could damage our brand and reputation, result in litigation, regulatory actions, sanctions or other penalties, lead to loss of client confidence in our security measures and reliability, which would harm our ability to retain clients and gain new ones, and lead to financial losses. any of the foregoing could lead to unexpected or higher than estimated costs.  we may also incur additional costs as a result of increasing and refining our internal processes and software controls and policies and procedures related to security, processing integrity and confidentiality or privacy.
migration of our applications, systems, processes and infrastructure to new technologies, data centers, processes, platforms or applications could result in unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of our products which could impair our ability to provide clients with products and customer service.  such impairment may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
we have experienced unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain products after we migrated applications and infrastructure to new data centers. while we have taken steps to mitigate such interruptions and delays, we cannot provide assurance that they will not occur again in the future even after extensive testing of new systems, processes, applications and hardware. such disruptions may result in cancellations and reduced demand for our products and services, resulting in decreased revenues. after adopting new technologies, applications and processes, such as cloud computing, virtualization and agile software development, we may experience unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain of our products and services. we may also incur increased operating expenses to recover data, repair, replace or remediate systems, equipment or facilities, and to protect ourselves from such disruptions. accordingly, any significant failures, disruptions or instability affecting our information technology platform, data centers, production and delivery systems, applications, processes or the internet could negatively affect our ability to distribute our products effectively and to service our clients, damage our brand and reputation and result in litigation, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
our use of open source code could introduce security vulnerabilities into our internal network system, impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products, or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential.
we rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products, as well as to support our internal systems and infrastructure. the use of open source code may entail greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims, the quality of the code or the security of the code. some open source licenses provide that if we combine our proprietary applications with open source software in a certain manner, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary applications to the public. this would allow our competitors to create similar products with less development effort and time and ultimately put us at a competitive disadvantage. additionally, the terms of many open source code licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by u.s. courts. accordingly, there are risks that there may be a failure in our procedures for controlling the use of open source code or that these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. in either event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties on terms that are not commercially feasible, to make generally available portions of our proprietary code, to re-engineer our products or systems, to discontinue the licensing of our products if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely or cost-effective basis, or to take other remedial action that could divert resources away from our development efforts. any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
16
strategy and growth risks our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past for several reasons, including if our operating costs are higher than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we have experienced significant revenue and earnings growth since we began operations. there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past. if we experience higher than expected operating costs, including increased compensation costs, regulatory compliance costs, occupancy costs, selling and marketing costs, investments in geographic expansion, communication costs, travel costs, application development costs, professional fees, costs related to information technology infrastructure and other it costs, and we cannot adjust to these costs, our operating results may fluctuate significantly or our anticipated profitability may be reduced and our anticipated results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected.  additionally, there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our product development, marketing efforts, or capital return or allocation strategies as we have been in the past, or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past.
our business may be affected by changes in the global capital markets, including adverse equity market conditions, volatility in the financial markets and evolving investment trends. such changes could decrease the use of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
our business is impacted by economic conditions and volatility in the global capital markets. our clients use our products for a variety of investment objectives, including benchmarking and portfolio construction and esg, factor, private real estate and mac investing. volatile capital markets may impact whether investors choose to invest in developed or emerging markets, or in the u.s. or non-u.s. markets, as well as whether to adopt different investment styles.
our equity indexes serve as equity benchmarks against which our clients can measure the performance of their investments and are also used by clients as the basis for certain index-linked investment products for a fee based on the value of the investment product's assets. the value of an investment product's assets may increase or decrease in response to changes in market performance and cash inflows and outflows, which could impact our revenues. our analytics segment offers performance attribution and portfolio management content, applications and services and mac models that provide clients with an integrated view of risk and return of their portfolios across markets and asset classes. additionally, equity models developed in our analytics segment are used to construct msci factor indexes. our esg segment offers esg ratings and research on companies worldwide to provide clients with an understanding of how esg factors can impact the long-term risk of their investments.  such research is also used in the construction of equity and fixed income indexes, which help investors more effectively benchmark esg investment performance and manage and measure esg mandates.
additionally, an increasing portion of our revenues comes from products that relate to certain investment trends, such as esg, factor and mac investing.  a decline in the equity markets or a trend away from such investment trends could decrease demand for the company's related products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
competition and financial and budgetary pressures affecting clients in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. to remain competitive, we must successfully develop new and enhanced products and services and effectively manage product transitions and integrations.
competition exists across all markets for our products and services. our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small, single-product businesses that are highly specialized. our larger competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale, and our specialized competitors may be more effective in devoting technical, marketing and financial resources to compete with us with respect to a particular product. some competitors may offer price incentives or different pricing structures that are more attractive to clients. the competitive landscape may also experience consolidation in the form of mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic partnerships, which result in a narrower pool of competitors that are better capitalized or that are able to gain a competitive advantage through synergies.
17
barriers to entry may be low or declining in many of the markets for our products and services, including for single-purpose product companies, which could lead to the emergence of new competitors. for example, more broker-dealers and data suppliers could begin developing their own proprietary risk analytics or indexes. recent developments, including increases in the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information, advances in cloud computing, increased use of open source code, as well as client development of proprietary applications in specific areas, have further reduced barriers to entry in some cases.
we may experience pressures to reduce our fees on account of financial and budgetary pressures affecting our clients, including those resulting from weak or volatile economic or market conditions, may lead certain clients to reduce their overall spending on our products or services, including by seeking similar products or services at a lower cost than what we are able to provide, by consolidating their spending with fewer providers, by consolidating with other clients or by self-sourcing certain of their informational and analytical needs. accordingly, competitive and market pressures may result in fewer clients or reduced sales, including as a result of client closures and consolidations, price reductions, prolonged selling and renewal cycles and increased operating costs, such as for marketing and product development, which could, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
to remain competitive, we must continually introduce new products and services, enhance existing products and services, including through integration of products and services within msci and with third-party platforms, and effectively generate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services. we may not be successful in developing, introducing, implementing, marketing, pricing, launching or licensing new products or enhancements on a timely or cost-effective basis or without impacting the stability and efficiency of existing products and systems. any new products and enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or industry standards or achieve market acceptance. we must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products and services that satisfy our clients' needs and generate revenues required to provide the desired results. from time to time, we also incur costs to integrate existing products and services and transition clients to enhanced products and services, which also present execution risks and challenges. if we are unable to effectively manage transitions to new or enhanced products and services, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
if we are unable to successfully identify, execute and realize synergies from acquisitions or strategic partnerships, or if we experience integration, financing, or other risks resulting from our acquisitions or strategic partnerships, our financial results may be materially adversely affected.
an element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions and strategic partnerships. despite our best efforts to continue pursuing such transactions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable strategic partners or candidates for successful acquisition at acceptable terms. our ability to achieve the expected returns and synergies from our past and future acquisitions and strategic partnerships depends, in part, upon our ability to effectively integrate the offerings, technology, sales, administrative functions and personnel of these businesses into our operations. we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses, that our acquired businesses will perform at the levels we anticipate or that our strategic partnerships will advance the long-term growth strategy of our company. our past and future acquisitions and strategic partnerships may subject us to unanticipated risks or liabilities, including the potential to disrupt our operations. any acquisition or strategic partnership could present a number of risks, including incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets or strategic partnerships, failure to achieve assumed synergies or successful integration of operations and management, increased debt associated with such transactions, dilution of our common stock, loss of key personnel and diversion of management's attention from existing operations. additionally, strategic partnerships may increase our reliance on third-parties, which may result in future disruptions if those partnerships are discontinued or the content or level of support provided by strategic partners is diminished.
in the event that we experience a high level of acquisition- or strategic partnership-related activity within a limited period of time, the probability that these risks would occur would likely increase. in addition, if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses or assets, executing strategic partnerships or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, our brand or reputation could suffer, and our future growth, business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
18
our global operations and any future expansion may continue to place significant strain on our management and other resources, as well as subject us to additional, and in some cases unanticipated, risks and costs in connection with political, economic, legal, operational and other issues resulting from our increased global footprint, which could materially adversely impact our businesses.
our global operations and any future expansion is expected to continue to place significant demands on our personnel, management and other resources. we must continue to improve our operational, financial, human resources, management, legal and compliance processes and information systems to keep pace with the expansion of our business. there can also be no assurance that, if in the future we expand organically or by way of acquisition, our management will be effective in attracting, engaging and retaining additional qualified personnel, including additional managers or key employees, developing effective leadership in all our locations, expanding our physical facilities and information technology infrastructure, integrating acquired businesses or otherwise managing expansion. additionally, new hires require significant training and may, in some cases, take a significant amount of time before becoming fully productive.
our global operations expose us to political, economic, legal, operational, franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries, including risks of possible capital controls, exchange controls, customs duties, sanctions compliance, tax penalties, levies or assessments, legal uncertainty, broad regulatory discretion and other restrictive governmental actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability in certain of the countries or regions in which we conduct operations. a significant number of our employees are located in offices outside of the u.s. and a number of those employees are located in emerging market locations. for example, as of december 31, 2019, 62.9% of our employees were located in emerging market locations. the cost of establishing and maintaining these offices, including costs related to information technology infrastructure, as well as the costs of attracting, training and retaining employees in these locations may be higher, or may increase at a faster rate, than we anticipate. additionally, public health epidemics impacting the global economy and our employees, such as covid-19 that originated in china and has had reverberating effects around the world, particularly in the apac region, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
the laws and regulations in many countries applicable to our business are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine and remain compliant with the exact requirements of local laws in every market. our inability to maintain consistent internal policies and procedures across our offices and remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally.
demand for our products and services is still nascent in many parts of the world, particularly in emerging market locations. many countries have not fully developed laws and regulations regarding risk management and esg and, in many cases, institutions in these countries have not developed widely accepted best practices regarding the same. if we do not appropriately tailor our products and services to fit the needs of the local market, we may be unable to effectively grow sales of our products and services outside of the u.s. there can be no assurances that demand for our products and services will develop in these countries.
any failure to effectively manage expansion or to effectively manage the business globally could damage our brand and reputation, result in increased costs and litigation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
legal and regulatory risks new regulations or changes to current regulations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
failure to comply with any applicable laws, rules or regulations could damage our brand and reputation, and we may become subject to litigation, regulatory actions, sanctions, fines or other penalties. the financial services industry, within which we and many of our clients operate, is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels, as well as by foreign governments, with some jurisdictions regulating indexes directly. these regulations are complex, evolve frequently and sometimes quickly and unexpectedly, and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that are difficult to predict, and could materially adversely affect our
19
business and our clients' businesses. uncertainty caused by political change in the u.s., europe and asia heightens regulatory uncertainty. additionally, we may be required to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, rules or regulations in various jurisdictions, which could, individually or in the aggregate, result in materially higher compliance costs to us. it is possible that laws or regulations could cause us to restrict or change the way we license and price our products and services or could impose additional costs on us. changes to the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our clients could limit our clients' ability to use our products and services or could otherwise impact our clients' demand for our products and services. as such, to the extent that our clients become subject to certain laws, rules or regulations, we may incur higher costs in connection with modifying our products or services.  to the extent that we rely on our clients and vendors to provide data for our products and services and certain laws, rules or regulations impact our clients' and vendors' ability or willingness to provide that data to us or regulate the fees for which such data can be provided, our ability to continue to produce our products and services or the related costs could be negatively impacted.  the regulations that most materially impact us are described below:
•   brexit. the united kingdom ("uk") exited the european union ("eu") on january 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as "brexit") and is currently in the transition period under the brexit withdrawal agreement, which ends as of the end of 2020 (but could be extended). negotiations on the terms of the uk's future relationship with the eu are ongoing, leading to increased legal uncertainty. any formal agreement or other developments regarding brexit could lead to additional legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations that negatively affect our business and could cause additional operating obligations and increased costs for our business. in particular, we will need to ensure that post-brexit we are licensed to provide indexes in the eu as well as the uk under each of the eu and uk benchmark regulations.

there is also uncertainty as to how the uk's access to the eu single market and the wider trading, legal, regulatory, tax and labor environments, especially in the uk and eu, will be impacted, including the resulting impact on our business and that of our clients. any such changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results because we have significant operations in europe and certain members of our senior management team are based in london. for example, changes in labor, immigration and tax laws could increase the cost to our staff of living and working in the uk or the eu and may impact our ability to hire and retain non-uk staff in the uk or uk staff in the eu. a change in such regulations, or other regulations, could increase our costs of doing business, or in some cases affect our ability to do business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   regulation affecting benchmarks. compliance efforts associated with regulations affecting benchmarks and the related technical standards and guidance could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. in particular, compliance could lead to a change in our business practices and/or our ability to offer indexes in certain jurisdictions, including the eu, including without limitation, by increasing our costs of doing business, including direct costs paid to regulators, diminishing our intellectual property rights, imposing constraints on our ability to meet contractual commitments to our data providers, or causing our data providers to refuse to provide data to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our index products.

for example, the benchmark industry is subject to regulations in the eu, such as regulation (eu) 2016/1011 and regulation (eu) no 600/2014, as well as increased scrutiny and potential new or increased regulation in various other jurisdictions. additionally, the european securities and markets authority ("esma") issues guidance from time to time regarding interpretations of the benchmark regulation. the esma guidelines on etfs and other ucits issues limit the types of indexes that can be used as the basis of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities ("ucits") funds and require, among other things, index constituents, together with their respective weightings, to be made easily accessible free of charge, such as via the internet, to investors and prospective investors on a delayed and periodic basis. the international organization of securities commissions ("iosco") recommends that benchmark administrators, on a voluntary basis, publicly disclose whether they comply with the principles for financial benchmarks published by iosco.  the heightened attention and scrutiny on benchmarks and index providers by regulators, policymakers and the media in the eu, the u.s. and other jurisdictions around the world could result
20
in negative publicity or comments about the role or influence of our company or the index industry generally, which could harm our reputation and credibility.
•   data privacy legislation. changes in laws, rules or regulations, or consumer environments relating to privacy or information collection and use may affect our ability to collect, manage, aggregate, store, transfer and use personal data. there could be a material adverse impact on our direct marketing due to the enactment of legislation or industry regulations, or simply a change in practices, arising from public concern over privacy issues. restrictions or bans could be placed upon the collection, management, aggregation, storage, transfer and use of information that is currently legally available, in which case our costs related to handling information could increase materially. recently, california passed the california consumer privacy act ("ccpa"), which took effect on january 1, 2020. the ccpa regulates the processing of personal data of all californians and imposes significant penalties for non-compliance. the european general data protection regulation imposes enhanced operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the eu and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. in japan, the act on the protection of personal information ("appi") regulates the use of personal information and personal data of "data subjects" for business purposes without regard to whether such use is within japan. in addition, other jurisdictions, including china and india, are considering imposing or have already imposed additional restrictions.

•   investment advisers act. except with respect to certain products provided by msci esg research llc and certain of its designated foreign affiliates, we believe that our products and services do not constitute or provide investment advice as contemplated by the advisers act. the advisers act imposes fiduciary duties, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on agency and principal transactions between an adviser and advisory clients, as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions. future developments in our product lines or changes to current laws, rules, regulations or interpretations could cause this status to change, requiring other entities in our corporate family to register as investment advisers under the advisers act or comply with similar laws or requirements in states or foreign jurisdictions. see part i, item 1. "business-government regulation" above for information about similar regulations in other countries.

in some instances, in connection with the provision of data and services, we have incurred additional costs to implement processes and systems at the request of our clients to ensure that the products and services that they in turn provide to their clients using our data are compliant with the financial regulations to which our clients may be subject. to the extent that our clients are subject to increased regulation, we may be indirectly impacted and could incur increased costs that could have a negative impact on the profitability of certain products.
additionally, there has been increased attention on and scrutiny of esg ratings providers by regulators, policymakers and the media, which could create negative publicity that could harm our reputation or credibility as well as result in new or additional regulation that could increase our costs and have a negative impact on profitability.
legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages. third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights or we may infringe upon their intellectual property rights, which, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we consider many aspects of our products and services to be proprietary. we rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademark rights, as well as technical measures and contractual protections, such as non-disclosure obligations, to protect our products and services. despite our best efforts, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights, and the rights of those from whom we license intellectual property, are adequate to prevent unauthorized use, misappropriation, distribution or theft of our intellectual property.
intellectual property laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to change at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. the enforceability of intellectual property
21
rights and obligations under our agreements, as well as the availability of remedies in the event of a breach, may vary due to the different jurisdictions in which our clients and employees are located.  failure to protect the company's intellectual property adequately could harm its brand and reputation and affect the company's ability to compete effectively.
there is no guarantee that any intellectual property rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages, nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights. furthermore, our competitors may independently develop and patent or otherwise protect products and services that are the same or similar to ours. we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property, or disclosure of confidential information, and take the necessary steps to enforce our rights. in addition, our services and products, or the products of others that we offer to our clients, could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties.
pursuing intellectual property claims or responding to intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, can consume valuable time, and result in costly litigation or delays, and there is no guarantee that the company will be successful. from time to time, we receive claims or notices from third parties alleging infringement or potential infringement of their intellectual property rights; and the number of these claims may grow. these intellectual property claims would likely be costly to defend and could require us to pay damages, limit our future use of certain technologies, harm our brand and reputation, significantly increase our costs and prevent us from offering some services or products.  we may need to settle such claims on unfavorable terms, pay damages, stop providing or using the affected products or services or enter into royalty and licensing agreements, which may include terms that are not commercially acceptable to us. from time to time we receive notices calling upon us to defend partners, clients, suppliers or distributors against third-party claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts. if any of these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
there have been a number of lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions, including in the u.s. and germany, regarding whether issuers of index-linked investment products are required to obtain a license from the index owner or whether issuers may issue investment products based on publicly-available index level data without obtaining permission from (or making payment to) the index owner. the outcome of these cases depends on a number of factors, including the governing law, the amount of information about the index available without a license and the other particular facts and circumstances of the cases. in some instances, the results have been unfavorable to the index owner. if courts or regulators or other governmental bodies in relevant jurisdictions determine that a license is not required to issue investment products linked to indexes, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. it might also lead to changes in current industry practices such that we would no longer make our index level data publicly available, such as via our website or news media, on a timely basis.
we may be exposed to liabilities as a result of failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or benefits or offers of payments or benefits to foreign governments and their officials and, in some cases, to employees of a business for the purpose of directing, obtaining or retaining business. we have business in countries and regions which are less developed and are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments. our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various anti-corruption laws including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended (the "fcpa") and the u.k. bribery act 2010. we have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents. however, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than fully effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. if employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions we may be subject to regulatory sanctions. violations of the fcpa or other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, damage our brand and reputation and subject us to other liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
22
in connection with our initial public offering and separation from morgan stanley, we entered into agreements with morgan stanley where we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for, among other things, certain past, present and future liabilities related to our business.
pursuant to certain agreements we entered into with morgan stanley relating to the provision of services and other matters, we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for, among other matters, certain past, present and future liabilities related to our business. such liabilities include certain unknown liabilities, which could be significant.
financial risks our business performance might not be sufficient for us to meet the full-year financial guidance or long-term targets that we provide publicly.
we provide full-year financial guidance and long-term targets to the public based upon our assumptions regarding our expected financial performance. for example, we provide assumptions regarding our ability to achieve certain subscription revenue growth, manage our expenses, generate free cash flow, achieve an effective tax rate within a certain range and achieve our profitability targets. while we believe that our annual financial guidance and long-term targets provide investors and analysts with insight to our view of the company's future performance, such financial guidance and long-term targets are based on assumptions that may not always prove to be accurate and may vary from actual results. if we fail to meet the full-year financial guidance or achieve the long-term targets that we provide, or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance or targets, the market value of our common stock or other securities could be adversely affected.
our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk.
we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk. exchange rate movements can impact the u.s. dollar reported value of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities denominated in non-u.s. dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded.  additionally, the value of assets in index-linked investment products can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and such volatility may be further impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. for additional information on our foreign currency exchange rate risk, see part ii, item 7a "-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk-foreign currency risk."
we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk, in part, through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. any derivative financial instruments that we are currently party to or may enter into in the future may not be successful, resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations.
to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase or decrease in the future, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may correspondingly increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  depending on the final terms reached between the uk and the eu, brexit has and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates, especially between the u.s. dollar and the british pound sterling. the weaker british pound sterling means that revenues earned in british pound sterling translate to lower reported u.s. dollar revenues.  the weaker british pound sterling also means that expenses incurred in british pound sterling translate to lower reported u.s. dollar expenses. the weaker british pound sterling could also impair the purchasing power of our clients and could result in decreased demand for our products and services. the fall in the british pound sterling relative to the u.s. dollar, and the strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to a number of currencies including the british pound sterling, could have significant impacts on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
23
our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility. our variable rate indebtedness could subject us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.
for an overview of our current outstanding indebtedness and history of our offerings, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" below. although we believe that our cash flows will be sufficient to service our outstanding indebtedness, we cannot provide assurance that we will generate and maintain cash flows sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. our ability to make payments on indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate and access cash in the future, which, in turn, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or access offshore cash, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity and we may not be able to secure additional financing on terms favorable or acceptable to us or at all. absent sufficient cash flow from our operations and the ability to refinance, we could also be forced to sell assets to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations. the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements, however, limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to sell assets and also restrict the use of proceeds from such a sale. if we cannot refinance or otherwise pay our obligations as they mature and fund our liquidity needs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and ability to compete in our industry could be materially adversely affected.
we may need to incur additional debt from time to time under our existing debt agreements to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. if we do so, the risks related to our level of indebtedness could intensify, including by making it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our business or placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.
furthermore, the terms of our debt agreements include restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, our and our existing and future subsidiaries' financial flexibility. if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, there could be a default that, in some cases, if continuing, could result in the accelerated payment of our debt obligations or the termination of borrowing commitments on the part of the lenders under our revolving credit agreement. see part ii, item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources" for a description of the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.
in 2017, the u.k. financial conduct authority (the "fca"), which regulates london interbank offered rate ("libor"), announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the libor benchmark after 2021. this announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021, and there is a substantial risk that libor will be discontinued or modified by the end of 2021, and although alternative reference rates have been proposed, it is unknown whether they will attain market acceptance as replacements of libor. at this time, it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments, any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to libor or any other reference rate, or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on libor, other benchmarks or floating rate debt instruments, including borrowings under the credit agreement, dated as of november 20, 2014, by and among the company, the guarantors party thereto, jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as administrative agent and the lenders from time to time party thereto, as amended, supplemented, modified or amended and restated from time to time (the "revolving credit facility"). the use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause the interest rate calculated for such borrowings to increase or otherwise fail to correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if libor was available in its current form, or have other adverse effects on us. to address the transition away from libor, our revolving credit facility provides for a process to amend our revolving credit facility to substitute libor with a replacement rate under certain circumstances. however, there is no guarantee that any such amendment for a replacement rate would become effective, and in the event that such amendment does not become effective, we may be required to pay a rate of interest higher than expected on the amount owed under our revolving credit facility.
24
a change in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our financial condition.
our credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any of our common stock or outstanding debt. our outstanding debt under the senior notes currently has non-investment grade ratings. any rating assigned to such debt is subject to ongoing evaluation by the credit rating agencies and could be lowered or withdrawn entirely at any time by either or both agencies if, in the agency's judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. such future circumstances include, but are not limited to, adverse changes to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, or revisions to our corporate strategy pertaining to capitalization or leverage. for example, on july 28, 2015, the board of directors authorized corporate action that led to a change in the company's target leverage and interest expense, allowing for the issuance of our 2025 senior notes on august 13, 2015. following the board of directors' authorization, one of the ratings agencies described the increase as substantially higher than current leverage levels and as a result downgraded our credit rating. this downgrade, and any further downgrade, could adversely affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financing we obtain.
in addition, our debt covenants contain certain obligations that are triggered by a change in our credit rating, including obligations to make repurchase offers to the noteholders of our senior notes if the following two conditions are met at the time of, or as a result of, a change of control or sale of substantially all of the company's assets: (i) the senior notes are rated below investment grade by each rating agency that rates the senior notes and (ii) the senior notes are downgraded by any rating agency.
any adverse change in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our liquidity and future growth through transactions in which we rely on the ability to receive debt capital at an advantageous cost and on favorable terms. accordingly, actual or anticipated changes or downgrades to or withdrawal of our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review or have been assigned a negative outlook, could result in damage to our brand and reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and on the market value of our common stock and outstanding debt.
we may have exposure to tax liabilities in various jurisdictions. future changes in tax law could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.
we are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income or indirect taxes, in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. in the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. changes in domestic and international tax laws could negatively impact our overall effective tax rate.  in particular, brexit could create uncertainty with respect to our corporate tax rate as well as the tax rates of our employees based in the uk.
the 2017 u.s. tax cuts and jobs act ("tax reform") was enacted on december 22, 2017, and significantly affected u.s. tax law by changing how the u.s. imposes income tax on multinational corporations. tax reform requires complex computations not previously provided in u.s. tax law. further, compliance with tax reform and the accounting for such provisions require accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced. the u.s. department of treasury has broad authority, and is continuing, to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and may impact our results of operations.
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe that our tax provisions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, such differences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of income for a particular future period. in addition, an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs.
25
our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions, could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, requiring us to record substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.
we have goodwill and intangible assets of $1,824.4 million recorded on our balance sheet as of december 31, 2019. we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists. intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. these impairment tests are based on several factors requiring management's judgment. changes in fair market valuations and our operating performance or business conditions, in general, could result in future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, if we are not successful in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies associated with acquisitions, our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations for the year ended december 31, 2019 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the discussion summarizing the significant factors affecting the results of operations and financial condition of msci for the year ended december 31, 2018 can be found in part ii, "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018 (the "2018 annual report"), which was filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 22, 2019.

in evaluating our financial performance, we focus on revenue and profit growth, including results accounted for under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap") as well as non-gaap measures, for the company as a whole and by operating segment. in addition, we focus on operating metrics, including run rate, subscription sales and retention rate, to manage the business. our business is not highly capital intensive and, as such, we expect to continue to convert a high percentage of our profits into excess cash in the future. our growth strategy includes: (a) expanding leadership in research-enhanced content, (b) strengthening existing and new client relationships by providing solutions, (c) improving access to our solutions through cutting-edge technology and platforms, (d) expanding value-added service offerings and (e) executing strategic relationships and acquisitions with complementary content and technology companies.
33
key financial metrics and drivers as discussed in the previous section, we utilize a portfolio of key financial metrics to manage the company, including gaap and non-gaap measures. as detailed below, we review revenues by type and by segment, or by major product line. we also review expenses by activity, which provides more transparency into how resources are being deployed. in addition, we utilize operating metrics including run rate, subscription sales and retention rate to analyze past performance and to provide insight into our latest reported portfolio of recurring business.
in the discussion that follows, we provide certain variances excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reflect the difference between the current period results as reported compared to the current period results recalculated using the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior period. while operating revenues adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations includes asset-based fees that have been adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the underlying aum, which is the primary component of asset-based fees, is not adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations. approximately two-thirds of the aum are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, and accordingly, any such impact is excluded from the disclosed foreign currency-adjusted variances.
revenues our revenues are characterized by type, which broadly reflects the nature of how they are recognized or earned. our revenue types are recurring subscription, asset-based fees and non-recurring revenues. we also group our revenues by segment and provide the revenue type within each segment.
recurring subscription revenues represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts and are generally recognized ratably over the term of the license or service pursuant to the contract terms. the fees are recognized as we provide the product and service to the client over the license period and are generally billed in advance, prior to the license start date.
asset-based fees represent fees earned on the aum linked to our indexes from independent third-party sources or the most recently reported information provided by the client. asset-based fees also include revenues related to futures and options contracts linked to our indexes, which are primarily based on trading volumes.
non-recurring revenues primarily represent fees earned on products and services where we do not have renewal contracts and primarily include revenues for providing historical data, certain implementation services and other special client requests, which are generally recognized at a point in time.
operating expenses we group our operating expenses into the following activity categories:
•   cost of revenues;

•   selling and marketing;

•   research and development ("r&amp;d");

•   general and administrative ("g&amp;a");

•   amortization of intangible assets; and

•   depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements.

costs are assigned to these activity categories based on the nature of the expense or, when not directly attributable, an estimated allocation based on the type of effort involved.
34
cost of revenues cost of revenues expenses consist of costs related to the production and servicing of our products and services and primarily includes related information technology costs, including data center, platform and infrastructure costs; costs to acquire, produce and maintain market data information; costs of research to support and maintain existing products; costs of product management teams; costs of client service and consultant teams to support customer needs; as well as other support costs directly attributable to the cost of revenues including certain human resources, finance and legal costs.
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist of costs associated with acquiring new clients or selling new products or product renewals to existing clients and primarily includes the costs of our sales and marketing teams, as well as costs incurred in other groups associated with acquiring new business, including product management, research, technology and sales operations.
research and development r&d expenses consist of costs to develop new or enhance existing products and costs to develop new or improved technology and service platforms for the delivery of our products and services and primarily include the costs of development, research, product management, project management and the technology support associated with these efforts.
general and administrative g&a expenses consist of costs primarily related to finance operations, human resources, office of the ceo, legal, corporate technology, corporate development and certain other administrative costs that are not directly attributed, but are instead allocated, to a product or service.
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets expense relates to definite-lived intangible assets arising from past acquisitions and internal capitalized software projects. intangibles arising from past acquisitions consist of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, technology and software, proprietary processes and data and non-competition agreements. we amortize definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. definite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when impairment indicators are present, and, if impaired, written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. we have no indefinite-lived intangible assets.
depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements this category consists of expenses related to depreciating or amortizing the cost of furniture and fixtures, computer and related equipment and leasehold improvements over the estimated useful life of the assets.
other expense (income), net this category consists primarily of interest we pay on our outstanding indebtedness, interest we collect on cash and short-term investments, foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses as well as other non-operating income and expense items.
35
non-gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda
"adjusted ebitda," a non-gaap measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as net income before (1) provision for income taxes, (2) other expense (income), net, (3) depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, (4) amortization of intangible assets and, at times, (5) certain other transactions or adjustments, including the impact related to the vesting of multi-year restricted stock units granted in 2016 to certain senior executives that are subject to the achievement of multi-year total shareholder return targets, which are performance targets with a market condition (the "2016 multi-year psus").
"adjusted ebitda expenses," a non-gaap measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as operating expenses less depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets and, at times, certain other transactions or adjustments, including the impact related to the vesting of the 2016 multi-year psus.
adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses are believed to be meaningful measures of the operating performance of the company because they adjust for significant one-time, unusual or non-recurring items as well as eliminate the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions that do not directly affect what management considers to be the company's core operating performance in the period. all companies do not calculate adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses in the same way. these measures can differ significantly from company to company depending on, among other things, long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. accordingly, the company's computation of the adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures computed by other companies.
run rate run rate is a key operating metric and is important because an increase or decrease in our run rate ultimately impacts our operating revenues over time. at the end of any period, we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of total revenues for the following 12 months. we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as "run rate." see "-operating metrics-run rate" below for additional information on the calculation of this metric.
subscription sales subscription sales is a key operating metric and is important because new subscription sales increase our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time. see "-operating metrics-subscription sales" below for additional information.
retention rate another key operating metric is retention rate which is important because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time. see "-operating metrics-retention rate" below for additional information on the calculation of this metric.

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. we believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made. to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. see note 1, "introduction and basis of presentation-significant accounting policies," and note 2, "recent accounting standards updates," of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for a listing of our accounting policies.
factors affecting the comparability of results divestitures on april 9, 2018, we completed the divestiture of fea for $21.0 million in cash, which resulted in a gain of $10.6 million. fea was included as a component of the analytics segment through the date of divestiture. the results of operations from fea were not material to the company.
on october 12, 2018, we completed the divestiture of investorforce and received $62.8 million in cash, which resulted in a gain of $46.6 million. investorforce was included as a component of the analytics segment through the date of divestiture. the results of operations from investorforce were not material to the company.
share repurchases the board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program for the purchase of the company's common stock. see note 10, "shareholders' equity (deficit)," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our stock repurchase program.
the weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate our diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2019 decreased by 4.6% compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. the decrease primarily reflects the impact of share repurchases made prior to march 31, 2019 pursuant to the 2016 and 2018 repurchase programs and the vesting of the restricted stock units that were included in the dilutive share count in the prior year.
senior notes we have an aggregate $3,100.0 million of senior notes outstanding as of december 31, 2019. see "-liquidity and capital resources-senior notes and credit agreement" below and note 5, "commitments and contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our senior notes and revolving credit agreement.
tax cuts and jobs act of 2017
tax reform which was enacted on december 22, 2017, significantly revised the u.s. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering u.s. corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time tax on deemed repatriation of historic earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the "toll charge").
in the year ended december 31, 2018, the company finalized the toll charge and determined the final impact of tax reform, resulting in a net benefit of $11.2 million that included a benefit of $5.7 million on the true-up of the toll charge and a benefit of $2.6 million for a reduction in the expected withholding taxes from foreign subsidiaries. the company also recorded a benefit of $2.9 million related to the revaluation of deferred taxes at the lower statutory rate as a result of tax planning.

total operating revenues grew 8.6% to $1,557.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $1,434.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, total operating revenues would have increased 8.9% for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.

revenue from recurring subscriptions increased 8.2% to $1,154.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $1,066.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily driven by growth in index products, which increased $53.4 million, or 11.2%, and growth in all other products, which increased $22.2 million, or 19.4%. adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, recurring subscriptions would have increased 8.5% for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.
revenues from asset-based fees increased 7.5% to $361.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $336.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in asset-based fees was primarily driven by an increase in revenues from exchange traded futures and options contracts linked to msci indexes. the increase in revenues from futures and options contracts was driven by approximately $5.0 million in additional fees associated with prior periods attributed to a retrospective price increase from a renegotiated contract entered into during the year ended december 31, 2019, as well as the cumulative impact of price and volume increases. the increase in revenues from asset-based fees was also driven by higher revenues from etfs linked to msci indexes which was driven by a 7.6% increase in average aum, partially offset by the impact of a change in product mix. in addition, the increase in revenues from asset-based fees was driven by higher revenues from non-etf passive products linked to msci indexes. the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues from asset-based fees was negligible.

compensation and benefits costs for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased 10.0% to $518.7 million compared to $471.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, driven by $15.4 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 multi-year psus, higher severance costs, incentive compensation, wages and salaries and benefit costs.
non-compensation expenses for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased 7.4% to $204.0 million compared to $189.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily driven by higher costs relating to professional fees, information technology costs, recruiting costs, travel and entertainment costs, marketing and personnel related costs.
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets expense for the year ended december 31, 2019 decreased 8.8% to $49.4 million compared to $54.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily driven by the absence of amortization following the write-off of the ipd trade name used by the real estate segment in june 2018 and the october 2018 investorforce divestiture, partially offset by higher amortization of internally-developed capitalized software.
depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements for the year ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 was $30.0 million and $31.3 million, respectively.
other expense (income), net other expense (income), net for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased 167.3% to $152.4 million compared to $57.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was primarily driven by the absence of the $46.6 million and $10.6 million of gains realized from the investorforce and fea divestitures, respectively, which occurred in 2018. the increase was also driven by the $16.8 million loss on extinguishment associated with the partial pre-maturity redemption of the 2024 senior notes which included approximately $13.1 million of call premium paid in accordance with the redemption prices set forth in the indenture and the write-off of approximately $3.7 million of unamortized costs associated with the 2024 senior notes. in addition, the increase also reflects higher interest expense associated with higher outstanding debt and higher foreign currency exchange losses.
income taxes the provision for income tax decreased 67.5% to $39.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $122.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. these amounts reflect effective tax rates of 6.6% and 19.4% for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
the effective tax rate of 6.6% for the year ended december 31, 2019 reflects the impact of certain favorable discrete items totaling $85.7 million. these discrete items primarily relate to $66.6 million of excess tax benefits recognized upon vesting of the 2016 multi-year psus and $16.1 million of excess tax benefits on other share-based compensation recognized during the period. in addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by a beneficial geographic mix of earnings.
the effective tax rate of 19.4% for the year ended december 31, 2018 reflects the impact of certain favorable discrete items totaling $31.9 million. these discrete items include $8.8 million of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, $11.9 million related to the release of valuation allowances previously recorded on capital loss carryforwards and $11.2 million related to the final impact of tax reform.
42
net income as a result of the factors described above, net income for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased 11.0% to $563.6 million compared to $507.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018.

revenues from recurring subscriptions were up 11.2% to $531.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $477.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was driven by strong growth in core developed market modules, factor and esg index products and emerging market modules. the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues from recurring subscriptions was negligible.

revenues from asset-based fees increased 7.5% to $361.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $336.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in asset-based fees was primarily driven by an increase in revenues from exchange traded futures and options contracts linked to msci indexes. the increase in revenues from futures and options contracts was driven by approximately $5.0 million in additional fees associated with prior periods attributed to a retrospective price increase from a renegotiated contract entered into during the year ended december 31, 2019, as well as the cumulative impact of price and volume increases. the increase in revenues from asset-based fees was also driven by higher revenues from etfs linked to msci indexes, which was driven by a 7.6% increase in average aum, partially offset by the impact of a change in product mix. in addition, the increase in revenues from asset-based fees was driven by higher revenues from non-etf passive products linked to msci indexes. the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues from asset-based fees was negligible.
index segment adjusted ebitda expenses increased 10.2% to $250.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $227.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, reflecting higher expenses across all expense activity categories to fund current and future revenue growth. adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, adjusted ebitda expenses would have increased 12.1% for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.

analytics segment revenues increased 3.5% to $496.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $479.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily driven by strong growth in multi-asset class products as well as the timing of client implementations, partially offset by declines from the october 2018 investorforce divestiture and the april 2018 fea divestiture. the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on analytics segment revenues was negligible. adjusting for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and excluding the impact of the investorforce and fea divestitures, analytics segment revenues would have increased 7.5% for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.
analytics segment adjusted ebitda expenses increased 2.5% to $344.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $336.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily driven by higher expenses across the selling and marketing and r&d expense activity categories, partially offset by lower expenses across the cost of sales expense activity category. adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, adjusted ebitda expenses would have increased 4.0% for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.

all other segment revenues increased 18.0% to $139.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $118.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in all other revenues was driven by a $19.3 million, or 27.0%, increase in esg revenues to $90.7 million and by a $2.1 million, or 4.4%, increase in real estate revenues to $49.3 million. the increase in esg revenues was driven by strong growth in the esg ratings products and the esg screening products. the increase in real estate revenues was primarily driven by strong growth in our global intel products. adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, all other operating revenues would have increased 21.6%, esg revenues would have increased 29.5% and real estate revenues would have increased 9.7% for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and excluding the impact of the carbon delta acquisition, esg revenues would have increased 29.3%.
all other segment adjusted ebitda expenses increased 14.4% to $111.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $97.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, driven by higher expenses attributable mostly to esg operations. adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, adjusted ebitda expenses would have increased 16.8% for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.
operating metrics run rate
"run rate" estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client license agreements ("client contracts") for the next 12 months, assuming all client contracts that come up for renewal are renewed and assuming then-current currency exchange rates, subject to the adjustments and exclusions described below.  for any client contract where fees are linked to an investment product's assets or trading volume/fees, the run rate calculation reflects, for etfs, the market value on the last trading day of the period, for futures and options, the most recent quarterly volumes and/or reported exchange fees, and for other non-etf products, the most recent client-reported assets. run rate does not include fees associated with "one-time" and other non-recurring transactions.  in addition, we add to run rate the annualized fee value of recurring new sales, whether to existing or new clients, when we execute client contracts, even though the license start date, and associated revenue recognition, may not be effective until a later date.  we remove from run rate the annualized fee value associated with products or services under any client contract with respect to which we have received a notice of termination or non-renewal during the period and have determined that such notice evidences the client's final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable products or services, even though such notice is not effective until a later date.
46
changes in our recurring revenues typically lag changes in run rate. the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate for numerous reasons, including:
•   fluctuations in revenues associated with new recurring sales;

•   modifications, cancellations and non-renewals of existing client contracts, subject to specified notice requirements;

•   differences between the recurring license start date and the date the client contract is executed due to, for example, contracts with onboarding periods;

•   fluctuations in asset-based fees, which may result from changes in certain investment products' total expense ratios, market movements, including foreign currency exchange rates, or from investment inflows into and outflows from investment products linked to our indexes;

•   fluctuations in fees based on trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to our indexes;

•   fluctuations in the number of hedge funds for which we provide investment information and risk analysis to hedge fund investors;

•   price changes;

•   revenue recognition differences under u.s. gaap, including those related to the timing of implementation and report deliveries for certain of our products and services;

•   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and

•   the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.

total run rate grew 14.2% to $1,634.5 million as of december 31, 2019 compared to $1,431.3 million as of december 31, 2018. recurring subscription run rate grew 10.6% to $1,238.3 million as of december 31, 2019 compared to $1,119.4 million as of december 31, 2018. adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, recurring subscription run rate would have increased 10.6% as of december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018.
47
run rate from asset-based fees increased 27.0% to $396.1 million as of december 31, 2019, from $311.9 million as of december 31, 2018, driven by higher aum in etfs linked to msci indexes as well as higher aum in non-etf passive funds also linked to msci indexes and higher fees in futures and options. as of december 31, 2019, the value of aum in etfs linked to msci indexes was $934.4 billion, up $238.8 billion, or 34.3%, from $695.6 billion as of december 31, 2018. the increase of $238.8 billion consisted of net inflows of $91.3 billion and a market appreciation of $147.5 billion. partially offsetting the impact of the increase in aum in etfs linked to msci indexes was a change in product mix, which was the primary driver of a decline in average basis point fees to 2.82 at december 31, 2019 from 2.92 at december 31, 2018.
index recurring subscription run rate grew 11.3% to $559.3 million as of december 31, 2019 compared to $502.7 million as of december 31, 2018, primarily driven by strong growth in core developed and emerging market modules and factor, esg and custom index products with strong growth across our asset management clients and growth across our banking, hedge fund, wealth management and asset owner clients.
run rate from analytics products increased 7.1% to $526.8 million as of december 31, 2019 compared to $491.9 million as of december 31, 2018, primarily driven by strong growth in both multi-asset class and equity analytics products. adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, analytics run rate would have increased 7.2% as of december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018.
run rate from all other products increased 21.9% to $152.2 million at december 31, 2019 compared to $124.9 million at december 31, 2018. the $27.4 million increase was primarily driven by a $21.9 million, or 27.6%, increase in esg run rate to $101.4 million, and a $5.4 million, or 12.0%, increase in real estate run rate to $50.8 million. the increase in esg run rate was primarily driven by strong growth in esg ratings products and esg screening products. the increase in real estate run rate was primarily driven by growth in market information products. adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, all other run rate would have increased 21.7%, esg run rate would have increased 27.6% and real estate run rate would have increased 11.3% at december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018.

retention rate is an important metric because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time. the annual retention rate represents the retained subscription run rate (subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year less actual cancels during the year) as a percentage of the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year.
the retention rate for a non-annual period is calculated by annualizing the cancellations for which we have received a notice of termination or for which we believe there is an intention not to renew during the non-annual period, and we believe that such notice or intention evidences the client's final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable agreement, even though such notice is not effective until a later date. this annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year to calculate a cancellation rate. this cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100% to derive the annualized retention rate for the period.
for example, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded cancellations of $19.9 million. to derive the retention rate for the fourth quarter, we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of $19.9 million to derive $79.7 million of annualized cancellations. this $79.7 million was then divided by the $1,119.4 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to derive a cancellation rate of 7.1%. the 7.1% was then subtracted from 100.0% to derive a retention rate of 92.9% for the fourth quarter.
retention rate is computed by operating segment on a product/service-by-product/service basis. in general, if a client reduces the number of products or services to which it subscribes within a segment, or switches between products or services within a segment, we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our retention rate except in the case of a product or service switch that management considers to be a replacement product or service. in those replacement cases, only the net change to the client subscription, if a decrease, is reported as a cancel.  in the analytics and the esg segments, substantially all product or service switches are treated as replacement products or services and netted in this manner, while in our index and real estate segments, product or service switches that are treated as replacement products or services and receive netting treatment occur only in certain limited instances. in addition, we treat any reduction in fees resulting from a down-sale of the same product or service as a cancellation to the extent of the reduction. we do not calculate retention rate for that portion of our run rate attributable to assets in index-linked investment products or futures and options contracts, in each case, linked to our indexes.
for the year ended december 31, 2019, 33.3% of our cancellations occurred in the fourth quarter. in our product lines, retention rate is generally higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth quarter, as the fourth quarter is traditionally the largest renewal period in the year.

liquidity and capital resources we require capital to fund ongoing operations, internal growth initiatives and acquisitions. our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, existing cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our existing credit facilities. in addition, we believe we have access to additional funding in the public and private markets. we intend to use these sources of liquidity to, among other things, service our existing and future debt obligations, fund our working capital requirements for capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. in connection with our business strategy, we regularly evaluate acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities. we believe our liquidity, along with other financing alternatives, will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth.
senior notes and credit agreement we have an aggregate of $3,100.0 million in senior unsecured notes (collectively, the "senior notes") consisting of five discrete private placement offerings and entered into a $400.0 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks. see note 5, "commitments and contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our senior notes and revolving credit agreement.
the senior notes and the revolving credit agreement are fully and unconditionally, and jointly and severally, guaranteed by our direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that account for more than 5% of our and our subsidiaries' consolidated assets, other than certain excluded subsidiaries (the "subsidiary guarantors"). amounts due under the revolving credit agreement are our and the subsidiary guarantors' senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with the senior notes and any of our other unsecured, unsubordinated debt, senior to any of our subordinated debt and effectively subordinated to our secured debt to the extent of the assets securing such debt.
the indentures governing our senior notes (the "indentures") among us, each of the subsidiary guarantors, and wells fargo bank, national association, as trustee, contain covenants that limit our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. in addition, the indentures restrict our non-guarantor subsidiaries' ability to create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness without such non-guarantor subsidiaries guaranteeing the senior notes on a pari passu basis.
the revolving credit agreement contains affirmative and restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our existing or future subsidiaries to:
•   incur liens and further negative pledges;

•   incur additional indebtedness or prepay, redeem or repurchase indebtedness;

•   make loans or hold investments;

•   merge, dissolve, liquidate, consolidate with or into another person;

•   enter into acquisition transactions;

•   enter into sale/leaseback transactions;

•   issue disqualified capital stock;

•   sell, transfer or dispose of assets;

•   pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of our capital stock or engage in stock repurchases, redemptions and other restricted payments;

•   create new subsidiaries;

•   permit certain restrictions affecting our subsidiaries;

•   change the nature of our business, accounting policies or fiscal periods;

51
•   enter into any transactions with affiliates other than on an arm's-length basis; and

•   amend our organizational documents or amend, modify or change the terms of certain agreements relating to our indebtedness.

the revolving credit agreement and the indentures also contain customary events of default, including those relating to non-payment, breach of representations, warranties or covenants, cross-default and cross-acceleration, bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity or impairment of loan documentation or collateral, change of control and customary erisa defaults. none of the restrictions above are expected to impact our ability to effectively operate the business.
the revolving credit agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve financial and operating results sufficient to maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis through the termination of the revolving credit agreement: (1) the maximum consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit agreement) measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis shall not exceed 4.25:1.00 and (2) the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit agreement) measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis shall be at least 4.00:1.00. as of december 31, 2019, our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.30:1.00 and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 6.42:1.00. there have been no amounts drawn under the revolving credit agreement since it was entered into on november 20, 2014.
our non-guarantor subsidiaries of the senior notes consist of: (i) domestic subsidiaries of the company that account for 5% or less of consolidated assets of the company and its subsidiaries and (ii) any foreign or domestic subsidiary of the company that is deemed to be a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended. our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $883.4 million, or 56.7%, of our total revenue for the 12 months ended december 31, 2019, approximately $267.0 million, or 35.3%, of our consolidated operating income for the 12 months ended december 31, 2019, and approximately $910.1 million, or 21.6%, of our consolidated total assets (excluding intercompany assets) and $624.3 million, or 14.6%, of our consolidated total liabilities, in each case as of december 31, 2019.
share repurchases the board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program for the purchase of the company's common stock in the open market. see note 10, "shareholders' equity (deficit)," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our stock repurchase program.
as of february 12, 2020, a total of $1,456.1 million remained available on the share repurchase authorization. this authorization may be modified, suspended or terminated by the board of directors at any time without prior notice.
cash dividends on september 17, 2014, our board of directors approved a plan to initiate a regular quarterly cash dividend to our shareholders. on october 30, 2014, we began paying regular quarterly cash dividends and have paid such dividends each quarter thereafter.
on january 29, 2020, the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share of common stock to be paid on march 6, 2020 to shareholders of record as of the close of trading on february 21, 2020.

cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents were $1,506.6 million and $904.2 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. we seek to maintain minimum cash balances globally of approximately $200.0 million to $250.0 million for general operating purposes. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, $321.2 million and $275.6 million, respectively, of the cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. as a result of tax reform, we can now more efficiently access a significant portion of our cash held outside of the u.s. in the short-term without being subject to u.s. income taxes. repatriation of some foreign cash may be subject to certain withholding taxes in local jurisdictions and other distribution restrictions. the global cash and cash equivalent balances that are maintained will be available to meet our global needs whether for general corporate purpose or other needs, including acquisitions or expansion of our products.
cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. cash provided by operating activities was $709.5 million and $612.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher cash collections from customers and the benefit of lower payments for income taxes, partially offset by higher payments for cash expenses and interest.
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for the payment of cash compensation expenses, office rent, technology costs, market data costs, interest expenses and income taxes. historically, the payment of cash for compensation and benefits is at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year.
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities was $71.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $34.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the year-over-year change was primarily driven by the absence of the proceeds received from the investorforce and fea divestitures in 2018 and the acquisition payment of carbon delta.
53
cash flows from financing activities cash used in financing activities was $36.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $626.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the year-over-year change primarily reflects lower share repurchases and the proceeds from the $1,000.0 million 2029 senior notes offering in november 2019, partially offset by the payment for the pre-maturity redemption or repurchase of the $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 senior notes and higher dividend payments.
we believe that global cash flows from operations, together with existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available under our existing credit facility and our ability to access the debt and capital markets for additional funds, will continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as material capital expenditures and share repurchases, for at least the 12 months following issuance of this form 10-k and for the foreseeable future thereafter. in addition, we expect that foreign cash flows from operations, together with existing cash and cash equivalents, will continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the 12 months following issuance of this form 10-k and for the foreseeable future thereafter.
contractual obligations our contractual obligations consist primarily of leases for office space, leases for equipment and other operating leases, obligations to vendors arising out of market data contracts and our debt obligations arising from the issuance of the senior notes. the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of december 31, 2019:

the obligations related to our uncertain tax positions, which are not considered material, have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and final amounts of any settlement.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2019 and 2018, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

item 1a.    risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10-k should be considered. the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impact our business operations. if any of the following risks occur, our business including its financial performance, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.
risks related to our industry conditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our business.
our financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry. automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates, consumer credit, and consumer spending and preferences. economic declines that result in significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have an adverse effect on our sales to oems.
we face strong competition.
we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours. price, quality, delivery, technological innovation, engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition. our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major oem customers, as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers. a number of our competitors are larger than we are, and some competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. although oems have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers, a number of our major oem customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products. these oems could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply. our traditional oem customers, faced with intense international competition, have continued to expand their worldwide sourcing of components. as a result, we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages, such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs, lower tax rates and, in some cases, export or raw materials subsidies. increased competition could adversely affect our business. in addition, any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do, develop products that are superior to our products, produce similar products at a cost that is lower than our cost, or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. as a result, our products may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors' products, and we may not be able to meet the growing demands of customers. these trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products.
if we do not respond appropriately, the evolution of the automotive industry could adversely affect our business.
the automotive industry is increasingly focused on the development of hybrid and electric vehicles and of advanced driver assistance technologies, with the goal of developing and introducing a commercially-viable, fully-automated driving experience. there has also been an increase in consumer preferences for mobility on demand services, such as car and ride sharing, as opposed to automobile ownership, which may result in a long-term reduction in the number of vehicles per capita. in addition, some industry participants are exploring transportation through alternatives to automobiles. these evolving areas have also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry. if we do not continue to innovate and develop, or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to oem and consumer preferences, this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
the increased adoption of gasoline and hybrid propulsion systems in western europe may materially reduce the demand for our current products.
the industry mix shift away from diesel propulsion systems in western europe has resulted and is expected to result in lower demand for current diesel components. this shift is expected to drive further increased demand for gasoline and hybrid propulsion systems. although we have developed and are currently in production with products for gasoline and hybrid propulsion systems and industry penetration rates for these products are expected to increase over the next several years, due to the high current penetration rates of our key technologies on diesel propulsion systems, this industry mix shift could adversely impact our near-term results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
risks related to our business we are under substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of our products.
there is substantial and continuing pressure on oems to reduce costs, including costs of products we supply. oem customers expect annual price reductions in our business. to maintain our profit margins, we seek price reductions from our suppliers, improved production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency, and streamlined product designs to reduce costs, and we attempt to develop new products, the benefits of which support stable or increased prices. our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our oem customers is limited, with cost recovery often less than 100% and often on a delayed basis. inability to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions, increases in raw material costs, and increases in employee wages and benefits could have an adverse effect on our business.
we continue to face volatile costs of commodities used in the production of our products.
the company uses a variety of commodities (including aluminum, copper, nickel, plastic resins, steel, other raw materials and energy) and materials purchased in various forms such as castings, powder metal, forgings, stampings and bar stock. increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results. we have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material pass-through provision in our customer contracts wherever possible and by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures. customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any increases in the cost of materials. the discontinuation or lessening of our ability to pass through or hedge increasing commodity costs could adversely affect our business.
from time to time, commodity prices may also fall rapidly. if this happens, suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions. the same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers. if these supply interruptions occur, it could adversely affect our business.
changes in u.s. administrative policy, including changes to existing trade agreements and any resulting changes in international trade relations, may have an adverse effect on us.
the united states has implemented tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. the united states has also implemented tariffs on items imported by us from china or other countries and may implement tariffs on additional products and export controls on additional items. the impact of these tariffs has increased the cost of raw materials and components we purchase and additional tariffs would likely result in additional increases. the imposition of tariffs by the united states has resulted in retaliatory tariffs from a number of countries, including china, which increase the cost of products we sell. a continuing trade war could have a negative impact on the global market and a more significant adverse effect on our business. the potential imposition of additional tariffs on chinese imports and imports of automobiles, including cars, suvs, vans and light trucks, and automotive parts could increase our costs and could result in lowering our gross margin on products sold.
we use important intellectual property in our business. if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.
we own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. our inability to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or claims that we are infringing intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business and our competitive position.
we are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology (it) systems.
to improve efficiency and reduce costs, we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing, payroll, and general management operations. if the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled, key business processes could be interrupted, which could adversely affect our business.
a failure of or disruption in our information technology infrastructure, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could adversely impact our business and operations.
we rely on the capacity, reliability and security of our it systems and infrastructure. it systems are vulnerable to disruptions, including those resulting from natural disasters, cyber attacks or failures in third-party-provided services. disruptions and attacks on our it systems pose a risk to the security of our systems and our ability to protect our networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of information and data and that of third parties, including our employees. some cyber attacks depend on human error or manipulation, including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or carry out disbursement of funds or other frauds, which raise the risks from such events and the costs associated with protecting against such attacks. although we have implemented security policies, processes, and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information, and disruptions of our operations, we have been, and likely will continue to be, subjected to such attacks or disruptions. future attacks or disruptions could potentially lead to the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, including our intellectual property, improper use of our systems and networks, access to and manipulation and destruction of company or third party data, production downtimes, lost revenues, inappropriate disbursement of funds and both internal and external supply shortages. in addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by such attacks or disruptions in the future. these consequences could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers, lead to claims against the company and ultimately adversely affect our business.
our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.
our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide. in particular, any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees and employees with technical and software capabilities in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business.
our profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected by program launch difficulties.
the launch of new business is a complex process, the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the production readiness of our manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. our failure to successfully launch new business, or our inability to accurately estimate the cost to design, develop and launch new business, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.
to the extent we are not able to successfully launch new business, vehicle production at our customers could be significantly delayed or shut down. such situations could result in significant financial penalties to us or a diversion of personnel and financial resources to improving launches rather than investment in continuous process improvement or other growth initiatives, and could result in our customers shifting work away from us to a competitor, all of which could result in loss of revenue, or loss of market share and could have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows.
part of our workforce is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages.
as of december 31, 2019, approximately 13% of our u.s. workforce was unionized. we have a domestic collective bargaining agreement for one facility in new york, which expires in september 2020. the workforce at certain of our international facilities is also unionized. a prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business.
work stoppages, production shutdowns and similar events could significantly disrupt our business.
because the automotive industry relies heavily on just-in-time delivery of components during the assembly and manufacture of vehicles, a work stoppage or production shutdown at one or more of our manufacturing and assembly facilities could have adverse effects on our business. similarly, if one or more of our customers were to experience a work stoppage or production shutdown, that customer would likely halt or limit purchases of our products, which could result in the shutdown of the related manufacturing facilities. a significant disruption in the supply of a key component due to a work stoppage or production shutdown at one of our suppliers or any other supplier could have the same consequences and, accordingly, have an adverse effect on our financial results.
changes in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability.
we have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. the valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets is subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline. such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future. additionally, a material deterioration in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our pension expenses and reduce profitability in the future.
we also sponsor post-employment medical benefit plans in the u.s. that are unfunded. if medical costs continue to increase or actuarial assumptions are modified, this could have an adverse effect on our business.
we are subject to extensive environmental regulations.
our operations are subject to laws governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharges to waters, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas, and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result. through various acquisitions over the years, we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities, and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership. in addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with evolving interpretations of existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or any new such laws and regulations (including concerns about global climate change and its impact) that may be adopted in the future. costs associated with failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business.
we have liabilities related to environmental, product warranties, litigation and other claims.
we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws, and, as such, may be liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at such sites. while responsibility for clean-up and other remedial activities at such sites is typically shared among potentially responsible parties based on an allocation formula, we could have greater liability under applicable statutes. refer to note 15, "contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further discussion.
we provide product warranties to our customers for some of our products. under these product warranties, we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products. as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions, auto manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product warranty claims. a recall claim brought against us, or a product warranty claim brought against us, could adversely impact our results of operations. in addition, a recall claim could require us to review our entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other product lines, which could result in significant disruption to our business and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. we cannot assure that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such product warranties in our financial statements.
we are currently, and may in the future become, subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. these claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include, but not be limited to, commercial or contractual disputes with our customers and suppliers, intellectual property matters, personal injury, product liability, environmental and employment claims. there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate. while the company maintains insurance for certain risks, the amount of insurance may not be adequate to cover all insured claims and liabilities. the incurring of significant liabilities for which there is no, or insufficient, insurance coverage could adversely affect our business.
compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results.
we have operations in multiple countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate. compliance-related issues in certain countries associated with laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-corruption laws could adversely affect our business. we have internal policies and procedures relating to compliance with such laws; however, there is a risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the improper acts of employees, agents, business partners, joint venture partners, or representatives, particularly in the case of recently-acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures. violations of these laws, which are complex, may result in criminal penalties, sanctions and/or fines that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and reputation.
changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation, new regulations, new policies, investigations and legal proceedings, and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations, in particular, changes in import and export control laws or exchange control laws, additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions, and changes in laws in countries where we operate or intend to operate.
changes in tax laws or tax rates taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could adversely affect our business.
changes in tax laws or tax rates, the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities, and the inability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could adversely affect our operating results. in addition, we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization.
if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings, our effective tax rate could be materially affected. our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business. we have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals and/or litigation regarding these matters. these audits may result in assessment of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts. we believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law. resolution of any tax matters involves uncertainties, and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable.
our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful.
we have a stated goal of increasing sales and operating income at a rate greater than growth, if any, in global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions.
we may not meet our goal due to many factors, including any of the risks identified in the paragraph that follows, failure to develop new products that our customers will purchase, technology changes that could render our products obsolete, and a reversal of the trend of supplying systems (which allows us to increase content per vehicle) instead of components, among other things.
we expect to continue to pursue business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities, enhance our customer base, geographic representation, and scale to complement our current businesses, and we regularly evaluate potential growth opportunities, some of which could be material. while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our long-term strategy, there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities. assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence. however, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity can be limited, and we can give no assurance that past or future business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned. we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we have acquired or acquire in the future, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. the integration of companies that we have acquired or will acquire in the future may be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected. revenues following the acquisition of a company may be lower than expected, customer loss and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, or suppliers) may be greater than expected, and we may not be able to retain key employees at the acquired company. we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company. if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully, our business, reputation and operating results could be adversely affected. likewise, our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies or realize certain synergies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances. failure to execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business.
our proposed acquisition of delphi technologies is subject to conditions, as well as other uncertainties, and there can be no assurances as to whether or when it may be completed. failure to complete the proposed transaction could adversely affect our business.
the completion of our proposed acquisition of delphi technologies is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, the approval by delphi technologies stockholders and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, which make the completion and timing of the completion of the proposed transaction uncertain. if the proposed transaction is not completed, our business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the proposed transaction, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:
•a potential decline to the market price of our common stock;
•   an inability to find another acquisition, with comparable electronic components, systems and technical capabilities;
•   a loss of time and resources that our management redirected to matters relating to the proposed transaction that could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; and
•   potential negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers, suppliers, or employees.
in addition, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the proposed transaction. the materialization of any of these risks could adversely impact our ongoing businesses. similarly, delays in the completion of the proposed transaction could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or personnel, or other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the proposed transaction.
we are subject to risks related to our international operations.
we have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions including europe, asia, and the americas. for 2019, approximately 77% of our consolidated net sales were outside the u.s. consequently, our results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, trade restrictions or prohibitions, import or other charges or taxes, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, limitations on the repatriation of funds, changing economic conditions, unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems, insufficient infrastructures, social unrest, political instability and disputes, international terrorism and other factors that may be discrete to a particular country or geography. compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is challenging, burdensome and expensive.
the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to u.s. dollars using the period-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for each period for revenues, expenses and capital expenditures. the local currency is typically the functional currency for the company's foreign subsidiaries. significant foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translation of those foreign currencies could adversely affect our business. additionally, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the euro, korean won and chinese renminbi, could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses' operations that could negatively affect our results of operations.
because we are a u.s. holding company, one significant source of our funds is distributions from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries' ability to convert local currency into u.s. dollars or to make payments outside the country. this could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption.
our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic, political, and market conditions.
maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. the automotive supply market in china is highly competitive, with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers. as the chinese market evolves, we anticipate that market participants will act aggressively to increase or maintain their market share. increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share. in addition, our business in china is sensitive to economic, political, social and market conditions that drive sales volumes in china. in fact, recently, economic growth has slowed in china. if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.
a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets.
changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds. if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade, our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted and our cost of borrowing or the interest rate for any subsequently issued debt would likely increase.
our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded. the interest costs on our revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in our credit agreement. further, an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing.
we could incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to execute actions in an effort to improve future profitability and competitiveness and to optimize our product portfolio and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits from these actions.
we have initiated and may continue to initiate restructuring actions designed to improve the competitiveness of our business and sustain our margin profile, optimize our product portfolio or create an optimal legal entity structure. we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. we are also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our actions. failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our actions could have an adverse effect on our business.
risks related to our customers we rely on sales to major customers.
we rely on sales to oems around the world of varying credit quality and manufacturing demands. supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the company. we base our growth projections, in part, on commitments made by our customers. these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle. among other things, the level of production orders we receive is dependent on the ability of our oem customers to design and sell products that consumers desire to purchase. if actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments due to a variety of factors including non-renewal of purchase orders, a customer's financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons, it could adversely affect our business.
some of our sales are concentrated. our worldwide sales in 2019 to ford and volkswagen constituted approximately 15% and 11% of our 2019 consolidated net sales, respectively.
we are sensitive to the effects of our major customers' labor relations.
all three of our primary north american customers, ford, fiat chrysler automobiles, and general motors, have major union contracts with the united automobile, aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america. because of domestic oems' dependence on a single union, we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at oems' facilities. similarly, a majority of our global customers' operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions. any extended work stoppage at one or more of our customers could have an adverse effect on our business.
risks related to our suppliers we could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers.
in an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services, we have been rationalizing our supply base. as a result, we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products. we select suppliers based on total value (including total landed price, quality, delivery, and technology), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition. we expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations.
however, there can be no assurance that capacity limitations, industry shortages, labor or social unrest, weather emergencies, commercial disputes, government actions, riots, wars, sabotage, cyber attacks, non-conforming parts, acts of terrorism, "acts of god," or other problems that our suppliers experience will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us. if we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations. in addition, with fewer sources of supply for certain components, each supplier may perceive that it has greater leverage and, therefore, some ability to seek higher prices from us at a time that we face substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of our products. this could adversely affect our customer relations and business.
suppliers' economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business.
rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes; our need to seek price reductions from our suppliers as a result of the substantial pressure we face from oems to reduce the prices of our products; credit tightness; changes in foreign currencies; raw material, commodity, tariffs, transportation, and energy price escalation; drastic changes in consumer preferences; and other factors could adversely affect our supply chain, and sometimes with little advance notice. these conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks. in certain instances, it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business. on occasion, we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines. we cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business.
we are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties.
we engage in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies, letters of credit, credit line agreements, financial derivatives, and investment management agreements involving various counterparties. we are subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to meet its obligations under such contracts.
other risks a variety of other factors could adversely affect our business.
any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business: the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers; start-up expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs; low levels of utilization of our manufacturing facilities, which can be dependent on a single product line or customer; inability to recover engineering and tooling costs; market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied; delays or difficulties in new product development; the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others; global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation; and the impact of fire, flood, or other natural disasters including pandemics and quarantines.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction borgwarner inc. and consolidated subsidiaries (the "company") is a global product leader in clean and efficient technology solutions for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles.  our products help improve vehicle performance, propulsion efficiency, stability and air quality. these products are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to original equipment manufacturers ("oems") of light vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles ("suvs"), vans and light trucks). the company's products are also sold to other oems of commercial vehicles (medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks and buses) and off-highway vehicles (agricultural and construction machinery and marine applications). we also manufacture and sell our products to certain tier one vehicle systems suppliers and into the aftermarket for light, commercial and off-highway vehicles. the company operates manufacturing facilities serving customers in europe, the americas and asia and is an original equipment supplier to every major automotive oem in the world.
the company's products fall into two reporting segments: engine and drivetrain. the engine segment's products include turbochargers, timing systems, emissions systems and thermal systems. the drivetrain segment's products include transmission systems, torque transfer systems and rotating electrical components.
proposed acquisition of delphi technologies plc on january 28, 2020, the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire delphi technologies plc ("delphi technologies") in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $3.3 billion, based on the closing price of borgwarner stock on january 27, 2020. refer to note 23, "subsequent event," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information. the company expects to pay fees, costs and expenses associated with the transaction with available cash. the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations does not address matters associated with the anticipated acquisition.
results of operations a detailed comparison of the company's 2017 operating results to its 2018 operating results can be found in the management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section in the company's 2018 annual report on form 10-k filed february 19, 2019.

cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 79.3% and 78.8% in the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the company's material cost of sales was approximately 55% of net sales in the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018. gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 20.7% and 21.2% in the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the reduction of gross margin in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the impact of lower revenue, the increased cost from tariffs and supplier cost reductions not keeping pace with normal customer price deflation.
selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") was $873 million and $946 million, or 8.6% and 9.0% of net sales for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the decrease in sg&a expenses was primarily due to stock-based compensation expense and cost control measures.
research and development ("r&d") costs, net of customer reimbursements, were $413 million, or 4.1% of net sales, in the year ended december 31, 2019, compared to $440 million, or 4.2% of net sales, in the year ended december 31, 2018. the decrease of r&d costs, net of customer reimbursements, in the year ended december 31, 2019 compared with the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily due to cost control measures and an increase in customer reimbursements. we will continue to invest in a number of cross-business r&d programs, as well as a number of other key programs, all of which are necessary for short- and long-term growth. our current long-term expectation for r&d spending remains in the range of 4% to 4.5% of net sales.
other (income) expense, net was $(75) million and $94 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. this line item is primarily comprised of non-income tax items discussed within the subtitle "non-comparable items impacting the company's earnings per diluted share and net earnings" above.
equity in affiliates' earnings, net of tax was $32 million and $49 million in the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. this line item is driven by the results of our 50%-owned japanese joint venture, nsk-warner kk, and our 32.6%-owned indian joint venture, turbo energy private limited ("tel"). the decrease in equity in affiliates' earnings in the year ended december 31, 2019 was due to lower industry volumes and cost pressures in a reduced market.
interest expense and finance charges were $55 million and $59 million in the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared with the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily due to lower debt levels.
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 37% for the year ended december 31, 2019, compared with the rate of 17.7% for the year ended december 31, 2018. as of december 31, 2018, the company has completed its accounting for the tax effects of the tax act. for further details, see note 5, "income tax," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8.
the effective tax rate of 37% for the year ended december 31, 2019 includes an increase in income tax expense of $173 million related to the derecognition of the morse tec asbestos-related deferred tax assets and $22 million due to the u.s. department of the treasury's issuance of the final regulations in the first quarter of 2019 related to the calculation of the one-time transition tax. this rate also includes reductions of income tax expense of $19 million related to restructuring expense, $11 million for a global realignment plan, $8 million related to other one-time adjustments and $6 million related to pension settlement loss. excluding the impact of these non-comparable items, the company's annual effective tax rate associated with ongoing operations is 26% for the year ended december 31, 2019.
the effective tax rate of 17.7% for the year ended december 31, 2018 includes reductions of income tax expense of $15 million related to restructuring expense, $6 million related to the asbestos-related adjustments, and $8 million related to asset impairment expense, offset by increases to tax expense of $1 million and $6 million related to a gain on commercial settlement and a gain on the sale of a building, respectively, discussed in note 4, "other (income) expense, net," to the consolidated financial statements.  the provision for income taxes also includes reductions of income tax expense of $13 million related to final adjustments made to measurement period provisional estimates associated with the tax act, $22 million related to a decrease in our deferred tax liability due to a tax benefit for certain foreign tax credits now available due to actions the company took during the year, $9 million related to valuation allowance releases, $3 million related to tax reserve adjustments, and $30 million related to changes in accounting methods and tax filing positions for prior years primarily related to the tax act. excluding the impact of these non-comparable items, the company's annual effective tax rate associated with ongoing operations for 2018 was 23.8%.
net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, net of tax of $51 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 decreased by $3 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. the decrease was due to lower industry volumes resulting in lower sales and earnings by the company's joint ventures.
results by reporting segment the company's business is comprised of two reporting segments: engine and drivetrain. these segments are strategic business groups, which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems.
the company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected after-tax return on invested capital ("roic") of its business initiatives. roic is comprised of adjusted ebit after deducting notional taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required. adjusted ebit is comprised of earnings before interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interest ("ebit") adjusted for restructuring, goodwill impairment charges, affiliates' earnings and other items not reflective of ongoing operating income or loss.
adjusted ebit is the measure of segment income or loss used by the company. the company believes adjusted ebit is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments.
the following tables show segment information and adjusted ebit for the company's reporting segments.

the engine segment's net sales for the year ended december 31, 2019 decreased $233 million, or 3.6%, and segment adjusted ebit decreased $45 million, or 4.3%, from the year ended december 31, 2018. excluding the impact of weakening foreign currencies, primarily the euro, chinese renminbi, and korean won, and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, net sales increased 1.3% from the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in sales was due to higher sales of light vehicle turbochargers and engine timing systems, which was partially offset by weaker commercial vehicle markets around the world. the segment adjusted ebit margin was 16.0% for the year ended december 31, 2019, compared to 16.1% in the year ended december 31, 2018.
the drivetrain segment's net sales for the year ended december 31, 2019 decreased $125 million, or 3.0%, and segment adjusted ebit decreased $32 million, or 6.7%, from the year ended december 31, 2018. excluding the impact of weakening foreign currencies, primarily the euro, chinese renminbi, and korean won, net sales were flat from the year ended december 31, 2018. the segment adjusted ebit margin was 11.0% in the year ended december 31, 2019, compared to 11.5% in the year ended december 31, 2018. the adjusted ebit margin decrease was primarily due to startup costs for launches.
corporate represents headquarters' expenses not directly attributable to the individual segments. this net expense was $206 million and $219 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the decrease in corporate expenses in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily due to lower costs associated with stock-based compensation and cost control initiatives.
outlook our overall outlook for 2020 is cautious. net new business-related sales growth, due to increased penetration of borgwarner products around the world, is expected to be partially offset by declining global industry production expected in 2020. the company expects flat to modestly declining revenue in 2020, excluding the impact of foreign currencies and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures.
the company maintains a positive long-term outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership strategy. the several trends that are driving the company's long-term growth are expected to continue, including the increased turbocharger adoption in north america and asia, the increased adoption of automated transmissions in asia-pacific, and increased global penetration of all-wheel drive. the company's long-term growth is also expected to benefit from the adoption of product offerings for hybrid and electric vehicles.
liquidity and capital resources the company maintains various liquidity sources including cash and cash equivalents and the unused portion of our multi-currency revolving credit agreement. at december 31, 2019, the company had $832 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which $562 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our subsidiaries outside of the united states. cash and cash equivalents held by these subsidiaries is used to fund foreign operational activities and future investments, including acquisitions.
the vast majority of cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states is available for repatriation. the tax act reduced the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. as of january 1, 2018, funds repatriated from foreign subsidiaries are generally no longer taxable for u.s. federal tax purposes. in light of the treatment of foreign earnings under the tax act, the company recorded a liability for the u.s. federal and applicable state income tax liabilities calculated under the provisions of the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. a deferred tax liability has been recorded for substantially all estimated legally distributable foreign earnings. the company uses its u.s. liquidity primarily for various corporate purposes, including but not limited to debt service, share repurchases, dividend distributions, acquisitions and divestitures and other corporate expenses.
the company has a $1.2 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility, which includes a feature that allows the company's facility to be increased to $1.5 billion with bank approval. the facility provides for borrowings through june 29, 2022. the company has one key financial covenant as part of the credit agreement which is a debt to ebitda ("earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization") ratio. the company was in compliance with the financial covenant at december 31, 2019 and expects to remain compliant in future periods. at december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, the company had no outstanding borrowings under this facility.
the company's commercial paper program allows the company to issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of $1.2 billion. under this program, the company may issue notes from time to time and use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. the company had no outstanding borrowings under this program as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018.
the total current combined borrowing capacity under the multi-currency revolving credit facility and commercial paper program cannot exceed $1.2 billion.
in addition to the credit facility, the company's universal shelf registration provides the ability to issue various debt and equity instruments subject to market conditions.
on february 6, 2019, april 25, 2019, july 25, 2019 and november 13, 2019, the company's board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.17 per share of common stock. these dividends were paid on march 15, 2019, june 17, 2019, september 16, 2019 and december 16, 2019.
from a credit quality perspective, the company had a credit rating of bbb+ from both standard & poor's and fitch ratings and baa1 from moody's as of december 31, 2019 with a stable outlook from all rating agencies. on january 28, 2020, the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire delphi technologies.  due to uncertainties surrounding this anticipated transaction, moody's adjusted their outlook to negative and standard & poor's placed the company on creditwatch with negative implications. the company's current outlook from fitch ratings remained stable. none of the company's debt agreements require accelerated repayment in the event of a downgrade in credit ratings.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $1,008 million and $1,126 million in the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the decrease for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared with the year ended december 31, 2018 primarily reflected the cash outflow related to the derecognition of a subsidiary, partially offset by changes in working capital.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $489 million and $514 million in the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the decrease in the year ended december 31, 2019 compared with the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures, including tooling outlays in 2019. year-over-year capital spending decrease of $65 million during the year ended december 31, 2019 was primarily due to timing of the investment activity in the engine segment.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $420 million and $383 million in the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the increase in the year ended december 31, 2019 compared with the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily driven by higher debt repayments, partially offset by lower share repurchases.

(a)   other postretirement employee benefits, excluding pensions, include anticipated future payments to cover retiree medical and life insurance benefits. amount contained in "after 2024" column includes estimated payments through 2029. refer to note 12, "retirement benefit plans," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for disclosures related to the company's other postretirement employee benefits.
(b)   since the timing and amount of payments for funded defined benefit pension plans are usually not certain for future years such potential payments are not shown in this table. amount contained in "after 2024" column is for unfunded plans and includes estimated payments through 2029. refer to note 12, "retirement benefit plans," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for disclosures related to the company's pension benefits.
we believe that the combination of cash from operations, cash balances, available credit facilities, and the universal shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations and our planned operations for the foreseeable future. we will continue to balance our needs for internal growth, external growth, debt reduction and cash conservation.
pension and other postretirement employee benefits the company's policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate. at december 31, 2019, all legal funding requirements had been met. the company contributed $26 million, $26 million and $18 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the company expects to contribute a total of $10 million to $20 million into its defined benefit pension plans during 2020. of the $10 million to $20 million in projected 2020 contributions, $4 million are contractually obligated, while any remaining payments would be discretionary.
the funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of $212 million and $211 million at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. of these amounts, $107 million and $95 million at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were related to plans in germany, where there is not a tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans; hence the common practice is to make contributions as benefit payments become due.
other postretirement employee benefits primarily consist of postretirement health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the company's u.s. operations. the company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred. other postretirement employee benefits had an unfunded status of $81 million and $87 million at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
the company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future.
refer to note 12, "retirement benefit plans," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits.
other matters contingencies in the normal course of business, the company is party to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and various other risks. it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. the company's environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below. the company's management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows, although it could be material to the results of operations in a particular quarter.
environmental the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties ("prps") at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act ("superfund") and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at 14 such sites. responsibility for clean-up and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula.
the company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.
refer to note 15, "contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further details and information respecting the company's environmental liability.
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap"). in preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations. some of these policies require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes. management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. our most critical accounting policies are discussed below.
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of control of our products. although the company may enter into long-term supply arrangements with its major customers, the prices and volumes are not fixed over the life of the arrangements, and a contract does not exist for purposes of applying accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 606 until volumes are contractually known. for most of our products, transfer of control occurs upon shipment or delivery;
however, a limited number of our customer arrangements for our highly customized products with no alternative use provide us with the right to payment during the production process. as a result, for these limited arrangements, revenue is recognized as goods are produced and control transfers to the customer. revenue is measured at the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring the good.
the company continually seeks business development opportunities and at times provides customer incentives for new program awards. customer incentive payments are capitalized when the payments are incremental and incurred only if the new business is obtained and these amounts are expected to be recovered from the customer over the term of the new business arrangement. the company recognizes a reduction to revenue as products that the upfront payments are related to are transferred to the customer, based on the total amount of products expected to be sold over the term of the arrangement (generally 3 to 7 years). the company evaluates the amounts capitalized each period end for recoverability and expenses any amounts that are no longer expected to be recovered over the term of the business arrangement.
impairment of long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, whether held for use or disposal, including other amortizing intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review under asc topic 360. in assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. in assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management generally considers individual facilities the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent. a recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event. if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, management will perform a fair value analysis. management determines fair value under asc topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market, income or cost approach. if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations. significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include: (i) an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review; (ii) undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset; and (iii) fair valuation of the asset. events and conditions that could result in impairment in the value of our long-lived assets include changes in the industries in which we operate, particularly the impact of a downturn in the global economy, as well as competition and advances in technology, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, or other factors leading to reduction in expected long-term sales or profitability.
assets and liabilities held for sale the company classifies assets and liabilities (disposal groups) to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the disposal group; the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal groups; an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the disposal group have been initiated; the sale of the disposal group is probable, and transfer of the disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond the company's control extend the period of time required to sell the disposal group beyond one year; the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
the company initially measures a disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a disposal group until the date of sale. the company assesses the fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and reports any subsequent changes as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. additionally, depreciation is not recorded during the period in which the long-lived assets, included in the disposal group, are classified as held for sale.
upon determining that a disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the company reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group, if material, in the line items assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet.
refer to note 20, "assets and liabilities held for sale," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each year, the company qualitatively assesses its goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units. this qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances, such as macro economic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, relevant events and financial trends, that may impact a reporting unit's fair value. using this qualitative assessment, the company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value. if it is determined that it is not more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds the carrying value, or upon consideration of other factors, including recent acquisition, restructuring or divestiture activity or to refresh the fair values, the company performs a quantitative, "step one," goodwill impairment analysis. in addition, the company may test goodwill in between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
similar to goodwill, the company can elect to perform the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trade names) using a qualitative analysis, considering similar factors as outlined in the goodwill discussion in order to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the trade names is less than the respective carrying values. if the company elects to perform or is required to perform a quantitative analysis, the test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. the company estimates the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief-from-royalty method, which it believes is an appropriate and widely used valuation technique for such assets. the fair value derived from the relief-from-royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trade names and not being required to pay a royalty for their use.
during the fourth quarter of 2019, the company performed an analysis on each reporting unit. based on the factors above, the company elected to perform quantitative, "step one," goodwill impairment analyses, on three reporting units. this requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. the basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the company's annual budget and long-range plan ("lrp"). the annual budget and lrp includes a five-year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the lrp data is a fair indication of the future performance. because the lrp is estimated over a significant future period of time, those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. further, the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the company's facts and circumstances.
the company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair value are reasonable. different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value. the primary assumptions affecting the company's december 31, 2019 goodwill quantitative, "step one," impairment review are as follows:
•   discount rate: the company used a 10.7% weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") as the discount rate for future cash flows. the wacc is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant.
•   operating income margin: the company used historical and expected operating income margins, which may vary based on the projections of the reporting unit being evaluated.
•   revenue growth rate: the company used a global automotive market industry growth rate forecast adjusted to estimate its own market participation for product lines.
in addition to the above primary assumptions, the company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models:
•   the automotive industry is cyclical, and the company's results of operations would be adversely affected by industry downturns.
•   the company is dependent on market segments that use our key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments.
•   the company is subject to risks related to international operations.
based on the assumptions outlined above, the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2019 indicated the company's goodwill assigned to the reporting units that were quantitatively assessed were not impaired and contained fair values substantially higher than the reporting units' carrying values. additionally, for the reporting units quantitatively assessed, sensitivity analyses were completed indicating that a one percentage point increase in the discount rate, a one percentage point decrease in the operating margin, or a one percentage point decrease in the revenue growth rate assumptions would not result in the carrying value exceeding the fair value.
refer to note 7, "goodwill and other intangibles," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding goodwill.
product warranties the company provides warranties on some, but not all, of its products. the warranty terms are typically from one to three years. provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. these estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties. management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual:

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change (as a percentage of net sales) in the assumed warranty trend on the company's accrued warranty liability:

25 basis point increase (income)/expense   $                 $
at december 31, 2019, the total accrued warranty liability was $116 million. the accrual is represented as $63 million in current liabilities and $53 million in non-current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.

asbestos like many other industrial companies that have historically operated in the united states, the company, or parties that the company is obligated to indemnify, has been named as one of many defendants in asbestos-related personal injury actions. morse tec, a former wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, was the obligor for the company's recorded asbestos-related liabilities and the policyholder of the related insurance assets. on october 30, 2019, the company transferred 100% of its equity interests to enstar holdings (us) llc. in the fourth quarter of 2019, the company derecognized morse tec and removed asbestos obligations, related insurance assets and associated deferred tax assets from the consolidated balance sheet.
with the assistance of a third-party actuary, the company estimated the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims not yet asserted to extend through december 31, 2064 with a runoff through 2074 and defense costs. this estimate was based on the company's historical claim experience and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed based on anticipated levels of unique plaintiff asbestos-related claims in the u.s. tort system against all defendants. as with any estimates, actual experience may differ. this estimate was not discounted to present value. the company believed that december 31, 2074 was a reasonable assumption as to the last date on which it was likely to have resolved all asbestos-related claims, based on the nature and useful life of the company's products and the likelihood of incidence of asbestos-related disease in the u.s. population generally. the company assessed the sufficiency of its estimated liability for pending and future claims not yet asserted and defense costs by evaluating actual experience regarding claims filed, settled and dismissed, and amounts paid in claim resolution costs. in addition to claims experience, the company considered additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as changes in legislation, the legal environment, and the company's defense strategy. the company continued to have additional excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestos-related claims.  in connection with the company's review of its asbestos-related claims, the company also reviewed the amount of its potential insurance coverage for such claims, taking into account the remaining limits of such coverage, the number and amount of claims on the company's insurance from co-insured parties, ongoing litigation against the company's insurance carriers, potential remaining recoveries from insolvent insurance carriers, the impact of previous insurance settlements, and coverage available from solvent insurance carriers not party to the coverage litigation.
refer to note 15, "contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding management's judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestos-related assets and liabilities.
pension and other postretirement defined benefits the company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees. costs associated with postretirement defined benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees, retirees and surviving spouses and dependents.
the company's defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 715. the determination of the company's obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits, such as retiree health care, is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in note 12, "retirement benefit plans," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report. the effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap.
in accordance with gaap, actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods. the primary assumptions affecting the company's accounting for employee benefits under asc topics 712 and 715 as of december 31, 2019 are as follows:
•   expected long-term rate of return on plan assets: the expected long-term rate of return is used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost. the required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. over time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned long-term returns. the expected long-term rate of return for pension assets has been determined based on various inputs, including historical returns for the different asset classes held by the company's trusts and its asset allocation, as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding expected capital market return, inflation and other variables. the company also considers the impact of active management of the plans' invested assets. in determining its pension expense for the year ended december 31, 2019, the company used long-term rates of return on plan assets ranging from 1.75% to 5.9% outside of the u.s. and 6.0% in the u.s.
actual returns on u.s. pension assets were 18.0% and -4.1% for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 6.0% for the same years ended.
actual returns on u.k. pension assets were 9.5% and -3.1% for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 5% for the year ended december 31, 2019 and 6% for the year ended in 2018.
actual returns on german pension assets were 21.0% and -4.2% for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 5.9% for the same years ended.
•   discount rate: the discount rate is used to calculate pension and other postretirement employee benefit ("opeb") obligations. in determining the discount rate, the company utilizes a full-yield approach in the estimation of service and interest components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. the company used discount rates ranging from 0.74% to 9.0% to determine its pension and other benefit obligations as of december 31, 2019, including weighted average discount rates of 3.17% in the u.s., 1.61% outside of the u.s., and 2.95% for u.s. other postretirement health care plans. the u.s. discount rate reflects the fact that our u.s. pension plan has been closed for new participants since 1989 (1999 for our u.s. health care plan).
•   health care cost trend: for postretirement employee health care plan accounting, the company reviews external data and company-specific historical trends for health care cost to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions. in determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of december 31, 2019, the company used health care cost trend rates of 6.25%, declining to an ultimate trend rate of 5% by the year 2025.
while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the company's pension and opeb and its future expense.
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for company sponsored u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans on its 2020 pre-tax pension expense:

one percentage point increase in expected return on assets   $2                                                              $5
________________
* a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a negligible impact on the company's u.s. 2020 pre-tax pension expense.
the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company's total 2020 u.s. opeb expense is expected to be negligible, as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains.
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the company's opeb obligation and service and interest cost:

restructuring restructuring costs may occur when the company takes action to exit or significantly curtail a part of its operations or implements a reorganization that affects the nature and focus of operations. a restructuring charge can consist of severance costs associated with reductions to the workforce, costs to terminate an operating lease or contract, professional fees and other costs incurred related to the implementation of restructuring activities.
the company generally records costs associated with voluntary separations at the time of employee acceptance. costs for involuntary separation programs are recorded when management has approved the plan for separation, the employees are identified and aware of the benefits they are entitled to and it is unlikely that the plan will change significantly. when a plan of separation requires approval by or consultation with the relevant labor organization or government, the costs are recorded upon agreement. costs associated with benefits that are contingent on the employee continuing to provide service are accrued over the required service period.
income taxes  the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
accounting for income taxes is complex, in part because the company conducts business globally and therefore files income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions. management judgment is required in determining the company's worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities, including accruals for unrecognized tax benefits. in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period. in determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information. since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the company's valuation allowance may be necessary.
the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. at the federal and state level and numerous non-u.s. jurisdictions. the determination of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits includes the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions across the company's global operations. management judgment is required in determining the accruals for unrecognized tax benefits. in the ordinary course of the company's business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are established when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. the company has certain u.s. state income tax returns and certain non-u.s. income tax returns which are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities. at december 31, 2019, the company has a liability for tax positions the company estimates are not more-likely-than-not to be sustained based on the technical merits, which is included in other current and non-current liabilities. nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.
the tax act that was signed into law in december 2017 constitutes a major change to the u.s. tax system. the impact of the tax act on the company is based on management's current interpretations of the tax act, recently issued regulations and related analysis. the company's tax liability may be materially different based on regulatory developments. in future periods, our effective tax rate could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of regulatory developments related to the tax act.

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations. some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers. other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies, which include forward contracts. the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses. we do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks.
we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk, which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk. for quantitative disclosures about market risk, refer to note 11, "financial instruments," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity purchase price risk.
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to optimize its interest costs. the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates (fair value hedges). at december 31, 2019, all of the company's debt had fixed interest rates.
foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. currently, our most significant currency exposures relate to the chinese renminbi, the euro, the hungarian forint, the japanese yen, the mexican peso, the swedish krona and the south korean won. we mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve, by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans. such non-u.s. dollar debt was $41 million and $47 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. we also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. the depreciation of the british pound following the united kingdom's 2016 vote to leave the european union has not and is not expected to have a significant impact on the company since net sales from the united kingdom represent less than 2% of the company's net sales in 2019. in addition, the company periodically enters into forward currency contracts to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. as of december 31, 2018, the company recorded a deferred gain of $2 million and a deferred loss of $2 million related to foreign currency derivatives. as of december 31, 2019, deferred gains and losses related to foreign currency derivatives were immaterial.
the foreign currency translation adjustment loss of $55 million and foreign currency translation adjustment loss of $148 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, contained within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income represent the foreign currency translational impacts of converting our non-u.s. dollar subsidiaries' financial statements to the company's reporting currency (u.s. dollar) and the related gains and losses arising from our net investment hedges. the 2019 foreign currency translation adjustment loss was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening u.s. dollar against the euro, chinese renminbi and swedish krona, which which increased approximately 2%, 1% and 6% and increased other comprehensive loss by approximately $18 million, $17 million and $15 million, respectively. the 2018 foreign currency translation adjustment loss was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening u.s. dollar against the euro and chinese renminbi, which increased approximately 4% and 5% and increased other comprehensive loss by approximately $58 million and $48 million, respectively. in addition, the company periodically enters into foreign currency contracts, cross-currency swaps, and foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges to reduce exposure to translational exchange rate risk. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, the company recorded a deferred gain of $4 million and a deferred loss of $14 million, respectively, for net investment hedges.
commodity price risk commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products. commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to potential change in prices mainly for various non-ferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, the company had outstanding commodity swap contracts with total notional values of $1 million and $2 million, respectively. the related fair value of these swaps were immaterial.
disclosure regarding forward-looking statements the matters discussed in this item 7 include forward looking statements. see "forward looking statements" at the beginning of this annual report on form 10-k.

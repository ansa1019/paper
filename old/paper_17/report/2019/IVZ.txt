item 1a.  risk factors volatility and disruption in world capital and credit markets, as well as adverse changes in the global economy, can negatively affect invesco's revenues, operations, financial condition and liquidity.
in recent years, capital and credit markets have experienced substantial volatility. in this regard:
•   in the event of extreme circumstances, including economic, political, or business crises, such as a widespread systemic failure or disruptions in the global financial system or failures of firms that have significant obligations as counterparties on financial instruments, we may suffer significant declines in aum and severe liquidity or valuation problems in managed investment products in which client and company assets are invested, all of which would adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, liquidity, credit ratings, ability to access capital markets, and ability to retain and attract key employees. additionally, these factors could impact our ability to realize the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.
•   illiquidity and/or volatility of the global fixed income and/or equity markets could negatively affect our ability to manage client inflows and outflows or to timely meet client redemption requests.
•   uncertainties regarding geopolitical developments can produce volatility in global financial markets. as an example, although negotiations between the uk and eu resulted in the uk leaving the eu under the terms of the withdrawal agreement on january 31, 2020, the longer term relationship between the uk and the eu is still uncertain. this may impact the levels and composition of our aum and also negatively impact investor sentiment, which could result in reduced or negative flows. in addition, because the uk pound sterling is the functional currency for certain of our subsidiaries, any weakening of the uk pound sterling relative to the u.s. dollar could negatively impact our reported financial results.
•   changes to united states tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business. currently, there is significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united states and other countries, including china and the eu, with respect to trade policies, treaties, taxes, government regulations and tariffs. it is unclear what changes may be considered or implemented and what the response will be to any such changes by other governments of such affected countries. these developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between these nations and the united states. given our strong position in asia pacific and emea, we could be more adversely affected than others by such market uncertainties.
•   in the u.s., regulations requiring a variable ("floating") net asset value (nav) for institutional prime and tax-free money market funds became effective in october 2016. those same regulations also provide for the potential imposition of the assessment of fees in connection with redemptions and/or gates that postpone the time in which redemptions must be processed in the event those funds' weekly liquid assets fall below certain specified thresholds. our government money market funds and retail prime and tax-free money market funds continue to offer a stable nav of $1.00 per common share and are not required to impose fees and gates; however, we do not guarantee such nav level. market conditions could lead to severe liquidity issues in money market products, which could lead to the imposition of fees or gates with respect to institutional prime and tax-free money market funds and an effect on the navs of government and retail prime and tax-free money market funds. if our institutional prime or tax-free money market funds were to impose redemption fees or gates delaying the payment of redemption proceeds, or the nav of one of our government or retail prime or tax-free money market funds were to decline below $1.00 per common share, such funds could experience significant redemptions in aum, loss of shareholder confidence and reputational harm.
our revenues and profitability would be adversely affected by any reduction in aum as a result of either a decline in market value of such assets or net outflows, which would reduce the investment management fees we earn.
we derive substantially all our revenues from investment management contracts with clients. under these contracts, the investment management fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of aum. aum may decline for various reasons. for any period in which revenues decline, our income and operating margin likely would decline by a greater proportion because a majority of our expenses remain fixed. factors that could decrease aum (and therefore revenues) include the following:
declines in the market value of aum in client portfolios. these could be caused by price declines in the securities markets generally or by price declines in the market segments in which our aum are concentrated. our aum as of january 31, 2020 were $1,218.7 billion. we cannot predict whether volatility in the markets will result in substantial or sustained declines in the securities markets generally or result in price declines in market segments in which our aum are concentrated. any of the foregoing could negatively impact our revenues, income and operating margin.
redemptions and other withdrawals from, or shifting among, client portfolios. these could be caused by investors (in response to adverse market conditions or pursuit of other investment opportunities) reducing their investments in client portfolios in general or in the market segments in which invesco focuses; investors taking profits from their investments; poor investment performance (relative or absolute) of the client portfolios managed by invesco; and portfolio risk characteristics, which could cause investors to move assets to other investment managers. poor performance relative to other investment management firms tends to result in decreased sales and increased redemptions with corresponding decreases in our revenues. failure of our client portfolios to perform well could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on us. furthermore, the fees we earn vary with the types of assets being managed, with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts, along with real estate and other alternative asset products, and lower fees earned on fixed income, stable return accounts, and certain etfs. our revenues may decline if clients continue to shift their investments to lower fee accounts. in addition, the loss of key personnel or significant investment management professionals could reduce the attractiveness of our products to current and potential clients and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
investments in international markets. investment products that we manage may have significant investments in international markets that are subject to significant risks of loss from political, economic, diplomatic developments, currency fluctuations, social instability, changes in governmental policies, expropriation, nationalization and asset confiscation. international trading markets, particularly emerging markets, are often smaller, less liquid, less regulated and significantly more volatile than those in the developed world.
poor investment performance of our products could reduce the level of our aum or affect our sales, and negatively impact our revenues and income.
our investment performance, along with achieving and maintaining appropriate levels of distribution and client service, is critical to the success of our business. strong investment performance often stimulates sales of our products. poor investment performance as compared to third-party benchmarks or competitive products has in the past led, and could in the future lead, to a decrease in sales of our products and stimulate redemptions from existing products, generally lowering the overall level of aum and reducing the management fees we earn. there is no assurance that past or present investment performance in our products will be indicative of future performance. if we fail, or appear to fail, to address successfully and promptly the underlying causes of any poor investment performance, we may be unsuccessful in reversing such under performance and our future business prospects would likely be negatively affected.
competitive pressures may force us to reduce the fees we charge to clients, which could reduce our profitability.
the investment management business is highly competitive, and we compete based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, the range of products offered, brand recognition, business reputation, financial strength, stability and continuity of client and financial intermediary relationships, quality of service, level of fees charged for services and the level of compensation paid and distribution support offered to financial intermediaries. we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in many products. investors remain attracted to lower fee passive products, which have gained and may continue to gain share at the expense of active products.
we face strong competition in every market in which we operate. our competitors include a large number of investment management firms, commercial banks, investment banks, broker-dealers, hedge funds, insurance companies and other financial institutions. some of these institutions have greater capital and other resources, and offer more comprehensive lines of products and services, than we do. our competitors seek to expand their market share in many of the products and services we offer. if these competitors are successful, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. in addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry by new investment management firms, and the successful efforts of new entrants around the world have also resulted in increased competition.
in recent years there have been several instances of industry consolidation, both in the area of distributors and manufacturers of investment products. further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future. the increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future.
we may not adjust our expenses quickly enough to match significant declines in our revenues.
if we are unable to effect appropriate expense reductions in a timely manner in response to declines in our revenues, or if we are otherwise unable to adapt to rapid changes in the global marketplace or our aum and revenues, our profitability, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
our revenues and profitability from money market and other fixed income assets may be harmed by interest rate, liquidity and credit volatility.
certain institutional investors using money market products and other short-term duration fixed income products for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other fund products holding lower yielding instruments. these redemptions would reduce managed assets, thereby reducing our revenues. in addition, rising interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of fixed income investments and fixed income derivatives held in various investment portfolios and other products. thus, increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our revenues from certain fixed income products. if securities within a money market portfolio default or investor redemptions force the portfolio to realize losses, there could be negative pressure on its nav. although money market investments are not guaranteed instruments, the company might decide, under such a scenario, that it is in its best interest to provide support in the form of a support agreement, capital infusion, or other methods to help stabilize a declining nav. some of these methods could have an adverse impact on our profitability. additionally, we have investments in fixed income assets, including collateralized loan obligations and seed money in fixed income funds, the valuation of which could change with changes in interest and default rates.
the manner in which interest rates are calculated could also impact our client portfolios. for example, libor, as well as other interest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be "benchmarks," are the subject of ongoing international, national and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform.  some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented. the u.s. federal reserve, based on the recommendations of the new york federal reserve's alternative reference rate committee (consisting of major derivative market participants and their regulators), has begun publishing a secured overnight funding rate (sofr) which is intended to replace u.s. dollar libor, and sofr-based investment products have been issued in the u.s. proposals for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced or have already begun publication. markets are slowly developing in response to these new rates and questions around liquidity in these rates and how to appropriately adjust these rates to eliminate any economic value transfer at the time of transition remain a significant concern for us and others in the marketplace. it is difficult to predict the full impact of the transition away from libor on certain derivatives and floating rate securities we hold and any other assets or liabilities (as well as contractual rights and obligations) whose value is tied to libor. the value or profitability of these products and instruments, and our costs of operations, may be adversely affected until new reference rates and fallbacks for both legacy and new products, instruments and contracts are commercially accepted.
we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks.
we regularly review, and from time-to-time have discussions with and engage in, potential strategic transactions, including potential acquisitions, dispositions, consolidations, joint ventures or similar transactions, some of which may be material. there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices, have sufficient capital resources to pursue such transactions, be successful in negotiating the required agreements, or successfully close transactions after signing such agreements.
acquisitions also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations. we could also experience financial or other setbacks if pending transactions encounter unanticipated problems, including problems related to closing or integration. following the completion of an acquisition, we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support, including financial reporting and internal controls, to the acquired business for a period of time. there can be no assurance that such sellers will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us.
we have incurred and will continue to incur transaction and integration costs in connection with the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds and the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not offset these costs.
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with the acquisition and integration of oppenheimerfunds. there can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the business will be realized to offset these transaction and integration costs over time. as part of the integration activities for the oppenheimerfunds business, the company has identified a matter that involves a possible loss contingency related to the operations of the acquired business.  see part ii, see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 19, "commitments and contingencies" for additional information.
in connection with the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds, we issued perpetual preferred stock having a value of approximately $4 billion, which could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and may limit our ability to fund other priorities.
in connection with the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds, invesco issued approximately $4 billion of 5.9% fixed rate perpetual preferred stock to certain of oppenheimerfunds' former shareholders. this issuance may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of common shares in certain circumstances; may increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; and will require a significant portion of cash flow from operations to make required dividend payments to preferred shareholders.
in connection with the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds, we issued approximately 81.9 million common shares, which could adversely impact our trading price upon resale of those common shares.
we issued approximately 81.9 million common shares in connection with the acquisition, most of which are held by massachusetts mutual life insurance company (massmutual). the common shares held by massmutual are subject to an agreement not to sell those common shares for a period of two years following completion of the acquisition, subject to early termination, as well as to certain limitations on resales. however, massmutual may in the future sell these common shares in the open market or through secondary offerings. if massmutual were to sell its equity stake in invesco, or express an intention to sell the stake, that action could have a significant impact on our common share trading price.
massmutual has the ability to significantly influence our business and massmutual's interest in our business may be different from that of other shareholders.
massmutual is entitled to designate an individual to serve on our board so long as it beneficially owns at least (i) 10% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock or (ii) (x) 5% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and (y) $2.0 billion in aggregate liquidation preference of our series a preferred shares. additionally, we are not permitted to take certain actions without the prior written approval of massmutual, including making certain changes in our capital structure or our organizational documents, adopting a shareholder rights plan or effectuating certain business combination transactions. massmutual's level of ownership and influence may make some transactions (such as those involving mergers, material share issuances or changes in control) more difficult or impossible without the support of massmutual, which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of our common stock. the interests of massmutual may conflict with the interests of other shareholders.
we depend on information technology, and any failures of or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities, or those of third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could result in significant limits on our ability to conduct our operations and activities, costs and reputational damage.
we are highly dependent upon the use of various proprietary and third-party information and security technology, software applications and other technology systems to operate our business. we are also dependent on the effectiveness of our information and cyber security infrastructure, policies, procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. we use our technology to, among other things, manage and trade portfolio investments, support our other operations, obtain securities pricing information, process client transactions, protect the privacy of clients', employees' and business partners' data and provide reports and other customer services to the clients of the funds we manage. any inaccuracies, delays, systems failures or security breaches in these and other processes could disrupt our business operations, subject us to client, employee or business partner dissatisfaction and losses, subject us to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions and/or subject us to reputational harm.
our computer, communications, data processing, networks, backup, business continuity or other operating, information or technology systems and facilities, including those that we outsource to other providers, may fail to operate properly or become disabled, overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. further, third-party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to us regarding cyber-incidents.
in recent years, several financial services firms suffered cyber-attacks launched both domestically and from abroad, resulting in the disruption of services to clients, loss or misappropriation of confidential data, litigation and regulatory enforcement actions and reputational harm. cyber-security incidents and cyber-attacks have been occurring globally at a more frequent and severe level. our status as a global financial institution and the nature of our client base may enhance the risk that we are targeted by such cyber-threats. although we seek to take protective measures, including measures to effectively secure information through system security technology, and seek to continually monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, our technology systems may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other events that have a security impact, such as an external hacker attack by one or more cyber criminals or an authorized employee or vendor causing us to release confidential information inadvertently or through malfeasance, or lose temporarily or permanently data or applications or systems, which could materially harm our operations and reputation. the third parties with which we do business or which facilitate our business activities, including financial intermediaries and technology infrastructure and service providers, are also susceptible to the foregoing risks (including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely), and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be adversely affected, perhaps materially, by failures, terminations, errors or malfeasance by, or attacks or constraints on, one or more financial, technology or infrastructure institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business.
breach of our technology systems could damage our reputation and could result in the unauthorized disclosure or modification or loss of sensitive or confidential information (including client data); unauthorized disclosure, modification or loss of proprietary information relating to our business; inability to process client or company transactions and processes; breach and termination of client contracts; liability for stolen assets, information or identity; remediation costs to repair damage caused by the breach, including damage to systems and recovery of lost data; additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents; regulatory actions (including fines and penalties, which could be material) and litigation costs resulting from the incident. such consequences could result in material financial loss and have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability.
our investment management professionals and other key employees are a vital part of our ability to attract and retain clients, and the loss of key individuals or a significant portion of those professionals could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability.
retaining highly skilled investment management personnel is important to our ability to attract and retain our clients. the market for skilled investment management professionals is highly competitive. the market for investment professionals and other key personnel is at times characterized by the movement of these professionals among different firms. our policy has been to provide our investment management professionals and other key personnel with a supportive professional working environment and compensation and benefits (including equity and other forms of deferred compensation) that we believe are competitive with other leading investment management firms. however, we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel, and the loss of significant investment professionals or other key personnel could reduce the attractiveness of our products to potential and current clients and could, therefore, adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our net revenues and hinder our growth.
we sell substantially all of our retail investment products through a variety of third party financial intermediaries, including major wire houses, fund supermarkets, regional broker-dealers, insurance companies, banks and financial planners in north america, and independent brokers and financial advisors, banks and supermarket platforms in europe and asia. no single one of these intermediaries is material to our business. increasing competition for these distribution channels could nevertheless cause our distribution costs to rise, which would lower our net revenues. following the financial crisis, there has been consolidation of banks and broker-dealers, particularly in the u.s., and a limited amount of migration of brokers and financial advisors away from major banks to independent firms focused largely on providing advice. if these changes continue, our distribution costs could increase as a percentage of our revenues generated. additionally, particularly outside of the u.s., certain of the third party intermediaries upon whom we rely to distribute our investment products also sell their own competing proprietary funds and investment products, which could limit the distribution of our products. investors, particularly in the institutional market, rely on external consultants and other third parties for advice on the choice of investment manager. these consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence over their clients' choices, and they may favor a competitor of invesco as better meeting their particular clients' needs. there is no assurance that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future. similarly, particularly in the united states, certain distributors have substantially reduced the number of investment funds they make available to their customers. if a material portion of our distributors were to substantially narrow their product offerings, it could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. more broadly, in both retail and institutional channels, intermediaries (distribution firms and consultants) are seeking to reduce the number of investment management firms they do business with. while this offers opportunities to the company to have broader and deeper relationships with firms that continue to do business with us, it also poses risks of additional lost business if a particular entity chooses to stop or significantly reduce its business relationship with the company. any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these distribution sources and the consultant community do to any of the above-described factors would impair our ability to sell our products, which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability.
we may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose us to additional costs or operational risk.
our financial performance depends, in part, on the company's ability to develop, market and manage new investment products and services. the development and introduction of new products and services requires continued innovative efforts on our part and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements. new products often must be in the market place for three or more years in order to generate track records required to attract significant aum inflows. increasingly clients and intermediaries are looking to investment mangers to be able to deliver investment outcomes tailored to particular circumstances and needs, and to augment traditional investment management products and services with additional value-added services. the company has sought to make investment designed to enable it to meet these evolving expectation, which the company believes it will need to meet in in order to maintain and grow its business. a failure to continue to innovate to introduce successful new products and services or to manage effectively the risks associated with such products and services may impact our market share relevance and may cause our aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
our financial condition and liquidity would be adversely affected by losses on our seed capital and co-investments.
the company has investments in managed investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including, but not limited to equities, fixed income products, commodities, derivatives, and similar financial instruments, private equity and real estate. investments in these products are generally made to establish a track record, meet purchase size requirements for trading blocks, or demonstrate economic alignment with other investors in our funds. adverse market conditions may result in the need to write down the value of these seed capital and co-investments. a reduction in the value of these investments may adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity. as of december 31, 2019, the company had approximately $1,074.4 million in seed capital and co-investments, including direct investments in consolidated investment products (cip).
failure to comply with client contractual requirements and/or investment guidelines could result in costs or correction, damage awards or regulatory fines and penalties against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations.
many of the investment management agreements under which we manage assets or provide products or services specify investment guidelines or requirements, such as adherence to investment restrictions or limits, that we are required to observe in the provision of our services. laws and regulations impose similar requirements for certain client portfolios (such as registered funds). a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could result in damage to our reputation or in our clients seeking to recover losses, withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts. regulators likewise may commence enforcement actions for violations of such requirements, which could lead to fines and penalties against the company. any such effects could cause our revenues and profitability to decline. we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to seek to prevent, detect and correct such errors. when an error is detected, a payment will typically be made into the applicable client account to correct it. significant errors for which we are responsible could impact our reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
our investment advisory agreements are subject to termination or non-renewal, and our fund and other investors may withdraw their assets at any time.
substantially all our revenues are derived from investment management agreements. investment management agreements are generally terminable upon 30 or fewer days' notice. agreements with u.s. registered funds may be terminated with notice, or terminated in the event of an "assignment" (as defined in the investment company act of 1940, as amended), and must be renewed annually by the disinterested members of each fund's board of trustees or directors, as required by law. in addition, the boards of trustees or directors of certain other fund accounts generally may terminate these investment management agreements upon written notice for any reason. open-end registered fund and unit trust investors may generally withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice. institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationships with us or reduce the aggregate amount of aum, generally on short notice. any termination of or failure to renew a significant number of these agreements, or any other loss of a significant number of our clients or aum, would adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
if our reputation is harmed, we could suffer losses in our business, revenues and net income.
our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients, regulators and other market participants, and our good reputation is critical to our business. our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate. regulatory inquiries, investigations or findings of wrongdoing, intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of our products and services in advertising materials, public relations information, social media or other external communications, operational failures (including cyber breaches), employee dishonesty or other misconduct and rumors, among other things, can substantially damage our reputation, even if they are baseless or eventually satisfactorily addressed.
our business also requires us to continuously manage actual and potential conflicts of interest, including situations where our services to a particular client conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of other clients or those of invesco. the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail - or appear to fail - to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. in addition, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions.
we have procedures and controls that are designed to address and manage these risks, but this task can be complex and difficult, and if our procedures and controls fail, our reputation could be damaged. any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel, and lead to a reduction in the amount of our aum, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
the failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may have a negative impact on similar invesco products irrespective of our performance.
many competitors offer similar products to those offered by us and the failure or negative performance of competitors' products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar invesco products, irrespective of the performance of our products. any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us or the client portfolios we manage.
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. we, and the client portfolios that we manage, have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, clearing organizations, hedge funds and other institutions. many of these transactions expose us or such client portfolios to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty. while we regularly conduct assessments of such risk posed by counterparties, the risk of non-performance by such parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets. such non-performance could produce a financial loss for the company or the client portfolios we manage.
our ability to maintain our credit ratings and to access the capital markets in a timely manner should we seek to do so depends on a number of factors.
our access to the capital markets depends significantly on our credit ratings. we have received credit ratings of a2/stable, bbb+/stable and a-/positive from moody's investor services ("moody's"), standard & poor's ratings service ("s&p"), and fitch ratings ("fitch"), respectively, as of the date hereof. we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to the fact that our revenues are exposed to equity market volatility and the potential impact from regulatory changes to the industry. additionally, the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire investment management industry, based on their perspective of future growth and solvency. material deterioration of these factors, and others defined by each rating agency, could result in downgrades to our credit ratings, thereby limiting our ability to access additional financing. management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings.
our credit facility borrowing rates are tied to our credit ratings. a reduction in our long-term credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs, could limit our access to the capital markets and may result in outflows thereby reducing aum and revenues. volatility in global finance markets may also affect our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so. if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely affected.
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.
as of december 31, 2019, we had outstanding total debt of $2,080.3 million, excluding debt of cip, and total equity attributable to invesco ltd. of $13,862.5 million. the amount of indebtedness we carry could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other purposes, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or industry and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors. any or all of the above factors could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.
our credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to conduct business and, if amounts borrowed under it were subject to accelerated repayment, we might not have sufficient assets or liquidity to repay such amounts in full.
our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios, including maximum debt-to-earnings and minimum interest coverage ratios. the credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict certain of our subsidiaries' ability to incur debt and restrict our ability to transfer assets, merge, make loans and other investments and create liens. the breach of any covenant would result in a default under the credit facility. in the event of any such default, lenders that are party to the credit facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and require all amounts borrowed under the credit facility, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. if any indebtedness under the credit facility were subject to accelerated repayment and if we had at that time a significant amount of outstanding debt under the credit facility, we might not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full.
performance fees may increase revenue and earnings volatility.
a portion of the company's revenues is derived from performance fees on investment advisory agreements. performance fees represented $102.2 million, or 1.7%, of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019. in most cases, performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns, although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards. generally, the company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. if these targets are not exceeded, performance fees for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the company may not earn performance fees in future periods. performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition, causing our earnings to be more volatile.
distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries may be subject to limitations, including net capital requirements.
substantially all our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. as a result, our cash flow and our ability to fund operations are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of earnings, intercompany loans or other payments by our subsidiaries to us. any payments to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions and are contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings and business considerations. for example, certain of our subsidiaries are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain appropriate levels of capital. such requirements may change from time-to-time as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors, including balance sheet composition, assessment of risk exposures and governance and review from regulators. these and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital, repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities. all of our regulated eu and uk subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under applicable eu and uk requirements, including those arising from the eu's capital requirements directive and the uk's internal capital adequacy assessment process (icaap), and capital is maintained within this european sub-group to satisfy these regulations. we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash equivalents. this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european sub-group in the countries where it is located. due to the capital restrictions, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. in addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences. as of december 31, 2019, the company's minimum regulatory capital requirement was $753.6 million. complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european sub-group. as a result of corporate restructuring and regulatory requirements, certain of these subsidiaries may be required to limit their dividends to the ultimate parent company, invesco ltd. our financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected if certain of our subsidiaries are unable to distribute funds to us.
we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations.
we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states. we have offices in numerous countries and sponsor many cross border and local proprietary funds that are domiciled outside the united states and may face difficulties in managing, operating and marketing our international operations. our international operations expose us to the political and economic consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions and subject us to expropriation risks, expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences.
since many of our subsidiary operations are located outside of the united states and have functional currencies other than the u.s. dollar, changes in the exchange rates to the u.s. dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next.
the largest component of our net assets, revenues and expenses, as well as our aum, is presently denominated in u.s. dollars. however, we have a large number of subsidiaries outside of the united states whose functional currencies are not the u.s. dollar. as a result, fluctuations in the exchange rates to the u.s. dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next. consequently, significant strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to the uk pound sterling, euro, or japanese yen, among other currencies, could have a material negative impact on our reported financial results.
terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism, increased geopolitical unrest, natural or man-made disasters could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional and domestic markets, which may cause our aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism, acts of civil or international unrest or hostility, natural disasters, pandemic disease and man-made disasters, within the united states and abroad, as well as ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets and reduced economic activity. (for example, the spread of a new strain of coronavirus at the end of 2019 may impact global markets in asia. the market reaction may deepen further if the virus spreads.) any of these events that adversely affect the global economy, capital markets or specific international, regional or domestic markets may cause our aum, revenue and earnings to decline and may have a materially negative impact on our financial results.
if we are unable to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem, we could suffer material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.
if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as a pandemic or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. in such an event, we believe our operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing back-up systems should mitigate adverse impacts. nevertheless, we could still experience near-term operational problems with regard to particular areas of our operations. further, as we strive to achieve cost savings by shifting certain business processes to lower-cost geographic locations such as india, the potential for particular types of natural or man-made disasters, political, economic or infrastructure instabilities, or other country- or region-specific business continuity risks increases. although we seek to assess regularly and improve our existing business continuity plans, a major disaster, or one that affected certain important operating areas, or our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.
failure to establish adequate controls and risk management policies, the circumvention of controls and policies or fraud could have an adverse effect on our reputation and financial position.
although we seek to foster a positive workplace culture, have adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continue to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks, we cannot ensure that our workplace culture or such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to our business. we are subject to the risk that our employees, contractors or other third parties may deliberately or recklessly seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud (including through cyber breaches) or act in ways that are inconsistent with our controls, policies and procedures. persistent or repeated attempts involving conflicts of interests, circumvention of policies and controls or fraud could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, could lead to costly regulatory inquiries, fines and/or sanctions and may cause our aum, revenue and earning to decline.
our business is vulnerable to deficiencies and failures in support systems and customer service functions that could lead to breaches and errors or reputational harm, resulting in loss of customers or claims against us or our subsidiaries.
in addition to investment management, our services include fund administration, sales, distribution, marketing, shareholder servicing and trust, custody and other fiduciary services. in order to be competitive and comply with our agreements, we must properly perform our fund and portfolio administration and related responsibilities, including portfolio recordkeeping and accounting, security pricing, corporate actions, investment restrictions compliance, daily net asset value computations, account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders. the ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information, process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and clients in accounts managed by us is essential to our continuing success. certain types of securities may experience liquidity constraints that would require increased use of fair value pricing, which is dependent on certain subjective judgments that have the potential to be challenged. any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information, processing such transactions or such reports or other breaches and errors and any inadequacies in other customer service, could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities, or alienate clients or distributors and potentially give rise to claims against us. our customer service capability, as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports, is highly dependent on communications and information systems and on third-party service providers. certain of these processes involve a degree of manual input, and thus problems could occur from time-to-time due to human error. our failure to properly perform and monitor our operations or our otherwise suffering deficiencies and failures in these systems or service functions could result in material financial loss or costs, regulatory actions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal claims and liability, which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability.
the failure of one of our third party service providers or other key vendors to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or business, which may cause our aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
we depend on third party service providers and other key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody, risk analytics, market data, market indices and transfer agent roles, and other distribution and operational needs. if our third party service providers or other key vendors fail to fulfill their obligations to us, it could lead to operational and regulatory problems, including with respect to certain of our products, which could result in losses, enforcement actions, or reputational harm and may cause our aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet could become impaired, which would adversely affect our results of operations.
we have goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to annual impairment reviews. we also have definite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to impairment testing if indicators of impairment are identified. goodwill and intangible assets totaled $8,509.4 million and $7,358.3 million, respectively, at december 31, 2019. we may not realize the value of such assets. we perform impairment reviews of the book values of these assets on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. a variety of factors could cause such book values to become impaired. should valuations be deemed to be impaired, a write-down of the related assets would occur, adversely affecting our results of operations for the period. see item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - critical accounting policies - goodwill" and "- intangibles," for additional details of our impairment analysis process.
we operate in an industry that is highly regulated in many countries, and any enforcement action or adverse changes in the laws or regulations governing our business could decrease our revenues and profitability.
as with all investment management companies, our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business. laws and regulations applied at the national, state or provincial and local level generally grant governmental agencies and industry self-regulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over our activities, including the power to require registration or licenses, limit or restrict our business activities, conduct examinations, risk assessments, investigations and capital adequacy reviews and impose remedial programs to address perceived deficiencies. as a result of regulatory oversight, we could face requirements which negatively impact the way in which we conduct business, increase compliance costs and/or impose additional capital requirements. our regulators likewise have the authority to commence enforcement actions which could lead to sanctions up to and including the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses, the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel or the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees. further, regulators across borders could coordinate actions against us as issues arise resulting in impacts on our business in multiple jurisdictions. judgments or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities, or in private litigation against us, could affect our reputation, increase our costs of doing business and/or negatively impact our revenues. any of the effects discussed above could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
a substantial portion of the products and services we offer are regulated by the securities and exchange commission (sec), financial industry regulatory authority (finra), the commodities future trading commission (cftc), the national futures association (nfa) and the texas department of banking in the united states and by the financial conduct authority (fca) and the prudential regulatory authority (pra) in the united kingdom. subsidiaries operating in the european union (eu) are subject to various eu directives, which generally are implemented by member state national legislation and by eu regulations. our operations elsewhere in the world are regulated by similar regulatory organizations.
the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen a significant increase in regulation in recent years. various changes in laws and regulations have been enacted or otherwise implemented in multiple jurisdictions globally in response to the crisis in the financial markets that began in 2007. various other proposals remain under consideration by legislators, regulators, other government officials and other public policy commentators. certain enacted provisions and certain other proposals are potentially far reaching and, depending upon their implementation, could have a material impact on our business. while certain of these provisions appear to address perceived problems in the banking sector, some will or may be applied more broadly and affect other financial services companies, including investment managers. while invesco does not believe that the these post-crisis developments have or will fundamentally change the investment management industry or cause invesco to reconsider its basic strategy, certain provisions have required, and other provisions will or may require, us to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which we conduct business; they also have increased regulatory burdens and related compliance costs, and will or may continue to do so. more broadly, we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations. to the extent that existing regulations are interpreted or amended or future regulations are adopted in a manner that reduces the sale, or increases the redemptions, of our products and services, or that negatively affects the investment performance of our products or impacts our product mix, our aggregate aum and our revenues could be adversely affected. in addition, regulatory changes have imposed and may continue to impose additional costs or capital requirements, which could negatively impact our profitability or return on equity.
the eu has promulgated or is considering various new or revised directives pertaining to financial services, including investment managers. such directives are progressing at various stages, and generally have been, are being or will or would be implemented by national legislation in member states. ongoing changes in the eu's regulatory framework applicable to our business, including changes related to brexit and any other changes in the composition of the eu's member states, may add further complexity to our global risks and operations.
developments under regulatory changes will or may include, without limitation:
•   new or increased capital requirements and related regulation.
•   limitations on holdings of certain commodities under proposed regulations of the cftc which could result in capacity constraints for our products that employ commodities as part of their investment strategy.
•   potential limitations on the ability of our u.s. registered funds to enter into derivatives transactions under regulations of the sec.
•   regulations impacting the standard of care a financial adviser owes to its clients including the sec's best interests standard.
•   other changes to the distribution of investment funds and other investment products.
•   in 2015, the fca undertook a study of the asset management industry and released their final report in june 2017. the report highlighted a number of specific industry issues and proposed a number of remedies that will take place in a number of stages, including: changes to governance, changes to fee structures to provide clients with increased transparency, improved disclosure in client documentation, improved ability for retail clients to change share classes, changes to pension pooling and investment consultant regulations in the institutional segment and new requirements that fund sponsors evaluate the degree to which their funds provide value to fund shareholders.
•   the markets in financial instruments directive ii (mifid ii) in the eu, effective in january 2018, seeks to promote a single market for wholesale and retail transactions in financial instruments. mifid ii addresses the conduct of business rules for intermediaries providing investment services and the effective, efficient and safe operation of financial markets. key elements of mifid ii are the extent to which retrocessions may be paid and the use of trading commissions to fund research. beginning in january 2018, the company has absorbed external research costs incurred for mifid ii impacting funds and client accounts in europe. while the foregoing provisions only impact the eu, client-driven competitive pressures may cause an expansion of these principles to other business regions in which we operate, including the united states.
•   forthcoming eu regulations pertaining to integrating environmental, social and governance (esg) topics may materially impact the asset management industry in member states that adopt such legislation. for example, the eu's recent action plan on financing sustainable growth includes initiatives to integrate esg into the financial system, including such areas as mifid2, ucits and aifmd regulations.
•   an increased focus on liquidity in funds (including fixed income funds), an example of which is the sec's rules with respect to liquidity and liquidity risk management applicable to certain types of registered u.s. funds that took effect in 2018.
•   increased requirements to provide regulators and investors more granular detail regarding our products and services, including the sec's reporting modernization rule applicable to certain types of registered u.s. funds that took effect in 2018.
•   regulations pertaining to the privacy of data with respect to clients, employees and business partners. the introduction of the eu's general data protection regulation (gdpr) in 2018 strengthened privacy rules for individuals within the eu, and greatly increased penalties for non-compliance. the gdpr has also influenced direction on privacy regulations outside of the eu, most recently the state of california adopted the california consumer privacy act (ccpa) in january 2020 granting california consumers more control over the use of their personal information by organizations doing business with them. a failure to comply can result in fines levied by the california attorney general or private rights of action by consumers. looking forward, various other u.s. states are seeking to establish similar laws to ccpa, and privacy laws are being updated and strengthened in various jurisdictions globally, such as canada, india, china, and hong kong.
•   increased regulatory scrutiny on operations of private capital funds.
•   requirements pertaining to the trading of securities and other financial instruments, such as swaps and other derivatives, including certain provisions of the dodd-frank act and european market infrastructure regulation; these include significant reporting requirements, designated trading venues, mandated central clearing arrangements, restrictions on proprietary trading by certain financial institutions, other conduct requirements and potentially new taxes or similar fees.
•   phase out of the libor benchmark, which will impact interest payables or receivables on certain portfolio investments.
•   heightened regulatory examinations and inspections, including enforcement reviews, and a more aggressive posture regarding commencing enforcement proceedings resulting in fines, penalties and additional remedial activities to firms and to individuals. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, regulators in the united states and the united kingdom have taken and can be expected to continue to take a more aggressive posture on bringing enforcement proceedings.
•   enhanced licensing and qualification requirements for key personnel, including the united kingdom senior managers and certification regime, which became effective in december 2019.
•   guidelines regarding the structure and components of fund manager compensation and other additional rules and regulations and disclosure requirements. certain provisions impose additional disclosure burdens on public companies. certain proposals could impose requirements for more widespread disclosures of compensation to highly-paid individuals. depending upon the scope of any such requirements, invesco could be disadvantaged in retaining key employees vis-à-vis private companies, including hedge fund sponsors.
•   strengthening standards regarding various ethical matters, including compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act, the uk bribery act and anti-money-laundering laws and regulations.
•   regulations promulgated to address perceptions that the asset management industry, or certain of its entities or activities, pose systematic risks to the financial system.
•   regulations promulgated to protect personal data and address risks of fraud, malfeasance or other adverse consequences stemming from cyber attacks.
•   other changes impacting the identity or the organizational structure of regulators with supervisory authority over invesco.
we cannot at this time predict the full impact of potential legal and regulatory changes or possible enforcement proceedings on our business. such changes have imposed, and may continue to impose, new compliance costs and/or capital requirements or impact invesco in other ways that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. moreover, certain legal or regulatory changes could require us to modify our strategies, businesses or operations, and we may incur other new constraints or costs, including the investment of significant management time and resources in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment. in recent years, certain regulatory developments have also added downward pressures regarding fee levels.
to the extent that existing or future regulations affecting the sale of our products and services or cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of our products or services, impair the investment performance of our products or services or impact our product mix, our aum and results of operations might be adversely affected.
civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions could adversely affect our aum and future financial results, and increase our costs of doing business.
invesco and certain related entities have in recent years been subject to various legal proceedings, including civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions. these actions can arise from normal business operations and/or matters that have been the subject of previous regulatory reviews. as a global company with investment products registered in numerous countries and subject to the jurisdiction of one or more regulators in each country, at any given time, our business operations may be subject to review, investigation or disciplinary action. for example, in the united states, united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company operates, governmental authorities regularly make inquiries, hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to the company's compliance with applicable laws and regulations. lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of these inquiries may in the future be filed against the company and related entities and individuals in the united states, united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 19 -- "commitments and contingencies," for additional information. judgments in civil litigation or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities against us could affect our reputation, increase our costs of doing business and/or negatively impact our revenues, any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
insurance may not be available at a reasonable cost to protect us from liability.
we face the inherent risk of liability related to claims from clients, third-party vendors or others, actions taken by regulatory agencies and costs and losses associated with operations failures (which could include cyber incidents). to help protect against these risks, we purchase insurance in amounts, and against potential liabilities, that we consider appropriate, where such insurance is available at prices we deem reasonable. there can be no assurance, however, that a claim or claims will be covered by insurance or, if covered, will not exceed coverage limits, or that an insurer will meet its obligations regarding coverage, or that coverage will continue to be available on a cost effective basis. insurance costs are impacted by market conditions and the risk profile of the insured, and may increase significantly over relatively short periods. in addition, certain insurance coverage may not be available or may only be available at prohibitive costs. renewals of insurance policies may expose us to additional costs through higher premiums or the assumption of higher deductibles or co-insurance liability.
legislative and other measures that may be taken by u.s. and/or other governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
under current laws, as the company is domiciled and tax resident in bermuda, taxation in other jurisdictions is dependent upon the types and the extent of the activities of the company undertaken in those jurisdictions. there is a risk that changes in either the types of activities undertaken by the company or changes in tax rules relating to tax residency could subject the company and its shareholders to additional taxation.
the international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries, both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting (beps) and perceived international tax avoidance techniques. the recommendations of the beps project led by the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) and the anti-tax avoidance directive (atad) from the european union (eu) are involved in much of the coordinated activity, including:
•   in 2018, the eu introduced mandatory disclosure rules (dac6) requiring disclosure to tax authorities of cross-border arrangements entered into by taxpayers that fall within certain, broadly defined hallmarks beginning in july 1, 2020. there also are separate transitional rules that require separate reporting for any disclosable transactions occurring after june 25, 2018.
•   on july 1, 2018, the oecd enacted the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting (the multilateral instrument or mli). the mli implements several beps initiatives: action 2 - hybrid mismatch arrangements; action 6- treaty abuse; action 7 - definition of permanent establishment; and action 14- mutual agreement procedures (map) as well as arbitration.
•   the oecd has adopted a global common reporting standard for the automatic exchange of financial information among participating countries ("crs"), aimed at ensuring that persons with financial assets located outside of their tax residence country pay required taxes. in many cases, intergovernmental agreements between the participating countries will govern implementation of the new crs rules. crs is being implemented over a multi-year period and we will continue to monitor the implementing regulations and corresponding intergovernmental agreements to determine our requirements.
•   the oecd has also undertaken beps 2.0 focused on "addressing the tax challenges of the digitalization of the economy." this project may impact all multinational businesses by allocating a greater share of taxing rights to countries where consumers are located regardless of the current physical presence of a business, and by implementing a global minimum tax. there is significant uncertainty regarding such proposals, including that a few eu countries have unilaterally enacted or proposed a tax on digital services ahead of any eu wide proposal.
•   the oecd has also launched an analytical database on individual multinationals and affiliates ("adima"), a database containing public information on the physical and digital locations of corporations (including revenue, profit, income tax and number of employees.
•   bermuda has recently adopted economic substance regulations to comply with the eu code of conduct for business taxation and tax policies which will require invesco ltd. to file annual declarations beginning june 2020 demonstrating economic substance within bermuda.
as with any global implementation process there are concerns about potential lack of consistency in the local application of these items. some of the recommendations are complex while others contain optional routes, thereby increasing the likelihood of only partial or limited implementation. although the timing and methods of implementation vary, several jurisdictions have enacted legislation that is aligned with, and in some cases exceeds the scope of, the oecd's recommendations. this could lead to increased uncertainty with tax positions as well as increase the potential for double taxation.
we continually assess the impact of various u.s. federal, state and foreign legislative proposals, and modifications to existing tax treaties between the united states and foreign countries, which could result in a material increase in our u.s. federal, state or foreign taxes. we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. however, if such proposals were to be enacted, or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties, the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on the company, including increasing our tax burden, increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our future results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
on june 21, 2018, in south dakota v. wayfair, inc. (wayfair), the u.s. supreme court overruled prior court decisions that had precluded states from imposing a sales and use tax collection obligation on sellers unless they had a physical presence in the state. the wayfair decision as expected, has led to increased state nexus expansion as more states turn to economic nexus threshold laws and away from physical presence nexus tests.
the tax cuts and jobs act (the 2017 tax act) enacted on december 22, 2017, significantly reformed the taxation of business entities and included changes to u.s. federal tax rates, significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, and migrating from a "worldwide" system of taxation to a territorial system. regulations and guidance implementing the changes continue to be issued and therefore the ultimate impact of the 2017 tax act on our business and financial condition remains to be determined.
on october 21, 2016, the united states treasury and the irs published final and temporary regulations under section 385 of the internal revenue code ("385 regulations") that target the inbound financing of a foreign-parented multinational group's u.s. subsidiaries. there continues to be no immediate impacts to the company's financial position as a result of the application of the 385 regulations, however, in the future they could limit our ability to efficiently finance or otherwise choose between debt and equity transactions with our u.s. subsidiaries.
examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.
the company and its subsidiaries are subject to both income and non-income based taxes, in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions which are subject to current and potentially future tax audits in these jurisdictions. the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes (and, in certain cases, interest, fines or penalties). we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional income taxes will be due. we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, however, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.
the european commission continues to investigate certain tax rulings and beneficial regimes provided by member states to particular taxpayers that it believes may have violated the eu restriction on state aid. the investigation was triggered by the oecd / beps action plan as well as the eu's own agenda to tackle aggressive tax planning and tax avoidance. there is considerable uncertainty with the approach being taken, including retroactive application (10 year period), conflicts with oecd transfer pricing guidelines and implications to bilateral tax treaties. while the company does not believe it has received state aid, and is not a party to any investigation, due to the uncertainty of the process and retroactive nature of the assessments any potential future findings could have a materially adverse impact on the company, including increasing our tax burden, increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our future results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to shareholders.
our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders of a company incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states. as a bermuda company, we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda (companies act). the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders, including provisions relating to interested directors, mergers, amalgamations and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.
under bermuda law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only. shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company, and may only do so in limited circumstances described in the following paragraph. however, directors and officers may owe duties to a company's creditors in cases of impending insolvency. directors and officers of a bermuda company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or proposed material contract with the company or any of its subsidiaries. if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached such director's duties to that company, the director may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty.
class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda. however, the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent, which would permit a shareholder to commence an action in a company's name against the directors and officers to remedy a wrong done to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the company's corporate power or is illegal or would result in the violation of the company's memorandum of association or bye-laws. furthermore, consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of shareholders than actually approved it. under our third amended and restated bye-laws (bye-laws), each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action, both individually and on our behalf, other than those involving fraud or dishonesty, against the company or any of our officers, directors or employees. the waiver applies to any action taken by a director, officer or employee, or the failure of such person to take any action, in the performance of his or her duties, except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the director, officer or employee. this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our directors, officers and employees unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty.
our bye-laws also provide for indemnification of our directors and officers in respect of any loss arising or liability attaching to them in respect of any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to the company other than in respect of his or her own fraud or dishonesty, which is the maximum extent of indemnification permitted under the companies act.
because we are incorporated in bermuda, it may be difficult for shareholders to serve process or enforce judgments against us or our directors and officers.
the company is organized under the laws of bermuda. in addition, certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the united states. a substantial portion of the company's assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the united states. investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states or recovering against the company or these directors and officers on judgments of u.s. courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the u.s. federal securities laws, even though the company has appointed an agent in the united states to receive service of process.
further, it may not be possible in bermuda or in countries other than the united states where the company has assets to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against the company based on the civil liability provisions of u.s. federal or state securities laws. in addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of u.s. courts obtained against the company or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the u.s. federal or state securities laws or would hear actions against the company or those persons based on those laws. we have been advised by our legal advisors in bermuda that the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. some remedies available under the laws of the united states or the states therein, including some remedies available under the u.s. federal securities laws, may not be allowed in bermuda courts because they may be found to be contrary to bermuda public policy. therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on u.s. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in bermuda. similarly, those judgments may not be enforceable in other countries other than the united states.
we have anti-takeover provisions in our bye-laws that may discourage a change of control.
our bye-laws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us or to obtain majority representation on our board of directors without the consent of our board. as a result, shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares under such circumstances.
specifically, our bye-laws contain the following provisions that may impede or delay an unsolicited takeover of the company:
•   we are prohibited from engaging, under certain circumstances, in a business combination (as defined in our bye-laws) with any interested shareholder (as defined in our bye-laws) for three years following the date that the shareholder became an interested shareholder;
•   our board of directors, without further shareholder action, is permitted by our bye-laws to issue preference shares, in one or more series, and determine by resolution any designations, preferences, qualifications, privileges, limitations, restrictions, or special or relative rights of an additional series. the rights of preferred shareholders may supersede the rights of common shareholders;
•   shareholders may only remove directors for "cause" (defined in our bye-laws to mean willful misconduct or gross negligence which is materially injurious to the company, fraud or embezzlement, or a conviction of, or a plea of "guilty" or "no contest" to, a felony);
•   our board of directors is authorized to expand its size and fill vacancies; and
•   shareholders cannot act by written consent unless the consent is unanimous.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management has elected to apply the fast act modernization and simplification of regulation s-k, which provides the option to limit the discussion to the two most recent calendar years. the discussion and analysis disclosed herein apply to material changes in the consolidated financial statements for 2019 and 2018. for the comparison of 2018 and 2017, see the management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii, item 7 of the company's 2018 annual report on form 10-k, filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 22, 2019.
executive overview the following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented. this overview and the remainder of this management's discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of invesco ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "company" or "invesco") and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
global financial markets in 2019 were strong, despite periods of volatility throughout the year. the year saw global policy uncertainty and rising trade barriers. uncertainty in the economic environment and weaker industry production metrics at times in the year led the us fed and many other central banks to lower interest rates to support global growth. despite this uncertainty, the global economy grew at a modest pace. the u.s. economy grew in 2019, while the european economy slowed during the year. japan's economy expanded slightly; while china's economy grew at slightly lower levels than the prior year. global inflation fell slightly in the year.
2019 was almost entirely positive for u.s. equities, despite the uncertainty throughout the year over future fed policy and concerns about trade tensions between the u.s. and china. the central bank cut rates three times in 2019 to counter concerns about inflation growth. the s&p 500 posted multiple all-time high closing price levels and finished the year up 28.9%.
european markets were volatile in 2019, reacting to signs of weakening growth and tense trade talks, but were similarly assisted by continued accommodative monetary policies from central banks. the brexit debate continued within the uk weighing on uk equities; the uk election in december brought political clarity. also boosted by eased monetary policy, the ftse 100 ended the year up 12.1%.
japanese equities advanced in the year despite overall sentiment of a weakening economy and a difficult global trade environment. the bank of japan maintained its accommodative monetary policy. the nikkei 225 finished the period up 18.2%.
emerging market stocks also gained during the period, overcoming uncertainties over the us-china trade negotiations, general easing of growth in china and a strong us dollar.
investors sought the relative safety of bonds amidst global growth concerns and geopolitical uncertainties. the u.s. aggregate bond index was higher by 8.7% for the year.

the company's financial results are impacted by the fluctuations in exchange rates against the u.s. dollar, as discussed in the "foreign exchange impact on balance sheet, assets under management and results of operations" section and the "results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018" section below.
our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum. therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. as fee rates differ across geographic locations, changes to exchange rates have an impact on the net revenue yields.
invesco benefits from our long-term efforts to ensure a diversified base of aum. one of invesco's core strengths, and a key differentiator for the company within the industry, is our broad diversification across client domiciles, asset classes and distribution channels. our geographic diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world. this broad diversification mitigates the impact on invesco of different market cycles and enables the company to take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels.
on may 24, 2019, the company completed the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds, an investment management subsidiary of massmutual, for $5.6 billion. the strategic acquisition brings invesco's total assets under management to approximately $1.2
trillion, further enhancing the company's ability to meet client needs through its comprehensive range of high-conviction active, passive and alternative capabilities.
the highly complementary investment and distribution capabilities of invesco and oppenheimerfunds strengthen the combined organization's ability to provide more relevant investment outcomes to an expanded number of institutional and retail clients in the us and around the globe. both invesco's and oppenheimerfunds' clients benefit from the acquisition, which incorporates oppenheimerfunds' high-performing investment capabilities and its powerful u.s. third-party distribution platform with invesco's strong and diversified product lineup, global presence, and solutions-driven client outreach. we view this as a multi-year growth story that expands the capabilities we can offer globally while further scaling our business for the benefit of clients.
invesco has made significant progress toward the integration of the two firms through the combination of middle- and back- office, location strategy and leveraging the scale of the global operating platform. to date, invesco has achieved $501 million in annualized net expense synergies related to integration of the oppenheimerfunds business, which is in excess of our $475 million target and ahead of schedule. transaction, integration, and restructuring costs related to the acquisition are expected to increase from the original projection as a result of expenses related to fund mergers that were not contemplated at close, as well as incremental severance costs related to achieving increased net expense synergies. the company also will continue to incur incremental non-cash transaction, integration, and restructuring charges related to accelerated vesting of common share-based awards for terminated employees and acceleration of depreciation for software and leasehold improvement assets, as well as $120 million related to compensation payments to certain oppenheimerfunds employees, which were funded by massmutual under the terms of the acquisition.
during the year, the company purchased $669.8 million of its common shares. this amount reflects $500 million (25.8 common shares) through forward contracts, $110.8 million of common shares repurchased in the market at cost (5.6 million common shares) and $59.0 million (3.3 million common shares) relating to purchases of common shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding requirements at the time of common share vesting. at december 31, 2019, a balance of $732.2 million remains available under the common share repurchase authorization approved by the board on july 22, 2016. since announcing the $1.2 billion stock repurchase plan in october 2018, the company has repurchased $973 million of its common shares to date and is on target to repurchase the remaining $227 million by the first quarter of 2021.
invesco continues to demonstrate its commitment to supporting financial advisors with industry leading tools and resources, such as jemstep, our advisor-powered digital advice capability, and intelliflo, our advisor-focused digital platform. the range of investment capabilities available through jemstep are broad across the firm's active, alternative and etf offerings. additionally, jemstep offers open architecture to help advisors provide customized solutions for clients. as a market-leading provider of digital solutions, jemstep continues to expand its capabilities and market presence, and is an integral part of invesco's growth strategy.
presentation of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations -- impact of consolidated investment products the company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, various retail mutual funds and similar entities, private equity, real estate, fund-of-funds, collateralized loan obligation products (clos), and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. the company serves as the investment manager, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products. the company is required to consolidate certain of these managed funds from time-to-time, as discussed more fully in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 1 -- "accounting policies -- basis of accounting and consolidation." investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this form 10-k (report) as consolidated investments products (cip). the company's economic risk with respect to each investment in cip is limited to its equity ownership and any uncollected management and performance fees.
the majority of the company's cip balances are clo-related. the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos. the company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the clos, beyond the company's direct investments in, and management and performance fees generated from, the clos. if the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. likewise, the investors in the clos have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the clos. the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability.
33
the impact of cip is so significant to the presentation of the company's consolidated financial statements that the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its non-gaap disclosures. the following discussion therefore combines the results presented under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) with the company's non-gaap presentation. this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains four distinct sections, which follow after the assets under management discussion:
•   results of operations (year ended december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018);
•   schedule of non-gaap information;
•   balance sheet discussion; and
•   liquidity and capital resources.
to assess the impact of cip on the company's results of operations and balance sheet discussion, refer to part ii, item 8, financial statements, note 20, "consolidated investment products." the impact on the company's results of operations is illustrated by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of cip. for example, the impact of cip on operating revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019 was a reduction of $33.5 million. this indicates that their consolidation reduced consolidated revenues by this amount, reflecting the elimination upon their consolidation of the operating revenues earned by invesco for managing these investment products.
wherever a non-gaap measure is referenced, a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the schedule of non-gaap information, where additional details regarding the use of the non-gaap measure by the company are disclosed, along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures to the non-gaap measures. to further enhance the readability of the results of operations section, separate tables for each of the revenue, expense, and other income and expenses (non-operating income/expense) sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows, providing a section-by-section review of the company's income statements for the periods presented.

a comparison of period end spot rates between december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018 shows a strengthening of the pound sterling and the japanese yen relative to the u.s. dollar, while the euro weakened, which is reflected in the translation of our pound sterling-based, japanese yen-based and euro-based assets, liabilities and aum into u.s. dollars, respectively.
a comparison of the average foreign exchange rates used for the year ended december 31, 2019 when compared to the year ended december 31, 2018 shows a weakening of the pound sterling and the euro relative to the u.s. dollar, while the japanese yen strengthened, which is reflected in the translation of our pound sterling-based, euro-based and japanese yen- based revenue and expenses into u.s. dollars, respectively.
assets under management the following presentation and discussion of aum includes passive and active aum. passive aum include index-based etfs, unit investment trusts (uits), non-management fee earning aum and other passive mandates. active aum is total aum less passive aum.
non-management fee earning aum includes non-management fee earning etfs, uit and product leverage. the net flows in non-management fee earning aum can be relatively short-term in nature and, due to the relatively low revenue yield, these can have a significant impact on overall net revenue yield.
the aum tables and the discussion below refer to certain aum as long-term. long-term inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients, existing clients adding new accounts/funds or contributions/subscriptions into existing accounts/funds. long-term outflows reflect client redemptions from accounts/funds and include the return of invested capital on the maturity. we present net flows into money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as short-term funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to short-term interest rate movements.
in the second quarter of 2019, the company changed the presentation of its aum. the new presentation reflects the combination of the u.s and canada to form americas and continental europe to now be emea ex uk. as part of the change in the presentation of aum, the company made certain reclassifications between geographies, asset classes and active and passive classifications to better reflect the underlying aum. in the aum tables below, all periods have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation and reclassifications.
changes in aum were as follows:

(1) the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds business on may 24, 2019 added $224.4 billion in aum at that date. the acquisition of guggenheim investments' etf business on april 6, 2018 added $38.1 billion in aum at that date. as of july 1, 2018, we began including 100% of invesco great wall, which added $9.5 billion in aum during the third quarter of 2018. the acquisition of the european etf business added $26.0 billion in aum in 2017.
(2) gross revenue yield on aum is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average aum, excluding invesco great wall aum. prior to the third quarter 2018, management reflected its interests in invesco great wall on a proportional consolidation basis, which was consistent with the presentation of our share of the aum from these investments. given the company's influence on invesco great wall, a change in regulation allowing increased foreign ownership and reaching oral agreement in principle to obtain majority stake of the joint venture, the company began reporting 100% of the flows and aum for invesco great wall beginning in the third quarter of 2018. our share of the average aum in 2019 for our jvs in china was $35.6 billion (2018: $16.2 billion, 2017: $8.5 billion). it is appropriate to exclude the average aum of our jvs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on aum, because the revenues resulting from these aum are not presented in our operating revenues. under u.s. gaap, our share of the net income of the jvs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our consolidated statements of income. additionally, the numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from cip and our jvs in china; however, the denominator of the measure includes the aum of these investment products. therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from aum.
(3)   net revenue yield on aum is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average aum. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.
flows there are numerous drivers of aum inflows and outflows, including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences, fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios. we are not a party to these asset allocation decisions, as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investor's decision-making process, including their risk appetite or liquidity needs. therefore, the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows.
average aum during the year ended december 31, 2019, were $1,094.4 billion, compared to $958.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018.
market returns and reinvested distributions market gains and losses include the net change in aum resulting from changes in market values of the underlying securities from period to period. as discussed in the "executive overview" section of this management's discussion and analysis, during 2019, global financial markets were strong, despite periods of volatility throughout the year.
foreign exchange rates during the year ended december 31, 2019, we experienced increases in aum of $2.5 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates (december 31, 2018: aum decreased by $12.5 billion). see the company's disclosures regarding the changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended december 31, 2019 in the "foreign exchange impact on balance sheet, assets under management and results of operations" section above for additional information regarding the movement of foreign exchange rates.
acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2019, we completed the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds which added $224.4 billion in aum during the year. for the year ended december 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of guggenheim investments' etf business, which added $38.1 billion in aum, and we began including 100% of invesco great wall fund management company, which added $9.5 billion in aum during the year.
revenue yield changes in our aum mix significantly impact our net revenue yield. passive aum generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes, and changes in the mix of products therefore have an impact on our net revenue yield. additionally, as a significant proportion of our aum is based outside of the u.s., changes in foreign exchange rates result in a change to the mix of u.s. dollar denominated aum with aum denominated in other currencies. as fee rates differ across geographic locations, changes to exchange rates have an impact on the net revenue yields. see the company's disclosures regarding the changes in foreign exchange rates in the "foreign exchange impact on balance sheet, assets under management and results of operations" section for additional information regarding the movement of foreign exchange rates.
in the year ended december 31, 2019, the net revenue yield was 40.3 basis points compared to 39.8 basis points in the year ended december 31, 2018, an increase of 0.5 basis points. as a result of the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds, aum increased $224.4 billion during the second quarter of 2019, which was comprised of $219.9 billion of active and $4.5 billion of passive aum, increasing the proportion of active aum and positively impacting net revenue yield.
at december 31, 2019, active aum were $929.2 billion, representing 75.8% of total aum at that date; whereas at december 31, 2018, active aum were $667.2 billion, representing 75.1% of our total aum at that date. in the year ended december 31, 2019, the net revenue yield on active aum was 48.6 basis points compared to 47.5 basis points in the year ended december 31, 2018, an increase of 1.1 basis points.
at december 31, 2019, passive aum were $297.0 billion, representing 24.2% of total aum at that date; whereas at december 31, 2018, passive aum were $221.0 billion, representing 24.9% of our total aum at that date. in the year ended december 31, 2019, the net revenue yield on passive aum was 14.6 basis points compared to 15.9 basis points in the year ended december 31, 2018, a decrease of 1.3 basis points.

(1)   total revenue adjustments includes passed through investment management, service and distribution, and other revenues and equal the same amount as the third party distribution, service and advisory expenses.
(2)   net revenues are operating revenues less revenue adjustments, plus net revenues from invesco great wall, plus management and performance fees earned from cip. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues.
the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased operating revenues by $63.9 million, equivalent to 1.0% of total operating revenues, during the year ended december 31, 2019 when compared to the year ended december 31, 2018 ($45.7 million increase in 2018 or 0.9% of 2018 total operating revenues).
additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum. therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. as discussed in the executive overview, financial global markets were strong, and returns from capital markets were up in the year ended december 31, 2019.
investment management fees investment management fees increased by $424.0 million (10.4%) in the year ended december 31, 2019, to $4,506.3 million (year ended december 31, 2018: $4,082.3 million). this compares to a 14.2% increase in average aum. the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased investment management fees by $60.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. after allowing for foreign exchange movements, investment management fees increased by $484.2 million (11.9%). the increase is primarily a result of revenues earned from the acquired oppenheimerfunds business (acquired may 24, 2019). the acquisition added $219.9 billion in active aum at acquisition date.
see the company's disclosures regarding the changes in aum and revenue yields during the years ended december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018 in the "assets under management" section above for additional information regarding the impact of changes in aum on management fee yields.
service and distribution fees in the year ended december 31, 2019, service and distribution fees increased by $308.0 million (31.8%) to $1,276.5 million (year ended december 31, 2018: $968.5 million). the total increase is made up of higher distribution fees of $180.3 million, transfer agency fees of $111.0 million, and administrative fees of $7.1 million. the increase is primarily a result of revenues earned from the acquired oppenheimerfunds business (acquired may 24, 2019).
performance fees of our $1,226.2 billion in aum at december 31, 2019, approximately $48.5 billion or 4.0%, could potentially earn performance fees, including carried interests and performance fees related to partnership investments and separate accounts. of our $888.2 billion in aum at december 31, 2018, approximately $46.0 billion or 5.2%, could potentially earn performance fees, including carried interests and performance fees related to partnership investments and separate accounts.
in the year ended december 31, 2019, performance fees increased by $45.3 million (79.6%) to $102.2 million (year ended december 31, 2018: $56.9 million). performance fees in 2019 were primarily generated by $59.2 million from real estate, $20.1 million from fixed income, $11.4 million from private equity funds, $7.1 million from uk closed end funds, and $4.4 million from institutional funds. performance fees in 2018 were primarily generated by $38.7 million from real estate, $6.5 million from private equity partnerships, $5.7 million from uk close end funds and $1.2 million bank loan products.
other revenues in the year ended december 31, 2019, other revenues increased by $26.0 million (12.6%) to $232.4 million (year ended december 31, 2018: $206.4 million). the increase in other revenues was primarily driven by an increase in commissions of $35.5 million as a result of the acquired oppenheimerfunds business (acquired may 24, 2019), partially offset by decreases in uit revenues of $7.1 million and real estate transaction fees of $4.3 million.
invesco great wall the company's most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49% investment in invesco great wall fund management company limited (the "invesco great wall" joint venture). management believes that the net revenues from invesco great wall should be added to total operating revenues to arrive at net revenues, as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that invesco great wall is making. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues.
prior to the third quarter 2018, management reflected its interests in invesco great wall on a proportional consolidation basis, which was consistent with the presentation of our share of the aum from invesco great wall. given the company's influence on the invesco great wall joint venture, a change in regulation allowing increased foreign ownership, and reaching agreement in principle to obtain a majority stake of the joint venture, the company began reporting 100% of the flows and aum for invesco great wall beginning in the third quarter 2018. as a result of this change, the company's non-gaap operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying aum and flows. adjusted net income is reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to non-controlling interests.
net revenues from invesco great wall were $157.2 million and average aum was $35.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019, reflecting 100% of the flows and aum for the year. the aum increases are a result of significant growth in the china money market funds and therefore resulted in higher revenues.
net revenues from invesco great wall were $83.6 million and average aum was $16.2 billion, for the year ended december 31, 2018, reflecting 100% of the flows and aum for the six months ended december 31, 2018 and 49% of the flows and aum for the six months ended june 30, 2018.
management, performance and other fees earned from cip management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of cip in calculating net revenues. as management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products, management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues.
the elimination of management and performance fees earned from cip increased by $4.9 million to $33.5 million in the year ended december 31, 2019 (year ended december 31, 2018: $28.6 million). the increase is primarily due to the increase in management fees earned from clos.

during the year ended december 31, 2019, operating expenses increased by $1,200 million (29.2%) to $5,309.2 million (year ended december 31, 2018: $4,109.2 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased operating expenses by $48.9 million, or 0.9% of total operating expenses, during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. for the period ending december 31, 2019, the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds had a significant impact on operating expenses, including a significant increase in transaction, integration, and restructuring expense during the period. the remaining variances are from the activities of the business and are addressed below on a line-item by line-item basis.
third-party distribution, service and advisory third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include periodic "renewal" commissions paid to brokers and independent financial advisors for the continuing oversight of their clients' assets over the time they are invested and are payments for the servicing of client accounts. renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the aum value and apply to much of the company's non-u.s. retail operations. as discussed above, the revenues from the company's u.s. retail operations include 12b-1 distribution fees, which are largely passed through to brokers who sell the funds as third-party distribution expenses along with additional marketing support distribution costs. both the revenues and the costs are dependent on the underlying aum of the brokers' clients. third-party distribution expenses also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to broker-dealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge (a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of aum within a certain contracted period of time). the upfront distribution commissions are amortized over the redemption period. also included in third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are sub-transfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client common share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. these costs are reimbursed by the related funds.
third party distribution service and advisory expenses increased by $284.8 million (17.7%) in the year ended december 31, 2019 to $1,893.0 million (year ended december 31, 2018: $1,608.2 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased third party costs by $9.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in costs was $293.8 million. included is an increase of $231.5 million in service fees (primarily 12b-1 fees), $39.7 million in asset and sales based fees, $28.4 million in transaction fees, $26.7 million in fund expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $41.7 million in renewal commissions and $7.0 million in unitary fees. the increase is primarily a result of costs from the acquired oppenheimerfunds business (acquired may 24, 2019). see "schedule of non-gaap information" for additional disclosures.
employee compensation employee compensation includes salary, cash bonuses and common share-based payment plans designed to attract and retain the highest caliber employees. employee staff benefit plan costs and payroll taxes are also included in employee compensation.
employee compensation increased $214.9 million (14.4%) to $1,709.3 million in the year ended december 31, 2019 (year ended december 31, 2018: $1,494.4 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased employee compensation by $23.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in employee compensation was $238.4 million.
compensation in 2019 increased $238.4 million due to increases in base salaries of $95.3 million, share-based compensation of $69.4 million, $51.3 million of commissions and bonuses, and $13.6 million in staff benefits. these increases were driven by increased headcount as a result of the oppenheimerfunds acquisition (acquired may 24, 2019).
headcount at december 31, 2019 was 8,821 (december 31, 2018; 7,459).
marketing marketing expenses include the cost of direct advertising of our products through trade publications, television and other media, and public relations costs, such as the marketing of the company's products through conferences or other sponsorships, and the cost of marketing-related employee travel.
marketing expenses increased by $0.8 million (0.6%) in the year ended december 31, 2019 to $135.6 million (year ended december 31, 2018: $134.8 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased marketing expenses by $2.2 million. after allowing for foreign exchange rate movements, marketing expenses increased $3.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.
property, office and technology property, office and technology expenses include rent and utilities for our various leased facilities, depreciation of company-owned property, capitalized software and computer equipment costs, minor non-capitalized computer equipment and software purchases and related maintenance payments, and costs related to externally provided operations, technology, middle office, and back office management services.
property, office and technology expenses increased by $83.6 million (20.4%) to $494.1 million in the year ended december 31, 2019 (year ended december 31, 2018: $410.5 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased property, office and technology expenses by $5.8 million during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. after allowing for foreign exchange rate movements, expenses increased $89.4 million. this increase was comprised of lease expenses of $23.7 million, software maintenance of $23.3 million, outsourced administration costs of $20.1 million and depreciation of $16.5 million. the increase is primarily a result of the acquired oppenheimerfunds business (acquired may 24, 2019).
general and administrative general and administrative expenses include professional services costs, such as information service subscriptions, irrecoverable taxes, non-marketing related employee travel expenditures, consulting fees, audit, tax and legal fees, professional insurance costs and recruitment and training costs.
general and administrative expenses increased by $79.8 million (24.6%) to $404.2 million in the year ended december 31, 2019 (year ended december 31, 2018: $324.4 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased general and administrative expenses by $8.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. after allowing for foreign exchange rate movements, the increase was $88.2 million.
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2019 included increases of $27.9 million in market data services costs, $16.7 million in professional services and regulatory costs, $15.0 million in operational costs incurred by cip and $10.3 million on foreign currency revaluation costs. 2019 reflects a net increase of $19.4 million in vat, as 2018 included a credit of $26.7 million related to a one-time vat recovery related to additional regulatory guidance.
transaction, integration, and restructuring the transaction, integration and restructuring charges reflect legal, regulatory, advisory, valuation and other professional services or consulting fees, and travel costs related to a business combination transaction or restructuring initiatives related to changes in business strategy. also included in these charges are severance-related expenses and any contract termination costs associated with these efforts. additionally, these charges reflect the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction or initiative, and the post-closing costs of amortizing acquired intangible assets and integrating an acquired business into the company's existing operations, including incremental costs associated with achieving expense savings following a business combination or restructuring initiative.
transaction, integration, and restructuring charges were $673.0 million in the year ended december 31, 2019 (year ended december 31, 2018: $136.9 million). within the transaction, integration, and restructuring related costs, $625.0 million resulted from the oppenheimerfunds acquisition, which included severance and other personnel-related charges of $319.4 million, share-based compensation expenses of $33.0 million, legal, consulting and other professional fees of $205.7 million, property and equipment expenses of $21.5 million, marketing expenses of $22.5 million, and amortization of intangible assets of $22.9 million. transaction, integration, and restructuring costs from other acquisitions included amortization of management contracts and other intangible assets of $24.7 million.

interest expense interest expense increased by $24.2 million (21.7%) to $135.7 million in the year ended december 31, 2019 (year ended december 31, 2018: $111.5 million) the increase is primarily driven by the interest on the forward contracts which amounted to $27.2 million in interest.
other gains and losses, net other gains and losses, net were a net gain of $65.7 million in the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to a net loss of $40.0 million in the year ended december 31, 2018. included in the gain were $47.5 million of net gains related to the mark-to-market on seed money investments, $35.0 million of gains on the appreciation of investments and instruments held for our deferred compensation plans, and $5.2 million of gains related to our defined benefit pension plans. these gains were partially offset by losses during the period of $8.9 million of net foreign exchange losses on intercompany loans, $7.8 million of contingent consideration liability and $4.8 million related to market valuation adjustments on foreign put option contracts. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, - note , "other gains and losses, net" for additional information.
other income/(expense) of cip in the year ended december 31, 2019, interest and dividend income of cip increased by $70.0 million (25.4%) to $345.4 million (year ended december 31, 2018: $275.4 million). interest expense of cip increased by $37.8 million (19.8%) to $228.5 million (year ended december 31, 2018: $190.7 million).
the increase in interest income and interest expense of cip in 2019 is primarily due to the impact of newly consolidated clos and other funds during 2019, partially offset by the impact of funds deconsolidated during the year.
included in other gains/(losses) of cip, net, are realized and unrealized gains and losses on the underlying investments and debt of cip. in the year ended december 31, 2019, other gains and losses of cip were a net gain of $32.9 million, as compared to a net loss of $55.1 million in the year ended december 31, 2018. the net gain during 2019 were attributable to market-driven gains of investments held by consolidated funds.
net impact of cip and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities the net impact to net income attributable to invesco ltd. in each period primarily represents the changes in the value of the company's holding in its consolidated clos, which is reclassified into other gains/(losses) from accumulated other comprehensive income upon consolidation. the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31, 2019 resulted in a net decrease to net income attributable to invesco ltd. of $1.6 million (year ended december 31, 2018: $8.8 million net increase).
noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in cip. the impact of any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of non-clo cip attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by resulting changes in gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and therefore do not have a material effect on the financial condition, operating results (including earnings per common share), liquidity or capital resources of the company's common shareholders. similarly, any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of clos attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by the calculated value of the notes issued by the clos (offsetting in other gains/(losses) of cip) and therefore also do not have a material effect on the financial condition, operating results (including earnings per common share), liquidity or capital resources of the company's common shareholders.
additionally, cip represent less than 1% of the company's aum. therefore, the net gains or losses of cip are not indicative of the performance of the company's aggregate aum.
income before taxes total income before taxes includes income/losses of cip; however, the company's operating revenues earned from cip are not included in operating revenues under u.s. gaap, as such operating revenues are eliminated upon consolidation. therefore, total u.s. and foreign income before taxes in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note , "taxation,", which includes income/losses from cip, and u.s. and foreign operating revenues in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note 18, "geographic information," in which cip has been eliminated, may not correlate. the table included in the taxation footnote is formatted such that the income of cip is separately stated so that the impact of cip is evident.
total u.s. income before taxes increased $19.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2019 to $511.1 million from $491.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 and includes u.s. income of cip of $24.2 million (december 31, 2018: $18.9 million). u.s. income from cip increased $5.3 million (28.0%) from 2018 primarily due to the impact of gains on consolidated retail products. excluding cip, u.s. income before taxes in 2019 increased $14.0 million (3.0%) from december 31, 2018 due to a larger increase in u.s. operating revenues than operating expenses.
total foreign income before taxes decreased $184.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2019 to $461.8 million from $646.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2018 and includes foreign income of cip of $23.7 million (december 31, 2018: foreign loss of cip of $9.8 million). foreign income from cip increased $33.5 million due primarily to the impact of gains on consolidated retail products. excluding cip, foreign income decreased by $218.0 million (33.2%) from 2018 due to a larger decrease in foreign operating revenues and other income than operating expenses.
income tax expense our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased to 24.2% (year ended december 31, 2018: 22.4%). 2019 includes a 1.1% rate increase related to vestings of our annual common share-based compensation awards, a net 1.5% rate increase from business acquisitions including the impact from non-tax deductible transaction, integration, and restructuring costs partially offset by a 0.7% rate decrease related to the favorable resolution of a state tax audit. the inclusion of income from non-controlling interests decreased our rate period-over-period by 1.3% (1.3% decrease to the effective tax rate in 2019 and no change to the effective tax rate in 2018). the remainder of the rate movement for 2019 was primarily due to changes in the mix of pre-tax income.
schedule of non-gaap information we utilize the following non-gaap performance measures: net revenue (and by calculation, net revenue yield on aum), adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd. and adjusted diluted earnings per common share (eps). the company believes the adjusted measures provide valuable insight into the company's ongoing operational performance and assist in comparisons to its competitors. these measures also assist the company's management with the establishment of operational budgets and forecasts and assist the board of directors and management of the company in determining incentive compensation decisions. the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on aum), operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to invesco ltd. and diluted eps. each of these measures is discussed more fully below.
the following are reconciliations of operating revenues, operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), and net income attributable to invesco ltd. (and by calculation, diluted eps) on a u.s. gaap basis to a non-gaap basis of net revenues, adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), and adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd. (and by calculation, adjusted diluted eps). these non-gaap measures should not be considered as substitutes for any u.s. gaap measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-gaap measures if deemed appropriate. the tax effects related to the reconciling items have been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction to which the transaction relates. notes to the reconciliations follow the tables.

*   operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues.
**   adjusted operating margin is equal to adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.
***   adjusted diluted eps is equal to adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd. divided by the weighted average number of common and restricted common shares outstanding. there is no difference between the calculated earnings per common share amounts presented above and the calculated earnings per common share amounts under the two class method.
(1)   invesco great wall prior to the third quarter 2018, management reflected its interests in invesco great wall on a proportional consolidation basis, which was consistent with the presentation of our share of the aum from these investments. given the company's influence on invesco great wall, a change in regulation allowing increased foreign ownership, and reaching oral agreement in principle in the third quarter of 2018 to obtain a majority stake of the joint venture, the company began reporting 100% of the flows and aum for invesco great wall. also beginning in the third quarter of 2018, the company's non-gaap operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying aum and flows. adjusted net income is reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to non-controlling interests.
(2)   revenue adjustments the company has changed its presentation of the reconciliation between operating revenues and net revenues. all periods have been conformed to the new presentation. neither operating revenues nor net revenues have changed for any historic periods.
management believes that adjustments to investment management fees, service and distribution fees and other revenues from operating revenues appropriately reflect these revenues as being passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the company's managed funds. further, these adjustments vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels. the net revenue presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business, removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with u.s. peer investment managers and within invesco's own investment units. additionally, management evaluates net revenue yield on aum, which is equal to net revenues divided by average aum during the reporting period. this financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of aum we manage and is useful when evaluating the company's performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes.
investment management fees are adjusted by renewal commissions and certain administrative fees. service and distribution fees are primarily adjusted by distribution fees passed through to broker dealers for certain share classes and pass through fund-related costs. other is primarily adjusted by transaction fees passed through to third parties. while the terms used for these types of adjustments vary by geography, they are all costs that are closely linked to the value of aum and the revenue earned by invesco from aum. since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the third-party arrangements, the company must reflect these revenues and expenses gross under u.s. gaap on the consolidated statements of income.
(3)   cip see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 20 - "consolidated investment products" for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company's consolidated financial statements from the consolidation of cip. the reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the u.s. gaap consolidated statements of income.
management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues, operating income and net income for the impact of cip in calculating the respective net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted net income.

(4)   transaction, integration and restructuring related adjustments the transaction, integration and restructuring charges reflect legal, regulatory, advisory, valuation and other professional services or consulting fees, and travel costs related to a business combination transaction or restructuring initiatives related to changes in business strategy. also included in these charges are severance-related expenses and any contract termination costs associated with these efforts. additionally, these charges reflect the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction or initiative, and the post-closing costs of amortizing acquired intangible assets and integrating an acquired business into the company's existing operations, including incremental costs associated with achieving synergy savings following a business combination or restructuring initiative.
management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements to adjust for the transaction, integration and restructuring charges in arriving at adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted eps, as this will aid comparability of our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and restructuring related charges. see "results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018 -- transaction, integration and restructuring" for additional details.
(5)    market movement on deferred compensation plan liabilities certain deferred compensation plan awards are linked to the appreciation (depreciation) of specified investments, typically managed by the company. invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet and through total return swap financial instruments. u.s. gaap requires the appreciation (depreciation) in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense. the full value of the investment and financial instrument appreciation (depreciation) are immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses. this creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to invesco ltd. and diluted eps which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multi-year vesting period. during periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense, operating income and operating margin in a manner which, over the life of the award, will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the consolidated statements of income. the non-gaap measures exclude the mismatch created by differing u.s. gaap treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments.
since these plans are hedged economically, management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin) and adjusted net income (and by calculation, adjusted diluted eps), to produce results that will be more comparable period to period. the related fund shares or swaps will have been purchased on or around the date of grant, eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period.
additionally, dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company's consolidated statements of income on the record dates. this dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company. the non-gaap measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense.

(a)   general and administrative expenses for 2015 include a provision of $12.6 million pertaining to regulatory actions and related legal fees of $0.5 million (2016: $1.0 million).
(b)   as a result of an increase in our recoverable vat from applying additional regulatory guidance, a credit was recorded in the third quarter of 2018. the portion of the cumulative adjustment representing 2015 through 2017 has been removed for non-gaap purposes.
(c)   operating expenses for 2017 reflect the cost of multiple senior executive retirements. the costs incurred in one quarter was unprecedented and the company deemed it appropriate to adjust these costs from the u.s. gaap total compensation in an effort to isolate and evaluate our level of compensation going forward. the result of this adjustment was $19.7 million related to accelerated vesting of deferred compensation and other separation costs.
(d)   general and administrative expenses for 2015 include charges of $4.7 million in respect of a multi-year fund reimbursement expense associated with historical private equity management fees. the charge resulted primarily from using a more appropriate methodology regarding the calculation of offsets to management fees.
(e)   included within other gains and losses, net is the mark-to-market of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the pound sterling/u.s. dollar and the euro/u.s.
dollar foreign exchange rates. the pound sterling contracts provide coverage through june 30, 2020 and the euro contracts provided coverage through december 27, 2017. the adjustment from u.s. gaap to non-gaap earnings removes the impact of market volatility; therefore, the company's non-gaap results include only the amortization of the cost of the contracts during the contract period.
(f)   employee benefit plan termination: operating expenses for 2016 include an incremental credit of $8.6 million related to an employee benefit plan termination.
(g)   during 2015, the company acquired investment management contracts from deutsche bank and the purchase price was solely comprised of contingent consideration payable in future periods. adjustment represents the change in the fair value of contingent consideration liability.
(h)   other gains and losses for 2017 includes a realized gain of $12.1 million related to revaluation of euros held in the uk in anticipation of payment for the european etf business acquisition.
(i)   other-than-temporary impairment includes an impairment charge of $17.8 million in 2016 that is related to the acquisition of invesco asset management (india) private limited.
(j)   the income tax provision for 2017 includes a retroactive state tax expense of $12.2 million related to 2016 and prior open tax years caused by changes in state tax regulations. 2017 also included a $130.7 million tax benefit as a result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities following the 2017 tax act enacted in the united states.

cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents decreased by $98.7 million from $1,147.7 million at december 31, 2018 to $1,049.0 million at december 31, 2019. see "cash flows discussion" in the following section within this management's discussion and analysis for additional discussion regarding the movements in cash flows during the periods. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 1, "accounting policies - cash and cash equivalents," regarding requirements to retain liquid resources in certain jurisdictions.
investments as of december 31, 2019 we had $829.5 million in investments (december 31, 2018: $613.5 million). included in investments are $235.5 million of seed money investments in affiliated funds used to seed funds as we launch new products, and $192.4 million of investments related to assets held for deferred compensation plans, which are also held primarily in affiliated funds. seed investments increased by $32.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase in the period reflects purchases of $72.6 million, a non-cash increase of $10.7 million due to the oppenheimerfunds acquisition, a non-cash increase of $45.5 million due to the deconsolidation of certain cip in the period (restoring the company's formerly eliminated investment balances), and $38.6 million driven by market valuation changes and foreign exchange movements. the increases in the period were partially offset by redemptions of $134.7 million. investments related to deferred compensation awards increased by a net $113.8 million during the period due to the oppenheimerfunds acquisition of $165.9 million, net purchases of $25.0 million and $18.4 million driven by market valuation changes and foreign exchange movements. these increases were partially offset by dispositions of $95.5 million.
included in investments are $350.8 million in equity method investments in invesco great wall and in certain of the company's private equity partnerships, real estate partnerships and other co-investments (december 31, 2018: $296.3 million). the increase of $54.5 million in equity method investments was driven by an increase from partnership contributions of $92.7 million and $56.3 million in current period earnings. this increase was partially offset by a decrease of $94.6 million due to distributions from partnership investments. also included in investments are foreign time deposits of $32.0 million, an increase of $3.9 million from the december 31, 2018 balance of $28.1 million.
assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables one of our subsidiaries, invesco pensions limited, is an insurance company that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the uk. the entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability. the decrease in the balance of these accounts from $11,384.8 million at december 31, 2018, to $10,835.6 million at december 31, 2019, was the result of negative market movements of $572.7 million and net business outflows of $356.3 million, partially offset by positive foreign exchange rate movements of $379.8 million.
intangible assets, net intangible assets reflect a net increase of $5,182.2 million from $2,176.1 million at december 31, 2018 to $7,358.3 million at december 31, 2019. the increase includes an additional $5,189.0 million primarily related to the preliminary purchase price allocation to intangible assets from the oppenheimerfunds acquisition, offset by amortization of $52.7 million. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note , "intangible assets," for an analysis of the change in intangible balances between periods. the 2019 and 2018 annual impairment reviews of indefinite-lived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates.
goodwill goodwill increased from $7,157.1 million at december 31, 2018 to $8,509.4 million at december 31, 2019. the increase includes $1,229.1 million primarily related to the preliminary purchase price allocation to goodwill from the oppenheimerfunds acquisition and foreign exchange movements of $123.2 million. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note , "goodwill," for an analysis of the change in goodwill balances between periods. the company's annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of october 1 of each year. as a result of that analysis, the company determined that no impairment existed at that date. see "critical accounting policies - goodwill" for additional details of the company's goodwill impairment analysis process.

other assets other assets increased from $1,325.9 million at december 31, 2018 to $2,042.7 million at december 31, 2019. the increase includes the right-of-use asset of $325.0 million, which resulted from the adoption of the accounting lease standard in the current year. the accounting lease standard requires the company to recognize all leases with a lease term greater than 12 months on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset. see item 8, notes to the consolidated financial statements - note 14, "operating leases" for additional information regarding the increase due to the right of use asset. additional increases include an increase of $251.6 million in accounts receivable and $114.8 million in property, equipment and software which has resulted primarily from the oppenheimer acquisition.
long-term debt long-term debt decreased from $2,408.8 million at december 31, 2018, to $2,080.3 million at december 31, 2019, a decrease of $328.5 million. as of december 31, 2019, there was no balance outstanding on the credit facility (at december 31, 2018: $330.8 million).
other liabilities other liabilities increased from $2,060.1 million at december 31, 2018 to $4,464.2 million at december 31, 2019. the increase includes $1,181.2 million resulting from the preliminary purchase price allocation to deferred tax liabilities from the oppenheimerfunds acquisition. see item 8, notes to the consolidated financial statements - note 2, "business combinations" for additional information regarding the deferred tax liabilities.
the increase also includes the lease liability of $364.8 million, which resulted from the adoption of the accounting lease standard in the current year. the accounting lease standard requires the company to recognize all leases with a lease term greater than 12 months on the balance sheet as a lease liability. see item 8, notes to the consolidated financial statements - note 14, "operating leases" for additional information regarding the increase due to the lease liability.
accrued bonus and deferred compensation increased by $292.3 million primarily as a result of increases in our deferred compensation liability, severance accruals and retention awards in connection with the oppenheimerfunds acquisition and the overall bonus accrual driven by the larger headcount post-acquisition. additional increases resulted from forward contracts that the company entered into to purchase its common shares. during the year ended december 31, 2019, the company entered into three new forward contracts and settled one forward contract. the net effect resulted in an increase in other liabilities of $199.4 million. see item 8, notes to the consolidated financial statements - note 10, "share capital" for additional information regarding the forward contracts.
liquidity and capital resources our capital structure, together with available cash balances, cash flows generated from operations, existing capacity under our credit facility and further capital market activities, if necessary, should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. material changes in the company's capital structure over the last two years include:
2019: as discussed in note 2, "business combinations," the company completed its acquisition of oppenheimerfunds on may 24, 2019. consideration for the acquisition included 81.9 million shares, which were composed of 75.7 million newly issued common shares and 6.2 million employee restricted common stock awards. the company also issued $4.0 billion in perpetual, non-cumulative preferred shares with a 21-year non-call period and a fixed rate of 5.9%.
the preferred stock dividend is payable quarterly on a non-cumulative basis when, if and as declared by our board of directors. however, if we have not declared and paid or set aside for payment full quarterly dividends on the preferred stock for a particular dividend period, we may not declare or pay dividends on, or redeem, purchase or acquire, our common stock or other junior securities in the next succeeding dividend period. shares of preferred stock cannot be redeemed prior to the 21st anniversary of their original issue date. the preferred stock has no put feature to accelerate redemption and will not be convertible into any other class of capital stock of the company.
see "dividends" section below for a discussion of the preferred and common dividends.
the company repurchased 5.6 million common shares in open market transactions utilizing $110.8 million in cash and entered into three forward contracts during 2019, whereby the counterparty purchased $500.0 million (25.8 million shares) of the company's common shares. see note 10, "share capital" for details of these forward contracts and the related treasury shares recorded as of december 31, 2019. additionally, during the year, 3.3 million common shares were withheld on vesting events in the amount of $59.0 million relating to purchases of common shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding requirements at the time of common share vesting. since the common stock buyback program announcement in 2018, the company has purchased $973 million of its common shares.
the forward contract completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 for $300 million of common shares settled on july 1, 2019.
during 2019, the company paid $330.8 million towards the outstanding balance on the credit facility. as of december 31, 2019 the remaining balance on the credit facility was zero.
2018: on october 18, 2018, the company announced a common stock buyback program of $1.2 billion to be completed by the first quarter of 2021, which will be financed through the strong operating cash flows of the combined invesco and oppenheimerfunds organization. for the purpose of repurchasing its common shares, the company entered into a forward contract during the fourth quarter of 2018. under this contract, the counterparty purchased $300 million (14.4 million shares) of the company's common shares in the fourth quarter. the common shares were included as treasury shares in the company's balance sheet and reduced outstanding common shares as of december 3, 2018.
on april 6, 2018, the company completed the acquisition of guggenheim investments' etf business for a purchase price of $1.2 billion. to fund the purchase, the company borrowed approximately $835 million on its credit facility in early april 2018. in addition, the company also borrowed on the credit facility to fund part of the intelliflo acquisition. as of december 31, 2018, the remaining balance on the credit facility was $330.8 million.
our capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include:
•   reinvestment in the business;
•   moderate annual growth of dividends (as further discussed in the "dividends" section below);
•   share repurchase; and
•   target an approximate $1 billion cash buffer in excess of european regulatory and liquidity requirements.
these priorities are executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain a strong, investment-grade credit rating. as of the filing of this report, invesco held credit ratings of a2/stable, bbb+/stable and a-/positive from moody's, s&p, and fitch ratings, respectively. our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit ratings, the condition of the global economy, investors' willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. see also item 1a - "risk factors," for more detailed discussion on reliance on credit ratings.
certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital. such requirements may change from time-to-time as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors, including balance sheet composition, assessment of risk exposures and governance, and review from regulators. these and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital, repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities. all of our regulated eu and uk subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under applicable eu and uk requirements, including those arising from the eu's capital requirements directive and the uk's internal capital adequacy assessment process (icaap), and capital is maintained within this european sub-group to satisfy these regulations. we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash equivalents. this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european sub-group in the countries where it is located. due to the capital restrictions, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. in addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences. we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. as of december 31, 2019, the company's minimum regulatory capital requirement was $753.6 million (december 31, 2018: $720.2 million); the increase was primarily driven by the strengthening of the pound sterling against the u.s. dollar. the total amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents was $847.0 million at december 31, 2019 (december 31, 2018: $996.7 million).
the consolidation of $8,633.1 million and $6,234.6 million of total assets and long-term debt of cip as of december 31, 2019, respectively, did not impact the company's liquidity and capital resources. the majority of cip balances related to consolidated clos. the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos. the company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the clos, beyond the company's direct investments in, and management and performance fees generated from, these products, which are eliminated upon consolidation. if the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. likewise, if the clos were to liquidate, their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company. the company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 20, "consolidated investment products," for additional details.

cash flow discussion the ability to consistently generate cash flow from operations in excess of dividend payments, common share repurchases, capital expenditures, and ongoing operating expenses is one of our company's fundamental financial strengths. operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings. our principal uses of cash, other than for operating expenses, include dividend payments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, purchase of our common shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products.
the following table represents a reconciliation of the cash flow information presented on a u.s. gaap basis to the cash flow information, excluding the impact of the cash flows of consolidated investment products for the reasons outlined in footnote 1 to the table:

(1)   these tables include non-gaap presentations. cash held by cip is not available for use by invesco. additionally, there is no recourse to invesco for cip debt. the cash flows of cip do not form part of the company's cash flow management processes, nor do they form part of the company's significant liquidity evaluations and decisions.
as discussed in note 2, "business combination," the oppenheimerfunds acquisition purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values as of the date of the transaction. the issuance of common stock and preferred stock consideration represents a non-cash financing activity related to the statement of cash flows.
operating activities operating cash flows include the receipt of investment management and other fees generated from aum, offset by operating expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities. although some receipts and payments are seasonal, particularly bonus payments which are paid out during the first quarter, in general, after allowing for the change in cash held by cip, and investment activities, our operating cash flows move in the same direction as our operating income.
during 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $1,116.6 million compared to $828.8 million provided during 2018 (an increase of $287.8 million). as shown in the tables above, the impact of cip to operating activities was $158.3 million of cash used during 2019 compared to $234.2 million of cash used during 2018. excluding the impact of cip, cash provided by operations was $1,274.9 million during 2019 compared to $1,063.0 million of cash provided by operations during 2018. cash inflows for the year ended december 31, 2019, excluding the impact of cip, included net investment redemptions of $156.4
63
million, including seed money and deferred compensation investments (year ended december 31, 2018: net purchases $144.2 million) as well as net inflows from the changes in payables and receivables due to the timing of payments and receipts, primarily related to the growth in business that resulted from oppenheimerfunds acquisition in 2019 compared to net outflows in the year ended december 31, 2018. inflows were partially offset by lower net income in the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to year ended december 31, 2018 driven by transaction and integration expenses of $673.0 million compared to $136.9 million in the prior period due to the acquisition in 2019.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,425.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 (2018: net cash used in $2,898.7 million). as shown in the tables above, the impact of cip on investing activities, including investment purchases, sales and returns of capital, was $1,507.4 million used (2018: $1,248 million used). excluding the impact of cip cash flows, net cash provided by investing activities was $82.0 million (2018: net cash used of $1,650.7 million).
cash inflows for the year ended december 31, 2019, excluding the impact of cip, included net cash acquired of $290.5 million primarily related to the oppenheimerfunds acquisition (year ended december 31, 2018: outflows of $1,469.3 million). see note 2, "business combination," for additional information regarding cash acquired as a result of the acquisition. also included in cash inflows for the year ended december 31, 2019, were net collateral received of $26.0 million on the forward contracts (year ended december 31, 2018: net collateral paid of $63.8 million) and collected proceeds of $215.5 million from sales and returns of capital of investments (year ended december 31, 2018: $197.9 million). these inflows were partially offset by purchases of investments of $325.7 million (year ended december 31, 2018: $213.0 million).
during the year ended december 31, 2019, the company had capital expenditures of $124.3 million (2018: $102.5 million). our capital expenditures related principally in each period to technology initiatives, including enhancements to platforms from which we maintain our portfolio management systems and fund accounting systems, improvements in computer hardware and software desktop products for employees, new telecommunications products to enhance our internal information flow, and back-up disaster recovery systems. also, in each period, a portion of these costs related to leasehold improvements made to the various buildings and workspaces used in our offices. these projects have been funded with proceeds from our operating cash flows. in 2019, our capital expenditures also included technology integrations related to the oppenheimerfunds acquisition.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled $201.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 (2018: cash provided of $1,540.0 million). as shown in the tables above, the impact of cip on financing activities provided cash of $1,674.6 million during the year (2018: cash provided of $1,767.2 million). excluding the impact of cip, financing activities used cash of $1,473.3 million in the year ended december 31, 2019 (2018: cash used of $227.2 million).
financing cash outflows during the year ended december 31, 2019 included $529.1 million of dividend payments for the dividends declared in january, april, july and november 2019 (year ended december 31, 2018: dividends paid of $490.6 million), $123.6 million of preferred dividend payments for dividends declared in the in july and november 2019 (year ended december 31, 2018: none), net repayment on the credit facility of $330.8 million ( year ended december 31, 2018: net borrowing of $330.8 million), $300 million settlement of the forward contract completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 (year ended december 31, 2018: none), purchase of common shares through open market transactions totaling $110.8 million (year ended december 31, 2018: none), the payment of $59.0 million to meet employees' withholding tax obligations on common share vestings (year ended december 31, 2018: $51.8 million), and a payment of $20.0 million of contingent consideration (year ended december 31, 2018: $15.6 million).
dividends when declared, invesco pays dividends on a quarterly basis in arrears. holders of our preferred shares are eligible to receive dividends at an annual rate of 5.9% of the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, or $59 per share per annum. the preferred stock dividend is payable quarterly on a non-cumulative basis when, if and as declared by our board of directors. however, if we have not declared and paid or set aside for payment full quarterly dividends on the preferred stock for a particular dividend period, we may not declare or pay dividends on, or redeem, purchase or acquire, our common stock or other junior securities in the next succeeding dividend period. in addition, if we have not declared and paid or set aside for payment quarterly dividends on the preferred stock for six quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors of the company will be increased by two and the holders of the preferred shares shall have the right to elect such two additional members of the board of directors.
on january 29, 2020, the company announced a preferred dividend of $14.75 per preferred share to the holders of preferred shares, representing the period from december 1, 2019 through february 29, 2020, payable on march 2, 2020, to shareholders of record at the close of business on february 14, 2020.
on january 29, 2020, the company declared a fourth quarter 2019 dividend of $0.31 per common share, payable on march 2, 2020, to shareholders of record at the close of business on february 13, 2020 with an ex-dividend date of february 12, 2020.
the declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be declared by our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements at the time such declaration and payment are considered. the board has a policy of managing dividends in a prudent fashion, with due consideration given to profit levels, overall debt levels, and historical dividend payouts.
common share repurchase plan during the year ended december 31, 2019, the company repurchased 5.6 million common shares in the open market at a cost of $110.8 million (december 31, 2018: none) separately, an aggregate of 3.3 million common shares were withheld on vesting events during the year ended december 31, 2019 to meet employees' withholding tax obligations (december 31, 2018: 1.6 million). the fair value of these shares withheld at the respective withholding dates was $59.0 million (december 31, 2018: $48.9 million).
additionally, during the year ended december 31, 2019, the company entered into three forward contracts to repurchase $500.0 million of shares as part of its announced $1.2 billion common stock buyback program. under these contracts, the counterparty purchased 25.8 million shares during the year ended december 31, 2019 (december 31, 2018: $300.0 million; 14.4 million shares). see note 10, "share capital" for details of these forward contracts and the related treasury shares recorded as of december 31, 2019. at december 31, 2019, approximately $732.2 million remained authorized under the company's common share repurchase authorization approved by the board on july 22, 2016 (december 31, 2018: $1,343.0 million).

(1)   adjustments for unrealized gains and losses from investments, as defined in our credit facility, may also include non-cash gains and losses on investments to the extent that they do not represent anticipated future cash receipts or expenditures.
(2)   ebitda and adjusted debt are non-gaap financial measures; however management does not use these measures for anything other than these debt covenant calculations. the calculation of ebitda above (a reconciliation from net income attributable to invesco ltd.) is defined by our credit agreement, and therefore net income attributable to invesco ltd. is the most appropriate gaap measure from which to reconcile to ebitda. the calculation of adjusted debt is defined in our credit facility and equals total debt of $2,080.3 million plus $11.2 million in letters of credit.
the discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the company's liquidity and capital resources. the item 1. business -- risk management section contains a broader discussion of the company's overall approach to risk management.
credit and liquidity risk capital management involves the management of the company's liquidity and cash flows. the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit, liquidity and market risks, such as interest rate and foreign currency risks (as discussed in item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk"), through measurement and analysis. the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are held by external firms. the company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products, as well as with external high credit-quality financial institutions. these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk.
credit risk credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to meet an obligation. all cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk, as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions. as of december 31, 2019, our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is $1,049.0 million. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 21, "related parties," for information regarding cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds.
the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk. the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations.
66
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities as the same become due. the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its $2,080.3 million in total debt. the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods, reviewing them regularly with senior management, maintaining a committed credit facility, scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialogue.
effects of inflation inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways. first, inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure, especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted. to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment, our profitability could be negatively impacted. secondly, the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum.
off balance sheet commitments see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note , "commitments and contingencies - off balance sheet commitments," for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments.
contractual obligations we have various financial obligations that require future cash payments. the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of december 31, 2019:

____________
(1)   long-term debt includes $2,080.3 million of fixed rate debt. fixed interest payments are reflected in the table above in the periods they are due, and include any issuance discounts. the table above includes the company's debt; debt of cip is excluded from the table above, as the company is not obligated for these amounts. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note , "consolidated investment products," for additional information.
(2)   operating leases reflect obligations for leased building space and other assets.
included in the table above is an additional operating lease the company entered into during the third quarter of 2019, but has not yet commenced. the expected lease obligations are approximately $232.5 million which will be paid over an expected lease term of 15 years. this operating lease will commence in fiscal year 2022. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 14, "operating leases" for sublease information.
(3)   in the ordinary course of business, invesco enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of invesco. purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent fixed-price contracts, which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. at december 31, 2019, the company's obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services. in addition, the company is a party to certain variable-price contractual arrangements (e.g. contingent future payments based on aum levels, number of accounts, transaction volume, etc.) for which the company is reimbursed by affiliated funds and as such are not included in the table above. purchase obligations are recorded as liabilities in the company's consolidated financial statements when services are provided. purchase obligations also include contingent consideration liabilities.
67
during the year ended december 31, 2019, the company entered into three forward contracts to repurchase $500.0 million of shares as part of its announced $1.2 billion common stock buyback program. at december 31, 2019 the payable was $496.5 million and is included in other liabilities. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 10, "share capital" for additional details.
(4)   the company has capital commitments into co-invested funds that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified. at december 31, 2019, the company's undrawn capital and purchase commitments were $357.0 million. these are not included in the above table. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 19, "commitments and contingencies" for additional details.
(5)   due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2019, the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. therefore, $69.9 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 16 - "taxation" for a discussion regarding income taxes.
(6)   in addition to the contractual obligations in the table above, we periodically make contributions to defined benefit pension plans. for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 we contributed $24.0 million and $21.2 million, respectively, to these plans. in 2020, we expect to contribute $24.9 million to our defined benefit pension plans. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 13, "retirement benefit plans" for detailed benefit pension plan information. the company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above.
(7) in addition to the contractual obligations in the table above, and pursuant to an agreement entered into at the consummation of the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds, massmutual, as the holder of seed capital investments in certain funds and accounts included in the acquisition, has the right to redeem its seed capital investments in accordance with an agreed upon schedule.  in the event massmutual exercises its redemption rights and the applicable fund or account is unable to meet such redemption (for example, due to illiquid investments or the need to maintain a level of investment in the fund), the company would be required to fund such redemption to massmutual and seek reimbursement from the applicable fund or account at a later time when the fund or account is able to fulfill a redemption request. at december 31, 2019, the total amount of seed capital subject to this agreement is approximately $625 million. since december 31, 2019, massmutual exercised its redemption rights and redeemed a portion of the seed capital per the agreed upon schedule. as of the date of this report, the company was not required to fund these redemptions nor does the company anticipate having to fund any of the seed capital subject to this agreement.
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are disclosed in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 1, "accounting policies." the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made. these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below; however, the additional accounting policy detail in the footnote previously referenced is important to the discussion of each of the topics. different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these consolidated financial statements, and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from period-to-period in the future.
goodwill our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2019 and 2018 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit more likely than not exceeded its carrying value. during 2019, the optional qualitative approach indicated that a quantitative assessment of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary; whereas, during 2018 management elected to proceed directly to a quantitative goodwill impairment test. the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled $8,509.4 million and $7,157.1 million at december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, respectively. such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the company's aum, or any other material negative change in aum and related effective fee rates.
68
when management utilizes the option to first assess goodwill impairment on a qualitative basis, the totality of certain events and circumstances are assessed to determine if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. such events and circumstances include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance of the company, and or significant changes in share price. if the qualitative assessment indicates that an impairment may be likely or management elected to not perform the qualitative assessment, management performs a quantitative test to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. the fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment, including aum growth rates, projected effective fee rates, pre-tax profit margins, effective tax rates and discount rates.
the quantitative test includes assumptions updated for current market conditions, including the company's updated forecasts for changes in aum due to market gains or losses and long-term net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses. market gains are based upon historical returns of the s&p 500 index, treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns, as applicable to the company's aum mix on the testing date. the most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value. the discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently from period to period. while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate, changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments.
intangible assets where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company, the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. similar to goodwill, management has the option to first assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e. the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset). in addition, management's judgment is required to estimate the period over which definite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the company's cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a definite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the company's amortization expense, which was $52.7 million, $29.7 million and $17.4 million for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. if a quantitative assessment is required, the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. if required, fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment, including aum growth rates, product mix, projected effective fee rates, pre-tax profit margins, effective tax rates and discount rates. the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the aum growth rate and discount rate, which is a weighted average cost of capital including consideration of company size premiums. changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions. during 2019 and 2018, our annual impairment reviews of indefinite-lived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates, the classifications of indefinite-lived and definite-lived remain appropriate, and no changes to the expected lives of the definite-lived intangible assets were required.
in may 2019, the company acquired massmutual's asset management affiliate, oppenheimerfunds, for total consideration of approximately $5.6 billion comprised of cash and stock. the resulting synergy further enhances the company's ability to meet client needs through its comprehensive range of high-conviction active, passive and alternative capabilities.
management applied a significant amount of judgment when developing the fair value measurement of the management fee contracts intangible assets. fair value was determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows were discounted to arrive at present value amounts. see note , "accounting policies" and note , "business combination" to the consolidated financial statements for further information surrounding the estimates of identified assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and consideration transferred. also see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for the company's acquisition policy.
the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including, but not limited to, (i) the future aum growth rates for different product categories and their related net flows and market appreciation; (ii) projected effective fee rates; (iii) pre-tax profit margins; (iv) the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets; and (v) discount rate.

cip assessing if an entity is a variable interest entity (vie) or voting interest entity (voe) involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity, the company's contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company's involvement with the entity. a vie, in the context of the company and its managed funds, is a fund that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support, or a fund for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests. if the company is deemed to have the power to direct the activities of the fund that most significantly impact the fund's economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses/right to receive benefits from the fund that could potentially be significant to the fund, then the company is deemed to be the fund's primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the fund.
determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie also requires significant judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the fund's economic results and to assess if the company's interests could be deemed significant. if current financial statements are not available for consolidated vies or voes, estimation of investment valuation is required, which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data. significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by cip and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheets and the other gains and losses of cip, net, and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, net, amounts on the consolidated statements of income.
as of december 31, 2019, the company consolidated cip that held investments of $7,808.0 million (december 31, 2018: $6,213.5 million).
contingencies contingencies arise when we have a present obligation as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable. we must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies. the nature of our business requires compliance with various laws and regulations, as well as various contractual obligations, and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business. while the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, we maintain reserves reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses, as appropriate, for identified losses that are, in our judgment, probable and reasonably estimable. we expense any related legal fees as they are incurred. management's judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel, ruling on various motions by the applicable court, review of the outcome of similar matters, if applicable, and review of guidance from governmental and other regulatory authorities, if applicable. contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business.

item 1a. risk factors.
described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. each of the following risk factors should carefully be considered in conjunction with other information provided in this annual report on form 10-k and in our other public disclosures. the risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing and, consequently, the market value of our common stock and debt instruments. these risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. the risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. there may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. all forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below.
we face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability.
while we constantly strive to offer consumers the best value, the retail sector is highly competitive. price is of great importance to most customers, and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. the ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. we compete with many other local, regional, national and international retailers and technology service providers, as well as some of our vendors and mobile network carriers that market their products directly to consumers. competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve, offering products and/or services that compete with us.
the retail sector continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications, and some online-only businesses have lower operating costs. online and multi-channel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, with customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure might be higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, could put pressure on our margins. as these and related competitive factors evolve, we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability.
our strategy to expand into new products, services and technologies brings new business, financial and regulatory risks.
as we introduce new products and services, using new technologies and applications, we may have limited experience in these newer markets and regulatory environments and our customers may not like our new value propositions. these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions, failures or other issues. for example, as our value proposition evolves to support the healthcare industry with technology, we may be subject to privacy and information security rules, such as the health insurance portability and accountability act, and/or subject to increased potential liability risk.
this expanded risk increases the complexity of our business and places significant responsibility on our management, employees, operations, systems, technical expertise, financial resources, and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions. in addition, new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected, which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. they may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current expertise.
in fiscal 2020, we continued to invest in our health strategy and our underlying purpose to enrich lives through technology. the new health-related services offered might expose us to liability risk resulting from failures in the fulfillment of these services. in addition, the services and systems used could expose us to customer data privacy and information security risks, as well as business or system interruption risks. these and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
our focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation.
we offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings, including consultation, delivery, design, installation, memberships, protection plans, repair, set-up, technical support, and health, safety and caregiving monitoring and support. designing, marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks. these risks include, for example:
• increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises;
• pressure on traditional labor models to meet the evolving landscape of offerings and customer needs;
• increased risk of errors or omissions in the fulfillment of services;
• unpredictable extended warranty failure rates and related expenses;
• employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes, which may increase our scope of liability;
• the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings;
• employees having access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and privacy of the data they hold;
• the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation, and the potential responsibility for the actions they undertake;
• the risk that in-home services could be more adversely impacted by inclement weather, health and safety concerns, and catastrophic events; and
• increased risk of non-compliance with new laws and regulations applicable to these services.
we are subject to risks associated with company transformation.
our transformational activities within the organization are necessary to fully support our strategic vision for future customer and income growth, including our building the new blue strategy, and any decreased capability to undertake those activities may have a material impact on achieving that strategy.
any limitations in organizational, financial or operational infrastructure could decrease our ability to realize transformational objectives supporting our key strategic initiatives relating to our development of competitive advantages, creating solutions for customers and providing differentiated value. if we do not have access to, or fail to dedicate, the appropriate people, management focus and resources to implementing these transformational objectives, our long-term growth and profitability could be adversely affected.
our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability.
we source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. in fiscal 2020, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 79% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers - apple, samsung, hewlett-packard, sony and lg - representing approximately 56% of total merchandise purchased. we generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. our profitability depends on our securing acceptable terms with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties. while we believe we offer capabilities that these vendors value and depend upon to varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages - for example, their financial strength, the strength of their brands with customers, their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers - to our commercial disadvantage. the potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. generally, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues and/or when there is less competition. in addition, vendors may decide to limit or cease allowing us to offer certain categories, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our financial or other terms.
we are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. the competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business, especially with ongoing consolidation in the mobile industry. for example, if carriers change the structure of contracts, upgrade terms, qualification requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. in addition, our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels.
if we fail to attract, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operations and profitability may be harmed. changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability.
our performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores, service centers, distribution centers, field and corporate offices. our strategy of offering high-quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. the turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee engagement, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers, availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages. failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. in addition, a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations.
we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation and employer-provided benefits could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. market increases to employee hourly wage rates, increased cost pressure on employer-provided benefits, and our ability to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and compensation and benefit packages could have a material impact to the profitability of our business.
we are subject to statutory, regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
our statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face include, but are not limited to:
• the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;
• the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials;
• the challenges of ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulations related to product safety and product transport;
• the financial, operational and business impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security, such as the california consumer privacy act ("ccpa");
• the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations, including, but not limited to, financial reform; national labor relations board rule changes; healthcare reform; contracted worker labor laws; corporate governance matters; escheatment rules; rules governing pricing, content, distribution, copyright, mobile communications, electronic device certification or payment services; and/or other as yet unknown legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;
• the impact of litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters; and
• the impact of the general election on the development, or changes in, laws, regulations and policies.
with respect to the ccpa, which came into effect on january 1, 2020, the statute provides new privacy rights for california residents and requires companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers, allowing them to opt out of certain uses of their personal information. in addition, the california attorney general has issued proposed rules under the ccpa. we cannot predict the impact of this first-of-its-kind statute and these rules that have not yet been finalized, in addition to potential privacy and security legislation in other states and the u.s. federal level, on our business or operations, but these legislative initiatives may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, interfere with intended business operations or lead us to incur incremental expenses in an effort to comply.
the impact of the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies, higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the u.s. or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products could have a material adverse effect on our business. in particular, future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with china could lead to the imposition of tariffs that could adversely affect our supply chain and our business and could require us to take action to mitigate those effects, as we did in fiscal 2020.
further, the impact of potential changes in u.s. or other countries' tax laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws, including additional guidance and legislation related to the tax cuts and jobs act, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
regulatory activity that affects the retail sector has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance. additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management's attention and resources from other matters.
macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, the effects of novel coronavirus disease ("covid 19") may adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results.
to varying degrees, our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. as a result, consumers may be affected in many different ways, including, for example:
• whether or not they make a purchase;
• their choice of brand, model or price-point;
• how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices; and
• their appetite for complementary services (for example, protection plans).
real gdp growth, consumer confidence, the covid-19 pandemic discussed in the following risk factor, inflation, employment levels, oil prices, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services that we offer. geopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned can also impact the macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
the impact of covid-19 is expected to adversely affect our business and our financial results.
concerns have rapidly grown regarding the outbreak of covid-19. as the pandemic continues to grow, consumer fear about becoming ill with the virus and recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state and local authorities to avoid large gatherings of people or self-quarantine have increased, which will adversely affect traffic to our stores. in particular, we recently announced a shift to enhanced curbside service only for all of our stores on an interim basis. further, all in-home installation and repair has been temporarily suspended and all in-home consultations are being conducted virtually. the significant reduction in customer visits to, and spending at, our stores caused by covid-19 will likely result in a loss of sales and profits and other material adverse effects. we may further restrict the operations of our stores and distribution facilities if we deem this necessary or if recommended or mandated by authorities and these measures could have a further material impact on our sales and profits. also, if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate for a particular region or our company as a whole, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our business in the future.
covid-19 also impacted our supply chain for products we sell, particularly as a result of mandatory shutdowns in locations where our products are manufactured. we could also see significant disruptions to our supply chain in the u.s. as well as significant deterioration in macroeconomic factors that typically affect us, such as consumer spending.
in addition, we expect to incur significant costs in our response to the pandemic, including, but not limited to, costs incurred to implement the operational changes described above and certain payments to or other costs relating to employees who are not working during the pandemic.
the extent of the impact of covid-19 on our business and financial results will also depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak within the markets in which we operate and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain.
failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
as discussed above, our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources, which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues. however, some of our operating costs are fixed and/or are subject to multi-year contracts. some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors' because of, for example, our extended retail footprint and structure, our differential service offerings or our levels of customer service. accordingly, our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative. failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives.
we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business.
the effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors. we rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, point-of-sale processing, services fulfillment, staff planning and deployment, financial management, reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information.
our information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks and other malicious actions), catastrophic events (such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes) and usage errors by our employees. the failure or interruption of these information systems, data centers or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation.
our information technology systems could also be adversely affected by changes that result from covid-19, including for example, a significant increase in remote working of our employees and an increase in online orders due to restrictions on our retail operations.
we also utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications. if we fail to secure these systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware, software, network and system infrastructure and improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions and delays. disruptions to these services, such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels, malicious attacks, other technical difficulties or events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data, could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders for products or services, which could cause us to forgo material revenues, incur material costs and adversely affect our reputation.
failure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer, employee, vendor or company information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage, as well as litigation and enforcement actions.
our business involves the collection, use and storage of personal information, including payment card information, as well as confidential information regarding our employees, vendors and other company information. we also share personal and confidential information with suppliers and other third parties, as well as use third-party technology and systems which transmit information for a variety of activities. we have been the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats, and we may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems. while we engage in significant data-protection efforts, criminal activity, such as cyber-attacks, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties, may undermine our privacy and security measures, and, as a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee, customer and other confidential data, or authorized parties may use or share personal information in an inappropriate manner. furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them. any compromise of our customer information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our customers and partners, which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs, penalties and claims.
sensitive customer data may also be present on customer-owned devices entrusted to us for service and repair. vulnerable code on products sold or serviced, including our exclusive brands, may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security. our efforts to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture, sell and service may not be effective, resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships.
increasing costs associated with information security and privacy, such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff, costs of compliance, costs resulting from fraud, and costs of cyber and privacy insurance, could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. additionally, new laws, such as the ccpa, are expanding our obligations to protect the privacy and security of customer data, requiring additional resources and creating incremental risk arising from a potential breach. in addition, any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk.
failure to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business.
we may decide to enter into new joint ventures, partnerships, alliances or acquisitions with third parties (collectively, "new ventures"). assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors, including, for example:
• different and incremental business risks of the new venture not identified in our diligence assessments;
• failure to motivate and retain key employees of the new venture;
• uncertainty of forecasting financial performance;
• failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business, such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems;
• failure to maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting;
• failure to generate expected synergies, such as cost reductions;
• unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture;
• disputes or strategic differences with other third-party participants in the new venture; and
• adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture.
if new ventures are unsuccessful, our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired. new ventures may also divert our financial resources and management's attention from other important areas of our business.
we are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.
a large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the u.s., canada and mexico. in addition, the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors, such as the level of competitive promotional activity, new product release activity and customer buying patterns, which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly. unexpected events or developments, such as natural or man-made disasters, changes in consumer demand, economic factors, product sourcing issues, cyber-attacks, failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third-party vendors could significantly disrupt our operations. as a result of these factors, there is a risk that our fiscal fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected.
many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement, product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences.
we operate in a highly and increasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technology innovation and disruption. this manifests itself in a variety of ways: the emergence of new products and categories, rapid maturation of categories, cannibalization of categories, declining price points and product replacement and upgrade cycles.
this rapid pace of change can be hard to predict and manage, and there is no guarantee we can effectively do this all the time. if we fail to interpret, predict and react to these changes in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include: failure to offer the products and services that our customers want; having excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation; inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply; delays in adapting our merchandising, marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and damage to our brand and reputation. these and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.
economic, regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs.
we offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low- or no-interest financing on qualifying purchases. we believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases. approximately 25% of our fiscal 2020 revenue was transacted using one of the company's branded cards. in addition, we earn profit-share income and share in any losses from certain of our banking partners based on the performance of the programs. the income or loss we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors, including the volume and value of transactions, the terms of promotional financing offers, bad debt rates, interest rates, the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program. adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs.
interruptions and other factors affecting our supply chain, including in-bound deliveries from our vendors, may adversely affect our business.
our supply chain is a critical part of our operations, particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives, such as ship-from-store and the emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online. we depend on our vendors' abilities to deliver products to us at the right location, right time and in the right quantities. we also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network. the factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include, but are not limited to:
• interruptions to our delivery capabilities;
• failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments;
• disruptions to our systems and the need to implement new systems;
• limitations in capacity;
• consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors;
• labor strikes or slow-downs impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain;
• diseases, pandemics (including covid-19), outbreaks and other health-related concerns, which have resulted in and could continue to result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;
• damages or other loss to products; and
• increasing transportation costs.
it is important that we maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands. any disruption to, or inefficiency in, our supply chain network could damage our revenue and profitability. the risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business. the continuing growth of online purchases for delivery increases our exposure to these risks. if we fail to manage these risks effectively, we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue and profitability.
catastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results.
the risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. such events may be caused by, for example:
• natural disasters or extreme weather events;
• diseases or pandemics (including covid-19) that have affected and may continue to affect our employees, customers or partners;
• floods, fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties, employees or customers; or
• terrorism, civil unrest, mass violence or violent acts, or other conflicts.
in recent years, we have observed an increase in the number and severity of certain events in many of our markets. such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network. they can also affect our information technology systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders. as a consequence of these or other catastrophic events, we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.
demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition through a focused consumer experience approach.
we operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. we believe that recognition and the reputation of our company and our brands are key to our success. operational factors, such as failure to deliver high quality services, uncompetitive pricing, failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions, could damage our reputation. external factors, such as negative public remarks or accusations, could also be damaging. the ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in, among other things, declines in revenues and customer loyalty, decreases in gift card and service plan sales, lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues, all of which could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability.
product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.
if the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety and quality, we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged. failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches of laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation. recalls of products, particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or our difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products, could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.
changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model.
as an employer of nearly 125,000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including, for example:
• the organization of unions and related regulations that affect the nature of labor relations, changes to which the national labor relations board continually considers;
• laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors; and
• laws that impact minimum wage, sick time, paid leave and scheduling requirements could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide.
changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to continue operations and our profitability.
failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results.
effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our multi-channel strategy. failure to identify and secure suitable locations for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability. most of our properties are leased, of which some are subject to long-term leases. as such, it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our long-term real estate strategy. such factors include, for example:
• changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving multi-channel environment;
• the location and appropriate number of stores in our portfolio;
• the interior layout, format and size of our stores;
• the products and services we offer at each store;
• the local competitive positioning, trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores;
• the primary term lease commitment and long-term lease option coverage for each store;
• the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents; and
• our supply chain service location network strategy.
if we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example:
• closing stores and abandoning the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the leases;
• incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores;
• operating stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and
• bearing excessive lease expenses.
these consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.
for leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. it is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. in addition to rent, we are still responsible for taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. similarly, when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee. this leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sub-lease tenant.
constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.
we need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. the principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables. our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. if our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. the future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions, the availability of credit, our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing, our ability to pursue business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.
changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs.
any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets, borrowing costs, vendor terms and lease terms. our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies.
we utilize third-party vendors for certain aspects of our operations, and any material disruption in our relationship or their services might have an impact to our business.
we engage key third-party business partners to support various functions of our business, including, but not limited to, information technology, web hosting and cloud-based services, human resource operations, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, gift cards, customer warranty, delivery and installation, technical support, transportation and insurance programs. any material disruption in our relationship with key third-party business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations, particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods.
our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results.
sales of our exclusive brands products, which include dynex, insignia, modal, platinum and rocketfish branded products, as well as other products such as jitterbug, lively mobile and lively mobile plus, represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability. most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast asia. this arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results:
• we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brand product defects, and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions;
• we may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive brand products, some of which may require us to take significant actions, such as product recalls;
• we have experienced and are likely to continue to experience disruptions in manufacturing and logistics due to covid-19, and we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics in the future due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key manufacturers, other diseases or pandemics or unforeseen natural disasters;
• we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brand products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;
• we may be subject to a greater risk of inventory obsolescence as we do not generally have return to vendor rights;
• we are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;
• we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brand products;
• our operations may be disrupted by trade disputes or excessive tariffs, including any future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with china, and we may not be able to source alternatives quickly enough to avoid interruptions in product supply;
• we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brand products or manufacturing processes; and
• regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of "conflict minerals" in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and, depending on the findings of our country of origin inquiry, could have an adverse effect on our reputation.
maintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brand products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty, generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins. failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the profits we are able to generate from them.
we are subject to risks associated with vendors that source products outside of the u.s.
our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our internal standards of quality and safety can be difficult, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the u.s. risks such as political or economic instability, cross-border trade restrictions or tariffs, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, work stoppages, port delays, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics (including covid-19) and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. vendors may also fail to invest adequately in design, production or distribution facilities, and may reduce their customer incentives, advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies. these and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above, as well as to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, regulatory, political, economic and cultural factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate.
we operate retail locations in canada and mexico. in addition, most of our exclusive brand products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast asia. we also have wholly owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries, including barbados, bermuda, china, hong kong, luxembourg, the republic of mauritius and the u.k. during fiscal 2020, our international segment's operations generated 8% of our revenue. in general, the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our international operations. in addition, our international operations also expose us to other risks, including those related to, for example:
• political conditions and geopolitical events, including war and terrorism;
• economic conditions, including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules, as well as foreign exchange rate risk;
• rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign entities;
• government-imposed travel restrictions or warnings, whether in response to the covid-19 pandemic or otherwise, and differing responses of governmental authorities to pandemics and other global events;
• cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately;
• different rules or practices regarding employee relations, including the existence of works councils or unions;
• difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; and
• difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations.
these factors could significantly disrupt our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead us to incur material impairments and other exit costs.
failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price.
we may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forward-looking information for future periods. although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management's expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential shareholders, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided. we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate and profit margins. we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. a significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease. our revenue and operating profit growth depend on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. if our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of market participants, or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. unless otherwise noted, transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude. our md&a is presented in the following sections:
• overview
• business strategy
• results of operations
• liquidity and capital resources
• critical accounting estimates
• new accounting pronouncements our md&a should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k.
in march 2019, the sec adopted the final rule under sec release no. 33-10618, fast act modernization and simplification of regulation s-k ("fast act"). the amendment aims to modernize and simplify certain reporting requirements and improve readability and navigability between disclosures. on adoption of this amendment, we omitted analysis of the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended february 2, 2019, in comparison to the year ended february 3, 2018. for such omitted disclosures, refer to item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended february 2, 2019, filed with the sec on march 28, 2019, which item 7 is incorporated by reference herein.
overview our purpose is to enrich the lives of consumers through technology. we have two reportable segments: domestic and international. the domestic segment is comprised of the operations in all states, districts and territories of the u.s. under various brand names including best buy, best buy business, best buy express, best buy health, cst, geek squad, greatcall, lively, magnolia and pacific kitchen and home and the domain names bestbuy.com and greatcall.com. the international segment is comprised of all operations in canada and mexico under the brand names best buy, best buy express, best buy mobile and geek squad and the domain names bestbuy.ca and bestbuy.com.mx.
our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest the end of january. fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 included 52 weeks, while fiscal 2018 included 53 weeks with the additional week occurring in the fiscal fourth quarter. our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. a large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the u.s., canada and mexico.
comparable sales throughout this md&a, we refer to comparable sales. in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we refined our methodology for calculating comparable sales. it now reflects certain revenue streams previously excluded from the comparable sales calculation, such as credit card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers, as applicable. the impact of adopting these changes is immaterial to all periods presented, and therefore prior-period comparable sales disclosures have not been restated. our comparable sales calculation compares revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months, as well as revenue related to certain other comparable sales channels for a particular period to the corresponding period in the prior year. relocated stores, as well as remodeled, expanded and downsized stores closed more than 14 days, are excluded from the comparable sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. acquisitions are included in the comparable sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. the calculation of comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (applicable to our international segment only). the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. as a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers' methods.
on march 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining best buy mobile stand-alone stores in the u.s. as a result, all revenue related to these stores has been excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in march 2018. on october 1, 2018, we acquired all outstanding shares of greatcall, inc. ("greatcall") and on may 9, 2019, we acquired all outstanding shares of critical signal technologies, inc. ("cst"). consistent with our comparable sales policy, the results of greatcall are included in our comparable sales calculation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, and the results of cst are excluded from our comparable sales calculation for the periods presented.
non-gaap financial measures this md&a includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap"), as well as certain adjusted or non-gaap financial measures, such as constant currency, non-gaap operating income, non-gaap effective tax rate and non-gaap diluted earnings per share ("eps") from continuing operations. we believe that non-gaap financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with gaap financial measures, can provide more information to assist investors in evaluating current period performance and in assessing future performance. for these reasons, our internal management reporting also includes non-gaap financial measures. generally, our non-gaap financial measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges, goodwill impairments, gains and losses on investments, intangible asset amortization, certain acquisition-related costs and the tax effect of all such items. in addition, certain other items may be excluded from non-gaap financial measures when we believe doing so provides greater clarity to management and our investors. these non-gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, gaap financial measures. we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. non-gaap financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
in our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our international segment, we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the international segment's operating results from local currencies into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes. we also may use the term "constant currency," which represents results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts. we calculate those impacts as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates. we believe the disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates.
refer to the non-gaap financial measures section below for the detailed reconciliation of items that impacted non-gaap operating income, non-gaap effective tax rate and non-gaap diluted eps from continuing operations in the presented periods.
business strategy in fiscal 2020, we grew our enterprise comparable sales by 2.1% on top of 4.8% in fiscal 2019, which represents our sixth consecutive year of positive enterprise comparable sales. we also increased gaap diluted eps by 10.6% to $5.75 and increased our non-gaap diluted eps by 14.1% to $6.07. in addition, we recorded annual revenue of $43.6 billion, gaap operating income of $2.0 billion and non-gaap operating income of $2.1 billion in fiscal 2020. compared to fiscal 2019, our fiscal 2020 gaap and non-gaap operating income as a percentage of revenue increased approximately 20 basis points and approximately 30 basis points, respectively. from a capital allocation standpoint, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
we continue to make progress on our building the new blue strategy and our purpose to enrich lives through technology. our strategy is to leverage our unique combination of tech and touch to meet every day human needs and build more and deeper relationships with customers. we believe our strategy will translate to an economic model that delivers results by better serving existing customers, capturing new demand, entering new spaces and building capabilities while maintaining profitability over time.
during fiscal 2020 we continued to expand our total tech support program, ending fiscal 2020 with almost 2.3 million members. having a service that provides members unlimited geek squad support for all their technology no matter where or when they bought it, is a compelling value proposition for our members. we also expanded our in-home advisor program from 530 advisors to approximately 720 advisors and provided more than 250,000 free, in-home consultations to customers across the nation. in health, we continued to advance our initiatives designed to help seniors live longer in their homes with the help of technology. we successfully integrated acquisitions that have given us the capabilities, infrastructure, talent and a base of customer relationships to build from. we continued to elevate the customer experience around product fulfillment, enabled by the advancement of our supply chain transformation. in parallel to the customer experience work, we continued to drive efficiencies and reduce costs in order to fund investments and offset pressures.
in addition to these accomplishments, we are proud of our progress in advancing our corporate social responsibility and sustainability efforts. in fact, we were named to the top 5 on barron's annual "100 most sustainable companies" list for the third consecutive year.
in september 2019, we set three fiscal 2025 targets focused on employees, customers and financials, which are:
to be one of the best companies to work for in the u.s., exemplified by being named to fortune's "100 best companies" to work for list;
to double the number of significant customer relationship events to 50 million, which includes total tech support memberships, homes visited, active digital engagement, customers using our financial services offerings and senior lives supported; and
to deliver continued top- and bottom-line growth over time, specifically to get to $50 billion in revenue and a 5.0% non-gaap operating income rate in fiscal 2025.
looking to the future, our priorities will look to build upon our momentum and remain focused on achieving our fiscal 2025 targets. we will continue to bring our deep consumer electronics expertise and ability to partner with vendors to commercialize their new technology, offering customers great products and solutions. our priorities will also include increasing our total tech support member base, growing our health business and continuing to expand our in-home advisor program. we will also continue to innovate and design multi-channel experiences that solve customer needs across our website, app and other channels in ways that enhance the experience across online and physical shopping and continue with our supply chain transformation, including using automation and process improvements to expand fulfillment options, increase delivery speed and improve delivery and installation. in addition, as has been our brand over the last several years, we will strive to keep driving cost reductions and efficiencies throughout the business.
impact of covid-19
we are closely monitoring the impact of covid-19 on all aspects of our business and in all of our locations. we are making the best decisions we can with two goals in mind: protecting employees, customers and their respective families, while trying our best to serve our customers who rely on us for increasingly vital technology. we have seen increased demand for products that people need to work or learn from home, as well as those products that allow people to refrigerate or freeze food. as we meet the demand for these necessities, we are adjusting how we operate in many ways to improve safety. for example, except where otherwise directed by state and local authorities, on march 22, 2020, we shifted to enhanced curbside service only for all of our u.s. stores on an interim basis. customers can also still order online or via the best buy app and have their products shipped directly to their homes. large products, such as appliances, will be delivered where permitted and under strict safety guidelines with doorstep drop-off deliveries only. all in-home installation and repair has been temporarily suspended and all in-home consultations are being conducted virtually. we may further restrict the operations of our stores and distribution facilities and these measures could have a material impact on our revenues and profits. covid-19 could also lead to significant disruption to our supply chain for products we sell and could trigger a significant deterioration in macroeconomic factors that typically affect us, such as consumer spending.
all best buy employees have been told they do not have to work if they do not feel comfortable and to stay home if they are feeling sick, knowing they will be paid. all field employees whose hours have been eliminated will be paid for two weeks at their normal wage rate based on their average hours worked over the last 10 weeks.
it is not possible to predict the likelihood, timing or severity of the aforementioned direct and indirect impacts of covid-19 on our business. in light of the uncertainty in this fluid environment, on march 19, 2020, we drew the full amount of our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility and temporarily suspended all share repurchases.
tariffs during fiscal 2020, we worked to actively address the risks related to increases to tariff rates and proposed new tariffs on chinese imports. in may 2019, the u.s. trade representative ("ustr") increased the tariff on list 3 products imported from china from 10% to 25%, effective june 15, 2019. the ustr also implemented a list 4 tariff of 15% on additional products imported from china. the list 4 tariffs had two effective dates. the first effective date (list 4a) was september 1, 2019, and the most notable affected categories relative to best buy on this list are televisions, smart watches and headphones. the second effective date (list 4b) was december 15, 2019, and the most notable affected categories relative to best buy on this list are computing, mobile phones and gaming consoles. on january 15, 2020, the u.s. and china completed a "phase one" trade agreement. under the agreement, list 4a tariffs were reduced from 15% to 7.5%, effective 30 days later. list 4b tariffs were suspended indefinitely and list 1-3 tariffs of 25% were maintained. there was no timeline given for additional phases (or tariff actions) to begin or to be concluded. throughout fiscal 2020, we were able to minimize the impact of tariffs on our business by accelerating purchases and working with our vendors, some of which are in the process of migrating their manufacturing out of china, factoring tariffs into our product assortment decisions, promotional and pricing strategies, sourcing changes and other strategies in partnership with our vendors. however, future trade disputes with china or future phases of trade negotiations between the u.s. and china could lead to the imposition of new tariffs or other adverse consequences for our business.
results of operations in order to align our fiscal reporting periods and comply with statutory filing requirements, we consolidate the financial results of our mexico operations on a one-month lag. consistent with such consolidation, the financial and non-financial information presented in our md&a relative to these operations is also presented on a lag. our policy is to accelerate the recording of events occurring in the lag period that significantly affect our consolidated financial statements. no such events were identified for the periods presented.

revenue, gross profit rate, sg&a rate and operating income rate changes in fiscal 2020 were primarily driven by our domestic segment. for further discussion of each segment's rate changes, see segment performance summary, below.

(1)comparable online sales are included in the comparable sales calculation. comparable sales also exclude the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018. on march 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining best buy mobile stand-alone stores in the u.s. as a result, all revenue related to these stores has been excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in march 2018. on october 1, 2018, we acquired all outstanding shares of greatcall and on may 9, 2019, we acquired all outstanding shares of cst. consistent with our comparable sales policy, the results of greatcall are included in our comparable sales calculation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, and the results of cst are excluded from our comparable sales calculation for the periods presented.
the increase in revenue in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by the comparable sales growth of 2.3% and revenue from greatcall prior to its inclusion in comparable sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. these increases were partially offset by the loss of revenue from store closures. online revenue increased in fiscal 2020 due to higher average order values, higher conversion rates and increased traffic.

our non-gaap operating income increased $137 million in fiscal 2020, primarily driven by strong revenue performance in our domestic segment in nearly all product categories and a decrease in sg&a, primarily due to lower incentive compensation. the increase in non-gaap operating income resulted in a year-over-year increase in non-gaap diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020, which also benefited from a lower weighted-average diluted share count from share repurchases. our non-gaap effective tax rate decreased in fiscal 2020, primarily due to increased tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the resolution of discrete tax matters.
liquidity and capital resources summary we closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment required to support our business strategies, the performance of our business, capital expenditures, credit facilities, short-term borrowing arrangements and working capital management. capital expenditures and share repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment. we have a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our strategy.

2020                                                                                    2019                    2018
total cash provided by (used in):

operating activities the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to changes in working capital, primarily due to the timing of receipts and payments on inventory, the timing of deliveries of inventory to customers, increased earnings and lower incentive compensation payments due to a special one-time incentive payment in fiscal 2019. this was partially offset by the timing of collections on receivables and the timing of tax payments.
investing activities the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to decreases in sales and increases in purchases of investments, partially offset by a decrease in cash used in the acquisitions of cst and biosensics in fiscal 2020 compared to the acquisition of greatcall in fiscal 2019.
financing activities the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in shares repurchased during fiscal 2020 and the repayment in fiscal 2019 of our $500 million principal amount of notes due august 1, 2018. this was partially offset by the issuance in fiscal 2019 of our $500 million principal amount of notes due october 1, 2028.
sources of liquidity funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, our credit facilities and other debt arrangements are our most significant sources of liquidity. we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and strategic initiatives, including business combinations. however, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending. there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms.
we have a $1.25 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "facility") with a syndicate of banks that expires in april 2023. there were no borrowings under the facility during fiscal 2020. on march 19, 2020, we drew down the full amount of the facility to increase our cash position and maximize flexibility in light of the uncertainty surrounding the impact of covid-19. refer to note 6, debt, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
our ability to continue to access the facility is subject to our compliance with its terms and conditions, including financial covenants. the financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios. at february 1, 2020, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. if an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt, it would likely constitute an event of default under our facility as well.
our credit ratings and outlook at march 18, 2020, are summarized below. on october 30, 2019, fitch affirmed its bbb rating and withdrew all future ratings for commercial reasons. on march 9, 2020, moody's concluded their review for upgrade that was initiated on november 20, 2019, and confirmed its current rating of baa1 and changed its outlook to stable from rating under review. standard & poor's rating and outlook remained unchanged from the prior year.
rating agency           rating   outlook standard &amp; poor's   bbb      stable moody's                 baa1     stable credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically, and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to review at any time. factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. if further changes in our credit ratings were to occur, they could impact, among other things, interest costs for certain of our credit facilities, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new-store leasing costs.
restricted cash our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for workers' compensation and general liability insurance claims. restricted cash, which is included in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets, was $126 million and $204 million at february 1, 2020, and february 2, 2019, respectively. the decrease was due to a dividend of excess cash from our wholly-owned insurance captive that manages a portion of our self-insured claims.
capital expenditures our capital expenditures typically include investments in our stores, distribution capabilities and information technology enhancements (including e-commerce). capital expenditures were as follows ($ in millions):
2020                                                  2019              2018

supply chain                                 74               107                66
total capital expenditures(2)              $743              $819              $688
(1)includes store remodels and various merchandising projects.
(2)total capital expenditures exclude non-cash capital expenditures of $10 million, $53 million and $123 million for fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. non-cash capital expenditures are comprised of capitalized leases, as well as additions to property and equipment included in accounts payable.
debt and capital as of february 1, 2020, we had $650 million principal amount of notes due march 15, 2021 ("2021 notes"), and $500 million principal amount of notes due october 1, 2028 ("2028 notes"), outstanding. refer to note 6, debt, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
share repurchases and dividends we repurchase our common stock and pay dividends pursuant to programs approved by our board of directors ("board"). the payment of cash dividends is also subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. our long-term capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investments in growth and then return excess cash over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics.
on february 23, 2019, our board authorized a $3.0 billion share repurchase program. as of february 1, 2020, $2.0 billion of the $3.0 billion share repurchase authorization was available. between the end of fiscal 2020 on february 1, 2020, and march 18, 2020, we repurchased an incremental 0.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $56 million. we have since temporarily suspended all share repurchases.
share repurchase and dividend activity were as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):
2020                                                         2019                2018
total cost of shares repurchased                $1,009              $1,493              $2,009
average price per share                         $72.34              $70.28              $57.16
total number of shares repurchased                14.0                21.2                35.1
regular quarterly cash dividends per share       $2.00                1.80               $1.36
cash dividends declared and paid                  $527                 497                $409
dividends declared and paid increased in fiscal 2020 due to an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividends per share, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding due to the return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases.
on february 27, 2020, our board authorized a 10% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.55 per share, effective immediately.
other financial measures our current ratio, calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities, was 1.1 as of february 1, 2020, compared to 1.2 as of february 2, 2019. our debt to earnings ratio, calculated as total debt (including current portion) divided by net earnings from continuing operations, was 0.8 as of february 1, 2020, compared to 0.9 as of february 2, 2019. the decline in both ratios was primarily due to the adoption of new lease accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 that resulted in the recognition of operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet. refer to note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, and note 10, leases, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k, for additional information regarding this adoption.
off-balance-sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we do not have outstanding off-balance-sheet arrangements. contractual obligations as of february 1, 2020, were as follows ($ in millions):
payments due by period contractual obligations                       total           less than               1-3 years             3-5 years             more than

note: for additional information refer to note 5, derivative instruments; note 6, debt; note 10, leases; note 11, income taxes; and note 13, contingencies and commitments, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k.
(1)represents principal amounts only and excludes interest rate swap valuation adjustments.
(2)interest payments related to our 2021 notes and 2028 notes include the variable interest rate payments included in our interest rate swap.
(3)lease obligations exclude $158 million of legally binding fixed costs for leases signed but not yet commenced.
(4)operating lease obligations exclude payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance. these charges, if included, would increase total operating lease obligations by $0.7 billion at february 1, 2020.
(5)purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty. additionally, although they do not contain legally binding purchase commitments, we included open purchase orders in the table above. substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days.
(6)unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions. as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time, the related balances have not been reflected in the "payments due by period" section of the table.
(7)included in long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets at february 1, 2020, was a $22 million obligation for deferred compensation. as the specific payment dates for deferred compensation are unknown, the related balances have not been reflected in the "payments due by period" section of the table.
additionally, we had $1.25 billion in undrawn capacity on our credit facility at february 1, 2020. on march 19, 2020, we drew down the full amount of the facility to increase our cash position and maximize flexibility in light of the uncertainty surrounding the impact of covid-19. the proceeds and resulting liability from the facility will be included in cash and cash equivalents and short-term debt, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. we base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k. other than our adoption of asu 2016-02, leases, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and our adoption of asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we have not made any material changes to our accounting policies or methodologies during the past three fiscal years. we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. these estimates require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and generally incorporate significant uncertainty.
vendor allowances description we receive funds from our merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, primarily in the form of purchases-based or sales-based volumes and for product advertising and placement in our stores. we recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold. if the funds are not specifically related to purchase or sales volumes, the funds are recognized ratably over the performance period as the product promotion or placement is completed. funds that are determined to be a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendor's products are recorded as an offset to the related expense when incurred.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate due to the quantity and diverse nature of our vendor agreements, estimates are made to determine the amount of funding to be recognized in earnings or deferred as an offset to inventory. these estimates require a detailed analysis of complex factors, including (1) proper classification of the type of funding received; and (2) the methodology to estimate the portion of purchases-based funding that should be recognized in cost of sales, which considers factors such as inventory turn by product category and actual sell-through of inventory.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a 10% change in our vendor funding deferral at february 1, 2020, would have affected net earnings by approximately $32 million in fiscal 2020.
goodwill description goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. the impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. fair value reflects the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an arms-length transaction.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate determining fair value of a reporting unit is complex and typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows and other market information, such as trading multiples when applicable. cash flow analysis requires judgment regarding many factors, such as revenue growth rates, expenses and capital expenditures. market information requires judgmental selection of relevant market comparables. we have goodwill in two reporting units - best buy domestic and best buy health - with carrying values of $443 million and $541 million, respectively, as of february 1, 2020. there is greater uncertainty surrounding the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the best buy health reporting unit and therefore a greater degree of complexity and judgment involved in our impairment analysis. in particular, our analysis of the best buy health reporting unit fair value includes estimation of revenue growth rates, capital expenditure requirements and weighted-average cost of capital rates that incorporate significant judgment.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a 10% change in the fair value of the best buy health reporting unit at february 1, 2020, would not have a material effect on our net earnings.
inventory markdown description our merchandise inventories were $5.2 billion at february 1, 2020. we value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value through the establishment of inventory markdown adjustments. markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis. no adjustment is recorded for inventory that we are able to return to our vendors for full credit.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate markdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment about the expected recovery rates. the determination of the expected recovery rates includes the evaluation of historical recovery rates as well as factors such as product type and condition, forecasted consumer demand, product lifecycles, the promotional environment, vendor return rights and the expected sales channel of ultimate disposition. we also apply judgment in the assumptions about other components of net realizable value, such as vendor allowances and selling costs.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a 10% change in our markdown adjustment at february 1, 2020, would have affected net earnings by approximately $11 million in fiscal 2020.
tax contingencies description our income tax returns are periodically audited by u.s. federal, state and local and foreign tax authorities. tax authorities audit our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. at any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we may record a liability for such exposures. a number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. such assumptions can include complex and uncertain external factors, such as changes in tax law, interpretations of tax law and the timing of such changes, and uncertain internal factors such as taxable earnings by jurisdiction, the magnitude and timing of certain transactions and capital spending.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. a favorable tax settlement may reduce our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
service revenue description we sell customers support plans as part of a bundled service offer which may include items such as technical support, extended warranty, price discounts on future purchases, anti-virus software and one-time service repairs. we allocate the transaction price to all performance obligations identified in the contract based on their relative fair value. for technical support membership contracts, we typically recognize revenue over time on a usage basis, an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term. this method involves the use of expected usage patterns, derived from historic information.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate there is judgment in (1) determining the level at which we apply a portfolio approach to these contracts; (2) measuring the relative standalone selling price for performance obligations within these contracts to the extent that they are only bundled and sold to customers with other performance obligations, or alternatively, using a cost-plus margin approach; and (3) assessing the pattern of delivery across multiple portfolios of customers, including estimating current and future usage patterns. when insufficient history of usage is available, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a 10% change in the amount of services membership deferred revenue as of february 1, 2020, would have affected net earnings by approximately $12 million in fiscal 2020.

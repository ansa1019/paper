item 1a. risk factors our business and operations, and our industry in general, are subject to a variety of risks. the risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. if any of the following risks should occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely impacted. as a result, holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon.
volatile oil, gas and ngl prices significantly impact our business our financial condition, results of operations and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the general supply and demand for oil, gas and ngls, which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities. historically, market prices and our realized prices have been volatile. for example, over the last five years, nymex wti oil and nymex henry hub prices ranged from highs of over $75 per bbl and $4.80 per mmbtu, respectively, to lows of under $27 per bbl and $1.70 per mmbtu, respectively. such volatility is likely to continue in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to:
•   the domestic and worldwide supply of and demand for oil, gas and ngls;

•   volatility and trading patterns in the commodity-futures markets;

•   conservation and environmental protection efforts;

•   production levels of members of opec, russia, the u.s. or other producing countries;

•   geopolitical risks, including political and civil unrest in the middle east, africa and south america;

•   adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, public health crises and other catastrophic events, such as tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes and epidemics of infectious diseases;

•   regional pricing differentials, including in the delaware basin and other areas of our operations;

•   differing quality of production, including ngl content of gas produced;

•   the level of imports and exports of oil, gas and ngls and the level of global oil, gas and ngl inventories;

•   the price and availability of alternative energy sources;

•   technological advances affecting energy consumption and production, including with respect to electric vehicles;

•   stockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions;

•   the overall economic environment;

•   changes in trade relations and policies, including the imposition of tariffs by the u.s. or china; and

•   other governmental regulations and taxes.

estimates of oil, gas and ngl reserves are uncertain and may be subject to revision the process of estimating oil, gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir, particularly for new discoveries. because of the high degree of judgment involved, different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. in addition, the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors, including additional development and appraisal activity, the viability of production under varying economic conditions, including commodity price declines, and variations in production levels and associated costs. consequently, material revisions to existing reserves estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors. such revisions to proved reserves could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and the value of our properties, as well as the estimates of our future net revenue and profitability. our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves are included in "items 1 and 2. business and properties" of this report.
discoveries or acquisitions of reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production the production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted, while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. moreover, our current development activity is focused on unconventional oil and gas assets, which generally have significantly higher decline rates as compared to conventional assets. therefore, our estimated proved reserves and future oil, gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities, such as identifying additional producing zones in existing wells, utilizing secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or acquiring additional properties containing proved reserves. consequently, our future oil, gas and ngl production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves.
14
index to financial statements our operations are uncertain and involve substantial costs and risks our operating activities are subject to numerous costs and risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. drilling for oil, gas and ngls can be unprofitable, not only from dry holes, but from productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient revenue from production or high costs. substantial costs are required to locate, acquire and develop oil and gas properties, and we are often uncertain as to the amount and timing of those costs. our cost of drilling, completing, equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted. while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. in addition, our oil and gas properties can become damaged, our operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled and the costs of such operations may increase as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
•   unexpected drilling conditions, pressure conditions or irregularities in reservoir formations;

•   equipment failures or accidents;

•   fires, explosions, blowouts, cratering or loss of well control, as well as the mishandling or underground migration of fluids and chemicals;

•   adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes and extreme temperatures;

•   issues with title or in receiving governmental permits or approvals;

•   restricted takeaway capacity for our production, including due to inadequate midstream infrastructure or constrained downstream markets;

•   environmental hazards or liabilities;

•   restrictions in access to, or disposal of, water used or produced in drilling and completion operations; and

•   shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment.

the occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property, as well as significant liabilities. moreover, certain of these events could result in environmental pollution and impact to third parties, including persons living in proximity to our operations, our employees and employees of our contractors, leading to possible injuries, death or significant damage to property and natural resources. for example, we have from time to time experienced well-control events that have resulted in various remediation and clean-up costs and certain of the other impacts described above.
in addition, we rely on our employees, consultants and sub-contractors to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and standards. any violation of such laws or standards by these individuals, whether through negligence, harassment, discrimination or other misconduct, could result in significant liability for us and adversely affect our business. for example, negligent operations by employees could result in serious injury, death or property damage, and sexual harassment or racial and gender discrimination could result in legal claims and reputational harm.
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which can change and could adversely impact our business our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and other laws, rules and regulations, including with respect to environmental matters, worker health and safety, wildlife conservation, the gathering and transportation of oil, gas and ngls, conservation policies, reporting obligations, royalty payments, unclaimed property and the imposition of taxes. such regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling, completion and well operations and decommissioning obligations. if permits are not issued, or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling or completion activities, we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned. in addition, we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with applicable governmental laws, rules, regulations, permits or orders. for example, certain regulations require the plugging and abandonment of wells and removal of production facilities by current and former operators, including corporate successors of former operators.  these requirements may result in significant costs associated with the removal of tangible equipment and other restorative actions.
in addition, changes in public policy have affected, and in the future could further affect, our operations. regulatory and public policy developments could, among other things, restrict production levels, impose price controls, change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies. our operating and
15
index to financial statements other compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. in addition, changes in public policy may indirectly impact our operations by, among other things, increasing the cost of supplies and equipment and fostering general economic uncertainty. for example, changes in u.s. trade relations, particularly the imposition of tariffs by the u.s. and china, may increase the cost of materials we or our vendors use, thereby increasing our operating expense. although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations, such changes could significantly impact our profitability, financial condition and liquidity, particularly changes related to hydraulic fracturing, environmental matters more generally, seismic activity and income taxes, as discussed below.
hydraulic fracturing - in recent years, various federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process. for example, the epa has issued regulations under the federal clean air act establishing performance standards for oil and gas activities, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing, and it finalized in 2016 regulations that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. the epa also released a report in 2016 finding that certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing, such as water withdrawals and wastewater management practices, could result in impacts to water resources. the blm previously finalized regulations to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands but subsequently issued a repeal of those regulations in 2017. moreover, several states in which we operate have adopted, or stated intentions to adopt, laws or regulations that mandate further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, such as requiring disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, imposing more stringent permitting, disclosure and well-construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations and establishing standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing.  in addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular.
beyond these regulatory efforts, various policy makers, regulatory agencies and political candidates at the federal, state and local levels have proposed implementing even further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, including prohibiting the technology outright.  for example, certain candidates running to be elected president of the united states in 2020 have pledged to impose a ban on hydraulic fracturing.  it is possible that any such restrictions may particularly target industry activity on federal lands, which could adversely impact our operations in the delaware and powder river basins, as well as other areas where we operate under federal leases.  as of december 31, 2019, approximately 20% of our total leasehold resides on federal lands, and approximately 40% and 60% of our leasehold in the delaware and powder river basins, respectively, resides on federal lands.  although it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these or other proposals, any new restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs, delays or cessation in development or other restrictions on our operations.
environmental laws generally - in addition to regulatory efforts focused on hydraulic fracturing, we are subject to various other federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. these laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of remediating pollution that results from our operations. environmental laws may impose strict, joint and several liability, and failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal fines and penalties, as well as injunctions limiting operations in affected areas. any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements. any such changes could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.
seismic activity - earthquakes in northern and central oklahoma and elsewhere have prompted concerns about seismic activity and possible relationships with the oil and gas industry. legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address these concerns may result in additional levels of regulation or other requirements that could lead to operational delays, increase our operating and compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations. in addition, we are currently defending against certain third-party lawsuits and could be subject to additional claims, seeking alleged property damages or other remedies as a result of alleged induced seismic activity in our areas of operation.
changes to tax laws - we are subject to u.s. federal income tax as well as income or capital taxes in various state and foreign jurisdictions, and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of income taxes we must pay. in the jurisdictions in which we operate, income taxes are assessed on our earnings after consideration of all allowable deductions and credits. changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax, the types of costs that are considered allowable deductions or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings would all impact our income taxes and resulting operating cash flow.
16
index to financial statements concerns about climate change and related regulatory, social and market actions may adversely affect our business continuing and increasing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in legislative, regulatory and other initiatives, including international agreements, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane. policy makers at both the u.s. federal and state levels have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases. for example, both the epa and the blm have issued regulations for the control of methane emissions, which also include leak detection and repair requirements, for the oil and gas industry. following the change in presidential administrations, however, the agencies have attempted to revise or rescind their previously issued methane standards. litigation concerning these methane regulations and subsequent attempts to revise or rescind them is ongoing. nevertheless, several states where we operate, including wyoming and new mexico, have already imposed, or stated intentions to impose, laws or regulations designed to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas exploration and production activities. with respect to more comprehensive regulation, policy makers and political candidates have made, or expressed support for, a variety of proposals, such as the development of cap-and-trade or carbon tax programs, as well as the more sweeping "green new deal" resolutions introduced in congress in early 2019.  as generally proposed, a cap-and-trade program would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economy-wide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances, while a carbon tax could impose taxes based on emissions from our operations and downstream uses of our products.  the "green new deal" resolutions call for a 10-year national mobilization effort to, among other things, transition 100% of power demand in the u.s. to zero-emission sources and overhaul transportation systems in the u.s. to remove greenhouse gas emissions as much as is technologically feasible.
in addition to regulatory risk, other market and social initiatives resulting from the changing perception of climate change present risks for our business. for example, in an effort to promote a lower-carbon economy, there are various public and private initiatives subsidizing the development and adoption of alternative energy sources and technologies, including by mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies. these initiatives may reduce the competitiveness of carbon-based fuels, such as oil and gas. moreover, certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital have begun restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities due to their concern regarding climate change. such restrictions in capital could decrease the value of our business and make it more difficult to fund our operations. finally, governmental entities and other plaintiffs have brought, and may continue to bring, claims against us and other oil and gas companies for purported damages caused by the alleged effects of climate change. these and the other regulatory, social and market risks relating to climate change described above could result in unexpected costs, increase our operating expense and reduce the demand for our products, which in turn could lower the value of our reserves and have an adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity.
our hedging activities limit participation in commodity price increases and involve other risks we enter into financial derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil, gas and ngl price volatility. to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we will be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our hedging contracts. in addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the contract counterparties fail to perform under the contracts. moreover, as a result of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other legislation and regulation, hedging transactions and many of our contract counterparties have become subject to increased governmental oversight and regulations in recent years. although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these laws and the related rulemaking, some of which is ongoing, existing or future regulations may adversely affect the cost and availability of our hedging arrangements.
the credit risk of our counterparties could adversely affect us we enter into a variety of transactions that expose us to counterparty credit risk. for example, we have exposure to financial institutions and insurance companies through our hedging arrangements, our syndicated revolving credit facility and our insurance policies. disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise may impact these counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us.
in addition, we are exposed to the risk of financial loss from trade, joint interest billing and other receivables. we sell our oil, gas and ngls to a variety of purchasers, and, as an operator, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective share of costs. we also frequently look to buyers of oil and gas properties from us or our predecessors to perform certain obligations associated with the disposed assets, including the removal of production facilities and plugging and abandonment of wells. certain of these counterparties or their successors may experience insolvency, liquidity problems or other issues and may not be able to meet their obligations and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) owed to, and assumed from, us, particularly during a depressed or volatile commodity price environment. any such default may result in us being forced to cover the costs of those obligations and liabilities, which could adversely impact our financial results and condition.
17
index to financial statements our debt may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility, and any downgrade of our credit rating could adversely impact us as of december 31, 2019, we had total indebtedness of $4.3 billion. our indebtedness and other financial commitments have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to:
•   requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to debt service payments, thereby limiting our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;

•   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including low commodity price environments; and

•   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing due to higher costs and more restrictive covenants.

in addition, we receive credit ratings from rating agencies in the u.s. with respect to our debt. factors that may impact our credit ratings include, among others, debt levels, planned asset sales and purchases, liquidity, forecasted production growth and commodity prices. we are currently required to provide letters of credit or other assurances under certain of our contractual arrangements. any credit downgrades could adversely impact our ability to access financing and trade credit, require us to provide additional letters of credit or other assurances under contractual arrangements and increase our interest rate under any credit facility borrowing as well as the cost of any other future debt.
cyber attacks may adversely impact our operations our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies, and we anticipate expanding the use of technology in our operations, including through artificial intelligence, process automation and data analytics. concurrent with this growing dependence on technology is greater sensitivity to cyber attack related activities, which have frequently targeted our industry. cyber attackers often attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating sensitive information, intellectual property or financial assets, corrupting data or causing operational disruptions as well as to prevent users from accessing systems or information and demand payment in order to regain access. these attacks may be perpetrated by third parties or insiders. techniques used in these attacks often range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access. cyber attacks may also be performed in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as by causing denial-of-service attacks. in addition, our vendors, midstream providers and other business partners may separately suffer disruptions or breaches from cyber attacks, which, in turn, could adversely impact our operations and compromise our information. although we have not suffered material losses related to cyber attacks to date, if we were successfully attacked, we could incur substantial remediation and other costs or suffer other negative consequences, including litigation risks. moreover, as the sophistication of cyber attacks continues to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities.
we have limited control over properties operated by others certain of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. we have limited influence and control over the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, health and safety regulations or the amount and timing of required future capital expenditures. these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these properties could result in unexpected future costs and delays, curtailments or cancellations of operations or future development, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
18
index to financial statements midstream capacity constraints and interruptions impact commodity sales we rely on midstream facilities and systems owned and operated by others to process our gas production and to transport our oil, gas and ngl production to downstream markets. all or a portion of our production in one or more regions may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to losing access to plants, pipelines or gathering systems. such access could be lost due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, weather conditions and natural disasters, accidents, field labor issues or strikes. additionally, the midstream operators may be subject to constraints that limit their ability to construct, maintain or repair midstream facilities needed to process and transport our production. such interruptions or constraints could negatively impact our production and associated profitability.
insurance does not cover all risks as discussed above, our business is hazardous and is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration, development and production of oil, gas and ngls. to mitigate financial losses resulting from these operational hazards, we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance, as well as insurance coverage against certain losses resulting from physical damages, loss of well control, business interruption and pollution events that are considered sudden and accidental. we also maintain workers' compensation and employer's liability insurance. however, our insurance coverage does not provide 100% reimbursement of potential losses resulting from these operational hazards. additionally, we have limited or no insurance coverage for a variety of other risks, including pollution events that are considered gradual, war and political risks and fines or penalties assessed by governmental authorities. the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have an adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity.
competition for assets, materials, people and capital can be significant strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties. we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore, develop and operate properties. typically, during times of rising commodity prices, drilling and operating costs will also increase. during these periods, there is often a shortage of drilling rigs and other oilfield services, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans on a timely basis and within budget. competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and ngls. certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours and may have established superior strategic long-term positions and relationships, including with respect to midstream take-away capacity. as a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for assets or services and accessing capital and downstream markets. in addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production, such as changing worldwide price and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative energy sources and the application of government regulations.
our business could be adversely impacted by investors attempting to effect change stockholder activism has been increasing in our industry, and investors may from time to time attempt to effect changes to our business or governance, whether by stockholder proposals, public campaigns, proxy solicitations or otherwise. such actions could adversely impact our business by distracting our board of directors and employees from core business operations, requiring us to incur increased advisory fees and related costs, interfering with our ability to successfully execute on strategic transactions and plans and provoking perceived uncertainty about the future direction of our business. such perceived uncertainty may, in turn, make it more difficult to retain employees and could result in significant fluctuation in the market price of our common stock.
our acquisition and divestiture activities involve substantial risks our business depends, in part, on making acquisitions that complement or expand our current business and successfully integrating any acquired assets or businesses. if we are unable to make attractive acquisitions, our future growth could be limited. furthermore, even if we do make acquisitions, they may not result in an increase in our cash flow from operations or otherwise result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks, including, but not limited to:
•   mistaken estimates or assumptions about reserves, potential drilling locations, revenues and costs, including synergies and the overall costs of equity or debt;

•   difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired assets or business; and

19
index to financial statements
•   unknown and unforeseen liabilities or other issues related to any acquisition for which contractual protections prove inadequate, including environmental liabilities and title defects.

in addition, from time to time, we may sell or otherwise dispose of certain of our properties or businesses as a result of an evaluation of our asset portfolio and to help enhance our liquidity. these transactions also have inherent risks, including possible delays in closing, the risk of lower-than-expected sales proceeds for the disposed assets or business and potential post-closing claims for indemnification. moreover, volatility in commodity prices may result in fewer potential bidders, unsuccessful sales efforts and a higher risk that buyers may seek to terminate a transaction prior to closing.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis presents management's perspective of our business, financial condition and overall performance. this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance, current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
overview of 2019 results during 2019, we completed our transformation to a u.s. oil growth company with our exit from canada and pending sale of the barnett shale. these transactions accelerate efforts to focus exclusively on our resource-rich u.s. oil portfolio, which provides us with a strong foundation to grow returns, margin and profitability. by operating under a disciplined returns-driven strategy focused on delivering strong operational results, financial strength and value to our shareholders and continuing our commitment to environmental, social and governance excellence, we completed our transformation to "new devon" and made significant progress toward our cost reduction objectives as evidenced by these 2019 highlights:
•   closed on the sale of our canadian business for $2.6 billion ($3.4 billion canadian dollars) in june 2019.

•   announced the sale of our barnett shale assets for $770 million (expected closing in the second quarter of 2020).

•   completed workforce reduction and other cost reduction initiatives, reaching approximately $240 million of annualized g&amp;a savings.

•   improved capital efficiency by reducing capital expenditures approximately 10% and increasing oil production 21% compared to 2018.

•   retired $1.7 billion of senior notes, reducing annualized financing costs by $60 million.

•   repurchased $4.8 billion of our total $5.8 billion share repurchase authorizations, representing an outstanding share count reduction of nearly 30% since the program's inception.

•   increased our quarterly common stock dividend 12.5% to $0.09 per share beginning in the second quarter of 2019.

•   increased delaware basin and powder river basin production over 60% in 2019 compared to 2018.

•   reduced methane emissions by nearly 20% over the last three years and established a target to further reduce methane intensity rates by 2025.

•   exited 2019 with $1.8 billion of cash, inclusive of $380 million restricted for discontinued operations, $3.0 billion of available credit under our senior credit facility and have no debt maturities until 2025.

as presented in the graph at the left, our operating achievements are subject to the volatility of commodity prices. over the last four years, nymex wti oil and nymex henry hub prices ranged from average highs of $64.79 per bbl and $3.11 per mmbtu, respectively, to average lows of $43.36 per bbl and $2.46 per mmbtu, respectively.

24
index to financial statements trends of our annual earnings, operating cash flow, ebitdax and capital expenditures are shown below. the annual earnings chart presents amounts pertaining to both devon's continuing and discontinued operations. the annual cash flow chart presents amounts pertaining to devon's continuing operations. "core earnings" and "ebitdax" are financial measures not prepared in accordance with gaap. for a description of these measures, including reconciliations to the comparable gaap measures, see "non-gaap measures" in this item 7.
our net earnings in recent years have been significantly impacted by divestiture transactions and temporary, noncash adjustments to the value of our commodity hedges. net earnings in 2017 included a $0.1 billion gain on asset dispositions from continuing operations and a $0.2 billion hedge valuation gain, both net of taxes. net earnings in 2018 included a $2.2 billion gain on our enlink disposition, a $0.5 billion hedge valuation gain and a $0.2 billion gain on asset dispositions from continuing operations, all net of taxes. net earnings in 2019 included a $0.4 billion hedge valuation loss, $0.2 billion net gains and charges related to our canadian disposition and a $0.6 billion asset impairment related to our barnett shale disposition, all net of taxes. excluding these amounts, our core earnings have been more stable over recent years but continue to be heavily influenced by commodity prices.
like earnings, our operating cash flow is sensitive to volatile commodity prices. ebitdax, which excludes financial amounts related to discontinued operations, has been increasing over the past three years as a result of our new devon production growth and cost reductions. regardless of cash flow fluctuations, we remain focused on managing our capital investment to generate free cash flow. as operating cash flow has declined, we have adjusted our capital development plans accordingly.
25
index to financial statements business and industry outlook devon marked its 48th anniversary in the oil and gas business and its 31st year as a public company during 2019. as an established company with a strong leadership team, we have experience operating through periods of volatile commodity prices. with our focused strategy and portfolio of quality assets, we are committed to navigating the current environment while safeguarding our long-term financial strength.
market prices for crude oil and natural gas are inherently volatile. in 2019, wti oil prices averaged approximately $57.02/bbl versus $64.79/bbl in 2018. despite price support in the first half of 2019 driven by supply tightness and geopolitical tensions, 2019 wti oil prices overall were negatively impacted by trade concerns and economic slowdown fears, even with strong supply and demand fundamentals. looking ahead, crude oil has experienced near term downward pressure as a result of softer demand from the growing impact of the coronavirus related crisis. positive factors that could reduce these recent negative factors and create more demand for crude oil are the extension of opec cuts through 2020, as well as the international maritime organization 2020 regulations.
henry hub gas prices averaged approximately $2.63/mmbtu in 2019 versus $3.09/mmbtu in 2018. mt. belvieu blended index ngl prices averaged approximately $19.22/bbl in 2019 versus $28.31/bbl in 2018. natural gas and ngl prices faced strong headwinds in 2019 due to u.s. supply growth far outpacing demand for both commodities domestically and internationally. these factors continue to weigh on current natural gas and ngl prices.
as discussed in our critical accounting estimates, our stack assets are susceptible to a material asset impairment should prices decrease from current levels. while such an impairment would materially impact our reported net earnings, it would not impact our operating cash flow or our current near-term drilling plans.
to mitigate our exposure to commodity price volatility and ensure our financial strength, we continue to execute a disciplined, risk-management hedging program. our hedging program incorporates both systematic hedges added on a regular basis and discretionary hedges layered in on an opportunistic basis to take advantage of favorable market conditions. we are adding 2020 positions at desirable prices, and we currently have approximately 40% of our anticipated oil volumes and 25% of our anticipated gas volumes hedged. additionally, we are actively adding attractive hedges for 2021. further insulating our cash flow, we continue to examine and, when appropriate, execute attractive regional basis swap hedges in an effort to protect price realizations across our portfolio.
throughout 2019, our operational efficiencies continued to accelerate. our improved cost structure expanded margins, and we ended the year ahead of our multi-year cost savings initiative plan. as we carry our 2019 momentum into 2020, we will maintain our capital-efficiency focus and intensify our steadfast commitment to capital discipline. our returns-driven strategy will be underpinned by our continued efforts to improve our cost structure and grow higher-margin oil production. as such, our 2020 capital program has been optimized for strong returns, high single-digit oil growth, free cash flow and enhanced per-share cash flow growth.
to achieve our 2020 capital program objectives, our capital allocation priorities are four-fold: maintain base production, fund dividends, invest in high-return growth projects and return excess cash to shareholders. accordingly, over half of the 2020 spend will be focused in on our highest margin u.s. oil play, the delaware basin. as the most active program in devon's portfolio, capital activity in the delaware basin will be diversified across five core areas. also accretive to our 2020 returns-focused capital program is our 2020 rockies activity, where spend will be prioritized to our top-tier powder river basin development activity. in total, our 2020 operating plan is expected to deliver u.s. oil growth of approximately 7.5% to 9.0% on a retained asset basis.

we recognize fair value changes on our oil, gas and ngl derivative instruments in each reporting period. the changes in fair value resulted from new positions and settlements that occurred during each period, as well as the relationship between contract prices and the associated forward curves.
exploration expense decreased primarily due to recognizing $95 million in unproved impairments related to certain non-core acreage in the u.s during 2018 compared to $18 million in 2019.
asset impairments decreased due to recognizing $109 million of proved asset impairments and $47 million of non-oil and gas asset impairments during 2018 as discussed in note 5 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.

from 2017 to 2018, an increase in production volumes contributed to a $246 million increase in earnings. focused development activities in the delaware basin, stack and powder river basin drove production increases for new devon and were partially offset by decreased activity in the eagle ford and lower production volumes associated with our u.s. divested assets.

upstream revenues increased $918 million as a result of higher unhedged, realized prices for oil and ngls. the increase in oil sales primarily resulted from higher average wti crude index prices, which were 27% higher in 2018, resulting in an increase of approximately $600 million.
ngl sales increased $282 million as a result of 14% higher ngl prices at the mont belvieu, texas hub, as well as improved realizations in our ngl price. these increases were partially offset by unfavorable hedge cash settlements for our oil and ngl hedges.
in 2018, the presentation of certain processing arrangements changed from a net to a gross presentation. the change resulted in an increase to our upstream revenues and production expenses by approximately $191 million with no impact to net earnings.

2019 vs 2018
net earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax decreased $2.8 billion as we recognized a $2.6 billion ($2.2 billion after-tax) gain on the sale of our aggregate ownership interests in enlink and the general partner during 2018. net earnings from discontinued operations also decreased due to a $748 million asset impairment to our barnett shale assets in the fourth quarter of 2019.
2018 vs 2017
net earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax increased $1.5 billion as we recognized a $2.6 billion ($2.2 billion after-tax) gain on the sale of our aggregate ownership interests in enlink and the general partner during 2018. the gain was partially offset by a decrease in upstream revenues, which was primarily driven by widening differentials for bitumen sales in canada to the wti index during the fourth quarter of 2018. market forces widened canadian heavy oil differentials beyond historical norms and negatively impacted the price we realized on our canadian production. we had basis swaps for approximately half of our fourth quarter production to mitigate the effect of the lower market price. to further mitigate the effects of the lower price, we reduced our jackfish production in november 2018 which impacted our fourth quarter production by approximately 8 mbbls/d. for discussion on discontinued operations, see note 18 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.

operating cash flow - continuing operations net cash provided by operating activities continued to be a significant source of capital and liquidity in 2019. our operating cash flow increased $460 million, or 29%, to $2.0 billion year over year. in 2019, our operating cash flow nearly funded the entirety of our capital expenditures program and dividends, allowing us to use available cash balances and net divestiture proceeds to fund other capital uses.
our operating cash flow increased $340 million, or 27%, from 2017 to 2018. our operating cash flow funded approximately 70% of our capital expenditures program and dividends in 2018 and 2017, respectively. as a result, we utilized available cash balances and divestiture proceeds to supplement our operating cash flows.
divestitures of property and investments - continuing operations during 2019, 2018 and 2017, as part of our announced divestiture programs, we sold non-core u.s. upstream assets for $390 million, $500 million and $425 million, respectively. for further discussion, see note 2 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.

index to financial statements capital expenditures consist primarily of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations and other corporate activities. the vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition, drilling and development of oil and gas properties. our capital program is designed to operate within or near operating cash flow and may fluctuate with changes to commodity prices and other factors impacting cash flow. this is evidenced by our operating cash flow fully funding capital expenditures in 2019 and funding approximately 75% and 77% of capital expenditures in 2018 and 2017, respectively. our capital expenditures are lower in 2019 primarily due to our decreased spending in the stack, partially offset by increased capital investment in higher margin assets in the delaware and powder river basins.
debt activity, net during 2019, our debt decreased $162 million due to the repayment of our 6.30% senior notes at maturity.
during 2018, our debt decreased $922 million due to completed tender offers of certain long-term debt as well as the maturity of certain senior notes. in conjunction with the tender offers, we recognized a $312 million loss on the early retirement of debt, including $304 million of cash retirement costs and fees. for additional information, see note 13 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
repurchases of common stock and shareholder distributions we repurchased 68.6 million shares of common stock for $1.8 billion in 2019 and 78.1 million shares of common stock for $3.0 billion in 2018 under a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors. for additional information, see note 17 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" in this report.
devon paid common stock dividends of $140 million, $149 million and $127 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. during the second quarter of 2018, we increased our quarterly dividend 33% from $0.06 to $0.08 per share as part of our focus on returning cash to shareholders. in february 2019, we further increased our quarterly dividend 12.5% to $0.09 per share, beginning in the second quarter of 2019. for additional information, see note 17 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
contributions from noncontrolling interests during 2019, we received approximately $116 million in cash contributions from our partner in cdm.

discontinued operations operating cash flow in 2019 decreased $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion from 2018 and 2017, respectively, as a result of the divestitures referenced above. additionally, operating cash flow was negatively affected in the first quarter of 2019 primarily due to realization impacts associated with the widening canadian differentials in the fourth quarter of 2018. foreign currency denominated intercompany loan activity resulted in a realized loss of $32 million and $241 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, as a result of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar in relation to the canadian dollar. foreign currency denominated intercompany loan activity resulted in a realized gain of $9 million in 2017, as a result of the weakening of the u.s. dollar in relation to the canadian dollar. there was an offset in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash line in the above table, resulting in no impact to the net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.
on june 27, 2019, devon completed the sale of substantially all its oil and gas assets and operations in canada for proceeds of $2.6 billion. in the second and fourth quarter of 2018, devon completed the sale of a portion of its barnett shale assets, located primarily in johnson and wise counties, texas for approximately $500 million in combined proceeds. on july 18, 2018, devon completed the sale of its aggregate ownership interests in enlink and the general partner for $3.125 billion. during 2017, enlink divested its ownership interest in howard energy partners for approximately $190 million.
cash flows from financing activities includes the $1.5 billion of senior notes retired prior to maturity in july 2019 and common and preferred units enlink issued and sold during 2017 generating net proceeds of $501 million. distributions to noncontrolling interests in the table above exclude the distributions enlink and the general partner paid to devon, which have been eliminated in consolidation. distributions enlink and the general partner paid to devon were $134 million and $265 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively.
liquidity the business of exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas is capital intensive. because oil, natural gas and ngl reserves are a depleting resource, we, like all upstream operators, must continually make capital investments to grow and even sustain production. generally, our capital investments are focused on drilling and completing new wells and maintaining production
36
index to financial statements from existing wells. at opportunistic times, we also acquire operations and properties from other operators or land owners to enhance our existing portfolio of assets.
historically, our primary sources of capital funding and liquidity have been our operating cash flow, cash on hand and asset divestiture proceeds. additionally, we maintain a commercial paper program, supported by our revolving line of credit, which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances. if needed, we can also issue debt and equity securities, including through transactions under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec. we estimate the combination of our sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund our planned capital requirements as discussed in this section.
operating cash flow key inputs into determining our planned capital investment is the amount of cash we hold and operating cash flow we expect to generate over the next one to three or more years. at the end of 2019, we held approximately $1.8 billion of cash, inclusive of $380 million of cash restricted for discontinued operations. our operating cash flow forecasts are sensitive to many variables and include a measure of uncertainty as these variables differ from our expectations.
commodity prices - the most uncertain and volatile variables for our operating cash flow are the prices of the oil, gas and ngls we produce and sell. prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products. these factors, which are difficult to predict, create volatility in prices and are beyond our control.
to mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices, we utilize various derivative financial instruments to protect a portion of our production against downside price risk. we hedge our production in a manner that systematically places hedges for several quarters in advance, allowing us to maintain a disciplined risk management program as it relates to commodity price volatility. we supplement the systematic hedging program with discretionary hedges that take advantage of favorable market conditions. the key terms to our oil, gas and ngl derivative financial instruments as of december 31, 2019 are presented in note 3 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
further, when considering the current commodity price environment and our current hedge position, we expect to achieve our capital investment priorities. should wti drop closer to $45/bbl for an extended period, we would shift our focus to preserving our financial strength and operational continuity. however, as wti/bbl rises above $50, our free cash flow will accelerate, providing additional capital allocation opportunities.
operating expenses - commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses. significant commodity price decreases can lead to a decrease in drilling and development activities. as a result, the demand and cost for people, services, equipment and materials may also decrease, causing a positive impact on our cash flow as the prices paid for services and equipment decline. however, the inverse is also generally true during periods of rising commodity prices.
in 2019, we aggressively optimized our cost structure in conjunction with our canadian and barnett shale asset divestitures, as we focus on our remaining four u.s. oil plays, align our workforce with the retained business and reduce outstanding debt. these optimizations include cost reductions and efficiencies related to our capital programs, g&a, financing costs and production expenses.
credit losses - our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways. this includes the credit risk related to customers who purchase our oil, gas and ngl production, the collection of receivables from our joint interest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate and counterparties to our derivative financial contracts. we utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers, partners and counterparties. such mechanisms include, under certain conditions, requiring letters of credit, prepayments or collateral postings.

index to financial statements divestitures of property and equipment in december 2019, we announced the sale of our barnett shale assets for approximately $770 million. we expect this transaction to close in the second quarter of 2020.
credit availability we have $3.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility at december 31, 2019. on december 13, 2019, we entered into an amendment and extension agreement to, among other things, (i) effect the extension of the maturity date of the senior credit facility from october 5, 2023 to october 5, 2024 with respect to the consenting lenders and (ii) modify the maximum number of maturity extension requests during the term of the senior credit facility from two to three. as a result of this amendment, the senior credit facility matures on october 5, 2024, with the option to extend the maturity date by two additional one-year periods subject to lender consent. subsequent to october 5, 2023, the borrowing capacity decreases to $2.8 billion. the senior credit facility supports our $3.0 billion of short-term credit under our commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2019, there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program. see note 13 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report for further discussion.
the senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant. this covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization, as defined in the credit agreement, of no more than 65%. as of december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with this covenant with a 19.1% debt-to-capitalization ratio.
our access to funds from the senior credit facility is not restricted under any "material adverse effect" clauses. it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses. these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower's financial condition, operations, properties or business considered as a whole, the borrower's ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement. while our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect, the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect.
as market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions, liquidity position and other factors, we may from time to time seek to repurchase or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt or equity securities in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. any such cash repurchases by us may be funded by cash on hand or incurring new debt. the amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. furthermore, any such repurchases or exchanges may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of such indebtedness, which would impact the trading liquidity of such indebtedness.
debt ratings we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the u.s. in determining our debt ratings, the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including, but not limited to, commodity pricing levels, our liquidity, asset quality, reserve mix, debt levels, cost structure, planned asset sales and production growth opportunities. our credit rating from standard and poor's financial services is bbb- with a stable outlook. our credit rating from fitch is bbb with a stable outlook. our credit rating from moody's investor service is ba1 with a positive outlook. any rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under certain contractual arrangements.
there are no "rating triggers" in any of our contractual debt obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level. however, a downgrade could adversely impact our interest rate on any credit facility borrowings and the ability to economically access debt markets in the future.
share repurchase program in december 2019, our board of directors approved a $1.0 billion share repurchase program that expires on december 31, 2020. this repurchase program was approved in conjunction with the announced divestiture of devon's assets in the barnett shale. under this new program, $800 million of the $1.0 billion authorization is conditioned upon the closing of the pending barnett shale divestiture.

index to financial statements capital expenditures our 2020 exploration and development budget is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion to $1.85 billion.
in december 2019, we announced a partnership under which we will monetize half our working interest across 133 undrilled locations in the stack for an approximate $100 million drilling carry spread over the next four years. drilling operations under this agreement are expected to commence in mid-2020.

index to financial statements critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual amounts could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. we consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.
oil and gas assets accounting, classification, reserves & valuation successful efforts method of accounting and classification we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities which requires management's assessment of the proper designation of wells and associated costs as developmental or exploratory. this classification assessment is dependent on the determination and existence of proved reserves, which is a critical estimate discussed in the section below. the classification of developmental and exploratory costs has a direct impact on the amount of costs we initially recognize as exploration expense or capitalize, then subject to dd&a calculations and impairment assessments and valuations.
once a well is drilled, the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time and requires both judgment and application of industry experience. development wells are always capitalized. costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found. at the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs to determine whether the costs should continue to remain capitalized or shall be expensed. when making this determination, management considers current activities, near-term plans for additional exploratory or appraisal drilling and the likelihood of reaching a development program. if management determines future development activities and the determination of proved reserves are unlikely to occur, the associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings. otherwise, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized. at december 31, 2019, all suspended well costs have been suspended for less than one year.
similar to the evaluation of suspended exploratory well costs, costs for undeveloped leasehold, for which reserves have not been proven, must also be evaluated for continued capitalization or impairment. at the end of each quarter, management assesses undeveloped leasehold costs for impairment by considering future drilling plans, drilling activity results, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects. at december 31, 2019, devon had approximately $250 million of undeveloped leasehold. of the remaining undeveloped leasehold costs at december 31, 2019, approximately $6 million is scheduled to expire in 2020. the leasehold expiring in 2020 relates to areas in which devon is actively drilling. if our drilling is not successful, this leasehold could become partially or entirely impaired.
reserves our estimates of proved and proved developed reserves are a major component of dd&a calculations. additionally, our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments. estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data, projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures. the process of estimating oil, gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations, particularly for new discoveries. different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data. our engineers prepare our reserve estimates. we then subject certain of our reserve estimates to audits performed by a third-party petroleum consulting firm. in 2019, 85% of our reserves were subjected to such audits.
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves, when revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information. in the past five years, annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates, which have been both increases and decreases in individual years, have averaged less than 5% of the previous year's estimate. however, there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future. the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.

index to financial statements valuation of long-lived assets long-lived assets used in operations, including proved and unproved oil and gas properties, are depreciated and assessed for impairment annually or whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group. for dd&a calculations and impairment assessments, management groups individual assets based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level ("common operating field") for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. the determination of common operating fields is largely based on geological structural features or stratigraphic condition, which requires judgment. management also considers the nature of production, common infrastructure, common sales points, common processing plants, common regulation and management oversight to make common operating field determinations. these determinations impact the amount of dd&a recognized each period and could impact the determination and measurement of a potential asset impairment.
management evaluates assets for impairment through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. if, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital investment plans, considering all available information at the date of review. the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews include future production volumes associated with proved producing and risk-adjusted proved undeveloped, probable and possible reserves. besides the estimates of reserves and future production volumes, future commodity prices are the largest driver in the variability of undiscounted pre-tax cash flows. for our impairment determinations, we utilize the forward strip prices for the first five years and apply internally generated price forecasts for subsequent years. we estimate and escalate or de-escalate future capital and operating costs by using a method that correlates cost movements to price movements similar to recent history. changes to any of these assumptions could result in lower undiscounted pre-tax cash flows and impact both the recognition and timing of impairments. should management materially reduce planned capital investment and commodity prices remain depressed, recognition of material asset impairments could become more likely for certain of our assets.
as commodity prices decreased throughout 2019 and at year-end approximated the prices devon used to determine and compute material asset impairments in 2019, management conducted a robust review of its assets for impairment as of december 31, 2019. based on our recent impairment evaluations, our stack asset's sum of undiscounted pre-tax cash flows exceeds the carrying value by less than 10%. this cushion has narrowed significantly since the end of 2018 due primarily to approximately 30% and 5% declines in forward ngl and natural gas pricing, respectively, and negative non-price reserve revisions of approximately 40 mmboe as discussed in note 21 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report. as of december 31, 2019, the difference between the stack's undiscounted pre-tax cash flows, which is used to determine whether an impairment exists, and the discounted pre-tax cash flows, which is used to measure an impairment, is approximately $2.0 billion. therefore, if commodity prices deteriorate or we materially reduce future development plans, causing the capitalized costs to exceed the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows, our stack asset would be subject to a material impairment of capitalized costs.
income taxes the amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal, state, provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions. we recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period and the applicable statutory tax rates. we routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, estimate and establish accruals for such amounts. we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses and other tax carryforwards. we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. within continuing operations, devon maintains only a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax assets, including certain tax credits and state net operating losses. devon also has recorded a valuation allowance in discontinued operations against certain canadian deferred tax assets.
the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management. these assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change. material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits, changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters.

index to financial statements non-gaap measures core earnings we make reference to "core earnings (loss) attributable to devon" and "core earnings (loss) per share attributable to devon" in "overview of 2019 results" in this item 7 that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap. these non-gaap measures are not alternatives to gaap measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported under gaap. core earnings (loss) attributable to devon, as well as the per share amount, represent net earnings excluding certain noncash and other items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our financial results. for more information on the results of discontinued operations for our barnett shale assets, canadian operations and for enlink and the general partner, see note 18 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" in this report. our non-gaap measures are typically used as a quarterly performance measure. amounts excluded for 2019 relate to asset dispositions, the gain on the sale of canadian operations, noncash asset impairments (including noncash barnett shale and unproved asset impairments), deferred tax asset valuation allowance, costs associated with early retirement of debt, fair value changes in derivative financial instruments and foreign currency, restructuring and transaction costs associated with the workforce reductions in 2019 and restructuring and transaction costs associated with the divestment of our canadian operations in 2019.
amounts excluded for 2018 relate to asset dispositions, the gain on the sale of devon's aggregate ownership interests in enlink and the general partner, noncash asset impairments (including noncash unproved asset impairments), deferred tax asset valuation allowance, costs associated with early retirement of debt, fair value changes in derivative financial instruments and foreign currency, restructuring and transaction costs associated with the workforce reductions in 2018.
amounts excluded for 2017 relate to asset dispositions, noncash asset impairments (including noncash unproved asset impairments), u.s. tax reform changes, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes, legal entity restructuring and costs associated with early retirement of debt.
we believe these non-gaap measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates published by securities analysts. we also believe these non-gaap measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our peers.
below are reconciliations of our core earnings and earnings per share to their comparable gaap measures.

index to financial statements ebitdax and field-level cash margin to assess the performance of our assets, we use ebitdax and field-level cash margin. we compute ebitdax as net earnings from continuing operations before income tax expense; financing costs, net; exploration expenses; dd&a; asset impairments; asset disposition gains and losses; non-cash share-based compensation; non-cash valuation changes for derivatives and financial instruments; restructuring and transaction costs; accretion on discounted liabilities; and other items not related to our normal operations. field-level cash margin is computed as oil, gas and ngl revenues less production expenses. production expenses consist of lease operating, gathering, processing and transportation expenses, as well as production and property taxes.
we exclude financing costs from ebitdax to assess our operating results without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. exploration expenses and asset disposition gains and losses are excluded from ebitdax because they generally are not indicators of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. dd&a and impairments are excluded from ebitdax because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. we exclude share-based compensation, valuation changes, restructuring and transaction costs, accretion on discounted liabilities and other items from ebitdax because they are not considered a measure of asset operating performance.
we believe ebitdax and field-level cash margin provide information useful in assessing our operating and financial performance across periods. ebitdax and field-level cash margin as defined by devon may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net earnings from continuing operations.
below are reconciliations of net earnings to ebitdax and a further reconciliation to field-level cash margin.

a reduction in demand may adversely affect our business.
our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in drug r&d expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as by academic institutions, government laboratories or private foundations. similarly, economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries also affect their r&d budgets and, consequentially, our business as well.
our clients include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on molecules in the non-clinical phases of r&d (and in particular discovery and safety assessment) and to outsource the products and services we provide. furthermore, our clients (particularly larger biopharmaceutical companies) continue to search for ways to maximize the return on their investments with a focus on lowering r&d costs per drug candidate. fluctuations in the expenditure amounts in each phase of the r&d budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. r&d budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, spending priorities (including available resources of our biotechnology clients, particularly those that are cash-negative, who may be highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment), general economic conditions, institutional budgetary policies and the impact of government regulations, including potential drug pricing legislation. available funding for biotechnology clients in particular may be affected by the capital markets, investment objectives of venture capital investors and priorities of biopharmaceutical industry sponsors.
for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing r&d budgets at our clients, please see the sections entitled "our strategy" and "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
further, our research products operations are structured to produce particular blood products based on customers' existing demand, and perceived potential changes in demand, for these products. sudden or unexpected changes in demand for these products could have an adverse impact on our profitability. increasing demand could harm relationships with customers if we are unable to alter production capacity, or purchase products from other suppliers, to fill orders adequately. this could result in a decrease in overall revenue and profits. decreases in demand may require us to make sizable investments to restructure operations away from declining products to the production of new products. lack of access to sufficient capital, or lack of adequate time to properly respond to such a change in demand, could result in declining revenue and profits, as customers transfer to other suppliers.
a reduction or delay in government funding of r&d may adversely affect our business.
a portion of revenue, predominantly in our rms segment, is derived from clients at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the u.s. national institutes of health (nih) and similar domestic and international agencies, which can be difficult to forecast. we also sell directly to the nih and these other agencies. government funding of r&d is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. our revenue may be adversely affected if our clients delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals, included reduced allocations to government agencies that fund r&d activities. government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund r&d activities, or nih funding may not be directed towards projects and studies that require the use of our products and services, both of which could adversely affect our business and our financial results.
several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply, which if interrupted could adversely affect our business.
we depend on a limited international source of supply for certain products, such as large research models. disruptions to their continued supply may arise from health problems (including as a result of the spread of diseases, such as coronavirus), export or import laws/restrictions or embargoes, tariffs, international trade regulations, foreign government or economic instability, severe weather conditions, increased competition among suppliers for models, disruptions to the air travel system, activist campaigns, commercial disputes, supplier insolvency or other ordinary course or unanticipated events. any disruption of supply could materially harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms. while we continue to take steps to find alternative supply channels and lock in supply with preferred sources through multi-year and/or minimum commitment contracts, such mitigating efforts may not prove successful at ensuring a steady and timely supply or may require us to pay significantly higher prices for such products
16
during periods of global shortage or restrictions on the transportation of products. in addition, limited global supply or regional restrictions on transportation for certain products may require us to source products from non-preferred vendors.
further, our research products business depends on the availability of appropriate donors.  if the level of donor participation declines, we may not be able to reduce costs sufficiently to maintain profitability of the research products business. for example, regulations intended to reduce the risk of introducing infectious diseases in the blood supply (including coronavirus) could also result in a decreased pool of potential donors. due to any pandemic, epidemic or outbreak in one or more regions in which our research products business operates, the portion of the public that typically donates may be unable, or unwilling to donate, thereby significantly reducing the availability of research products upon which we rely. in addition, even if suspected diseases prove to be no more virulent than other more common disease, the heightened fear among the public resulting from widespread media coverage may result in a dramatic decline in donations.
we have in the past experienced and in the future could experience an unauthorized access into our information systems.
we operate large and complex information systems that contain significant amounts of client data. as a routine element of our business, we collect, analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the non-clinical studies we conduct for our clients. unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such information systems to steal data or disrupt the systems. while we have taken measures to protect them from intrusion, in march 2019, we detected evidence that an unauthorized third party, who we believe was well resourced and highly sophisticated, accessed certain of our information systems and copied data. we worked with a leading cyber security firm to assist in our investigation and coordinated with law enforcement authorities. our investigation indicated that the affected information included client information.
in december 2019, we disclosed that we had completed our remediation of the incident identified in march of 2019. while we have implemented additional security safeguards, including:
•   remediation of the march 2019 incident;
•   cooperation with u.s. federal authorities' investigation into the incident and established an ongoing relationship to better understand the ever-changing nature of cybersecurity related threats;
•   additional visibility into our network and environment;
•   additional monitoring of our environment;
•   active threat hunting in our environment;
•   a reduction of our footprint of externally facing technology;
•   enhanced protection for externally facing web applications;
•   the addition of multi-factor authentication to ingress points;
•   the addition of denial of service attack protection; and
•   increased network segmentation, such efforts may not be successful, in which case we could suffer significant harm.
our contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from the studies we conduct. in the event the confidentiality of such information is compromised, whether by unauthorized access or other breaches, we could be exposed to significant harm, including termination of customer contracts, damage to our customer relationships, damage to our reputation and potential legal claims from customers, employees and other parties. in addition, we may face investigations by government regulators and agencies as a result of a breach.
further, we are required to comply with the data privacy and security laws in many jurisdictions. for example, we are required to comply with the european union (eu) general data protection regulation (gdpr), which became effective on may 25, 2018 and imposes heightened obligations and enhanced penalties for noncompliance (including up to four percent (4%) of global revenue). the cost of compliance, and the potential for fines and penalties for non-compliance, with gdpr may have a significant adverse effect on our business and operations. also, the california legislature passed the california consumer privacy act (ccpa), which became effective january 1, 2020. the ccpa creates new transparency requirements and grants california residents several new rights with regard their personal information. failure to comply with the ccpa may result in, among other things, significant civil penalties and injunctive relief, or potential statutory or actual damages. we have made changes to, and investments in, our business practices and will continue to monitor developments and make appropriate
17
changes to help attain compliance with these evolving and complex regulations. additionally, while collecting research products from donors, we may collect, use, disclose, maintain and transmit patient information in ways that will be subject to many of the numerous state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, storage, transmission or confidentiality of patient-identifiable health information.
contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory, harm our reputation for contaminant-free production, result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs.
our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain infectious agents, such as certain viruses and bacteria, because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health. the presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminant-free research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses, including gems, harm our reputation for contaminant-free production and result in decreased sales. there also exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our client's facilities, with similar impact to them for which we could be liable for damages. in some cases, we may produce or import animals carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in humans; and in the case of such a contamination or undiagnosed infection, there could be a possible risk of human exposure and infection and liability for damages to infected persons.
we are also subject to similar contamination risks with respect to our large research models. while some of these models are owned by us and maintained at our facilities, others are reserved for us and maintained at sites operated by the original provider. accordingly, risk of contamination may be outside of our control, and we depend on the practices and protocols of third parties to ensure a contamination-free environment. a contamination may require extended cdc quarantine with subsequent reduced sales as a result of lost client orders, as well as the potential for complete inventory loss and disinfection of the affected quarantine rooms. furthermore, while we often negotiate for contractual risk indemnification, the third party may refuse to fulfill its indemnification obligation or may be unable to as a result of insolvency or other impediments.
contaminations are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results. if they occur, contaminations typically require cleaning up, renovating, disinfecting, retesting and restarting production or services. such clean-ups result in inventory loss, clean-up and start-up costs, and reduced sales as a result of lost client orders and potentially credits for prior shipments. in addition to microbiological contaminations, the potential for genetic mix-ups or mis-matings also exists and may require us to restart the applicable colonies, and would likely result in inventory loss, additional start-up costs and possibly reduced sales. contaminations also expose us to risks that clients will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements.
further, many of our operations are comprised of complex mechanical systems that are subject to periodic failure, including aging fatigue. such failures are unpredictable, and while we have made significant capital expenditures designed to create redundancy within these mechanical systems, strengthen our biosecurity, improve our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations, and replace impaired systems and equipment in advance of such events, failures and/or contaminations may still occur.
any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results, and compliance with new regulations and guidance may result in additional costs.
any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission on behalf of our clients to regulatory authorities. this could harm our reputation, our prospects for future work and our operating results. for example, the issuance of a notice of objectionable observations or a warning letter from the fda based on a finding of a material violation affecting data integrity by us for glp or cgmp requirements that are not addressed to the regulatory monitoring authorities' satisfaction could materially and adversely affect us. if our operations are found to violate any applicable law or other governmental regulations, we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines. any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management's attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation.
in recent years fda has issued guidance that now requires submissions to be presented in a format that conforms with the fda's send (standardization for exchange of nonclinical data) standards that apply to our clients' nda and ind submissions and require us to provide electronic data in specific formats that will allow for more efficient, higher quality regulatory reviews. accordingly, our clients expect us to timely deliver their nonclinical data compliant with send. notwithstanding, some of these standards require additional operating and capital expenses that will impact not only us and our industry competitors, but clients in the biomedical research community. non-compliance with any of these expectations
18
could lead to official action by a government authority, damage to our reputation and a potential loss of business.
in addition, regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of laboratory animals for research purposes continue to evolve. similarly, guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community on both a national and international basis including transportation, mandated contingency planning, euthanasia guidance, import and export requirements of biological materials, health monitoring requirements and the use of disinfectants.
our research products business is subject to extensive and complex regulation by federal, state and local governments in the u.s. and in the other countries in which it operates. this business requires us to obtain many licenses, permits, authorizations, approvals, certificates and other types of governmental permissions and to comply with various regulations in every jurisdiction in which we operate. federal, state and local regulations change often, and new regulations are frequently adopted. changes in the regulations could require us to change the way in which we operate our business and the cost of compliance with new or changed regulations could be significant.
our donor collection centers are registered with the fda and the fda periodically conducts inspections of those facilities and operations. at the conclusion of each inspection, the fda provides us with a list of observations of regulatory issues discovered during the inspection that could result in additional regulatory action. failure to comply with the regulations of the fda could result in sanctions and/or remedies and have a material adverse effect on us.
the outsourcing trend in non-clinical (discovery and safety assessment) stages of drug discovery and development may decrease, which could impair our growth.
over the past decade, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have generally increased their outsourcing of non-clinical research support activities, such as discovery and safety assessment. while many industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue to increase for the next several years (although with different growth rates for different phases of drug discovery and development), decreases in such outsourcing may result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of any one or more of our service lines and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently influenced outsourcing demand from our clients, please see the section entitled "our strategy" included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries, including potential healthcare reform, could decrease the need for the services we provide.
governmental agencies throughout the world strictly regulate the drug development process. our business involves helping our customers navigate these regulatory processes. accordingly, many regulations, and often new regulations, are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries. however, some changes in regulations, such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of streamlined or expedited drug approval procedures, or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive, could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services.
although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable national, regional and local laws, as well as other accepted guidance used by oversight bodies (including the usda, the standards set by the international air transport association, the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora, u.s. fish and wildlife service, the centers for disease control, the department of transportation, the department of state, the office of laboratory animal welfare of nih, the drug enforcement agency, as well as numerous other oversight agencies in the jurisdictions in which we operate), failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions. in addition, if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety assessment procedures that utilize laboratory animals (as has been advocated by certain groups), certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected.
in march 2010, the u.s. congress enacted healthcare reform legislation, the patient protection and affordable care act (aca), which includes provisions impacting drug manufacturers, such as (1) the expansion of access to health insurance coverage, (2) the expansion of the medicaid program, (3) the enactment of an industry fee on pharmaceutical companies and (4) the imposition of an excise tax on the sale of medical devices. in addition, the tax cuts and jobs act, enacted in 2017, repeals the aca's individual health insurance mandate, which is considered a key component of the aca. since the aca and its implementation continue to face challenges in congress and federal courts, and from certain state governments, opposition advocacy groups and some small business organizations, the ultimate effects of this legislation are unclear on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future.
19
implementation of healthcare reform legislation may have certain benefits, but also may contain costs that could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs. this could adversely affect r&d expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the u.s. and abroad. in addition, new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability, increase our costs or limit our service offerings. furthermore, if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products, our clients may spend less or reduce their growth in spending on r&d.
while it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur, changes at the local, state or federal level, or in laws and regulations in effect in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or have business relationships, may significantly impact our domestic and foreign businesses and/or those of our clients. furthermore, modifications to international trade policy, public company reporting requirements, environmental regulation and antitrust enforcement may have a materially adverse impact on us, our suppliers or our clients.
we bear financial risk for contracts that may be terminated or reduced in scope, underpriced, subject to cost overruns or delayed.
many of our agreements, including those which underlie our strategic relationships with some of our more significant clients, provide for termination or reduction in scope with little or no notice. in addition, we sell our products and services to our competitors, and similarly they sell products and services to us. for instance, we have historically entered into, and currently are party to, contracts with certain of our competitors to distribute specialty research models in locations where our competitors may not have distribution capabilities.
our counterparties (including our clients who are competitors) may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including:
•   the products being tested fail to satisfy safety requirements;
•   unexpected or undesired study results;
•   production problems resulting in shortages of the drug being tested;
•   a client's decision to forego or terminate a particular study;
•   our competitors' establishment of alternative distribution channels;
•   dissatisfaction with our performance under the agreement;
•   the loss of funding for the particular research study; or
•   general convenience/counterparty preference.
if a counterparty terminates a contract with us, we are typically entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and, in some cases, termination fees. cancellation of a large contract or proximate delay, cancellation or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business and, therefore, may adversely affect our operating results.
furthermore, many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or fee-for-service with a cap basis and, accordingly, we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates. such underpricing or significant cost overruns could have an adverse effect on the our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire, or in managing our current and future divestitures, our business may be adversely impacted.
during the last two decades, we have steadily expanded our business through numerous acquisitions, including our recent acquisitions of citoxlab and hemacare. we plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies and form strategic alliances. however, businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable. we risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners, but not completing transactions.
acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include:
•   difficulties in achieving business and financial success;
20
•   difficulties and expenses incurred in assimilating and integrating operations, services, products, technologies or pre-existing relationships with our clients, distributors and suppliers;
•   challenges with developing and operating new businesses, including those that are materially different from our existing businesses and that may require the development or acquisition of new internal capabilities and expertise;
•   potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies that are not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller or the insurance we acquire in connection with the transaction;
•   loss of key employees;
•   the presence or absence of adequate internal controls and/or significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies;
•   diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;
•   a more expansive regulatory environment;
•   acquisitions could be dilutive to earnings, or in the event of acquisitions made through the issuance of our common stock to the shareholders of the acquired company, dilutive to the percentage of ownership of our existing shareholders;
•   differences in foreign business practices, customs and importation regulations, language and other cultural barriers in connection with the acquisition of foreign companies;
•   new technologies and products may be developed that cause businesses or assets we acquire to become less valuable; and
•   disagreements or disputes with prior owners of an acquired business, technology, service or product that may result in litigation expenses and diversion of our management's attention.
if an acquired business, technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations, our results of operations may be adversely affected.
some of the same risks exist when we decide to sell a business, site or product line. in addition, divestitures could involve additional risks, including the following:
•   difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel;
•   diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; and
•   the need to agree to retain or assume certain current or future liabilities in order to complete the divestiture.
we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of our businesses (including specific product lines and service offerings) to determine whether any divestitures are appropriate. any divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets and which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms, and in a timely manner. we may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business, site or product line or service offering and, as a result, we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the divestiture.
impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may adversely impact future results of operations.
we have intangible assets, including goodwill, on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses. the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates. these estimates are based on, among other factors, projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses and discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets. disruptions in global financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could, among other things, impact the discount rate. other assumptions used in the valuations and actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows, which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such assets.
21
if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated, overall macroeconomic or industry conditions deteriorate and/or our market capitalization declines, this could impact the assumptions used in establishing the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets. to the extent goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, their carrying value will be written down to their implied fair values and a charge will be made to our income from continuing operations. such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results. as of december 28, 2019, the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles on our consolidated balance sheet was $2.2 billion.
our business is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other risks relating to operating internationally.
a significant part of our revenue is derived from operations outside the u.s. we expect that international revenue will continue to account for a significant percentage of our total revenue for the foreseeable future.
changes in foreign currency exchange rates, could materially adversely impact our results. foreign currencies we receive for sales and in which we record expenses outside the u.s. could be subject to unfavorable exchange rates with the u.s. dollar, resulting in a reduction in the amount of revenue and cash flow (and an increase in the amount of expenses) that we recognize and causing fluctuations in reported financial results. we also carry foreign currency exposure associated with differences between where we conduct business. for example, certain contracts are frequently denominated in currencies other than the currency in which we incur expenses related to those contracts. where expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which contracts are priced, fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results from the currency translation exposure associated with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, as well as from the exposure associated with transactions of our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency other than the respective subsidiary's functional currency. while our financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, the financial statements of many of our subsidiaries outside the u.s. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency. during consolidation, these results are translated into u.s. dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. as a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar relative to the local currencies in which our foreign subsidiaries report could cause significant fluctuations in our reported results. moreover, as exchange rates vary, revenue and other operating results may differ materially from our expectations. adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
other risks associated with our international business include:
•   potentially negative consequences from changes in u.s. and/or foreign tax laws, or interpretations thereof, notably tax regulations issued and to-be-issued with respect to u.s. tax reform and the eu anti-tax avoidance directives i and ii;
•   general economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate, including possible implications of brexit;
•   potential international conflicts, including terrorist acts;
•   exchange controls, adverse tax consequences and legal restrictions on the repatriation of funds into the u.s.;
•   difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations, including risks of work stoppages and/or strikes, as well as violations of local laws or anti-bribery laws such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa), the u.k. bribery act and the oecd convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions;
•   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;
•   the difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations;
•   unfavorable labor regulations in foreign jurisdictions;
•   longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries; and
•   compliance with export controls, import requirements and other trade regulations, including those relating to certain products of which there is limited supply.
these risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. for example, as mentioned above, we are subject to compliance with the fcpa and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their third-party intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the
22
purpose of obtaining or retaining business. while our employees, distributors and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition and results of operations.
our operations might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event.
we depend on our customers and facilities for the continued operation of our business. while we maintain disaster recovery plans, they might not adequately protect us. despite any precautions we take for natural disasters or other catastrophic events, these events, including terrorist attack, a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a disease (including coronavirus), hurricanes, fire, floods and ice and snow storms, could result in damage to and closure of our or our customers' facilities or the infrastructure on which such facilities rely. such disruptions could significant delays in the shipments of our products, reduce our capacity to provide services, eradicate unique manufacturing capabilities, result in our customers' inability to pay for our products or services and, ultimately, result in the loss of revenue and clients. although we carry business interruption insurance policies and typically have provisions in our contracts that protect us in certain events, our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur. any natural disaster or catastrophic event affecting us or our customers could have a significant negative impact on our operations and financial performance.
failure to comply with u.s., state, local or international environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including regulations issued by the occupational safety and health administration, environmental protection agency, nuclear regulatory agency and department of transportation, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business.
we are subject to licensing and regulation under laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us that may be costly.
new technologies may be developed, validated and increasingly used in biomedical research, which could reduce demand for some of our products and services.
the scientific and research communities continue to explore methods to develop improved cellular and animal model systems that would increase the translation to human studies and vice-versa and possibly replace or supplement the use of traditional living animals as test platforms in biomedical research. some companies have developed techniques in these areas that may have scientific merit to improve translation between species. in addition, technological improvements to existing or new processes, such as imaging and other translational biomarker technologies, could result in the refinement and utility for the number of animal research models necessary to improve the translation from non-clinical to clinical studies. there is an increasing push to focus on in vitro technologies such that employ human biospecimens, stem cell technologies and genome editing.
it is our strategy to explore these in vitro technologies to refine and potentially reduce the utilization of animal models as these new methods become validated. for example, our discovery and safety assessment businesses have programs to evaluate the utility of induced pluripotent stems cells, advanced in vitro models, artificial intelligence and machine learning in discovery and preclinical development. successful commercialization of alternatives to traditional research models may not be sufficient to fully offset reduced sales or profits from research models. in addition, alternative research methods could decrease the need for future research models, and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales. lastly, other companies or entities may develop research models with characteristics different than the ones that we produce, and which may be viewed as more desirable by some of our clients.
negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business.
the products and services that we provide our clients are essential to the drug discovery, development and manufacturing processes, and a significant amount are mandated by law. notwithstanding, certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes. historically, our core research model activities with rats, mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention. however, research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention, including shareholder proposals and attempts to disrupt air carriers from transporting research models, impacting the industry. this has included periodic demonstrations near facilities operated by us and at our
23
annual meetings, as well as shareholder proposals we received for some of our past annual meetings of shareholders. any negative attention, threats or acts of vandalism directed against either our animal research activities or our third-party service providers, such as our airline carriers, in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently.
our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects.
as of december 28, 2019, we had $1.9 billion of debt. our debt could have significant adverse effects on our business, including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms; requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt; limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities; and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates. for additional information regarding our debt, please see note 9, "long-term debt and finance lease obligations", included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
the interest rate on our $2.3 billion credit facility (credit facility), which matures in fiscal year 2023, is linked to libor. as of december 28, 2019, amounts outstanding on our credit facility were $193.8 million on our term loan and $676.1 million on our revolving credit facility, for which there is an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $2.05 billion. in 2017, the financial conduct authority (fca) in the u.k. announced that it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021. it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop. if libor ceases to exist, the method and rate used to calculate our interest rates and/or payments on our debt in the future may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, or that do not otherwise correlate over time with, the interest rates and/or payments that would have been applicable to our obligations if libor was available in its current form, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. while we continue to take steps to mitigate the impact of the phase-out or replacement of libor, such efforts may not prove successful. in addition, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of libor. disruption in the financial market could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
costs increasing more rapidly than market prices could reduce profitability.
the cost of collecting, processing and testing blood products has risen significantly in recent years and will likely continue to increase. these cost increases are related to new and improved testing procedures, increased regulatory requirements related to blood safety, and higher staff and supply costs related to collecting and processing blood products. competition and fixed price contracts may limit our ability to maintain existing operating margins. some competitors have greater resources than us to sustain periods of marginally profitable or unprofitable sales. costs increasing more rapidly than market prices may reduce profitability and may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive.
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. we compete for business with other cros and blood product and therapeutic services companies, as well as internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients, who may have greater resources than ours. we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for outsourced services. we compete on a variety of factors, including:
•   reputation for on-time quality performance;
•   reputation for regulatory compliance;
•   expertise and experience in multiple specialized areas;
•   scope and breadth of service and product offerings across the drug discovery and development spectrum;
•   scope and breadth of service and product offerings across the manufacturing support spectrum;
•   ability to provide flexible and customized solutions to support our clients' drug discovery, non-clinical development, and manufacturing support needs;
•   broad geographic availability (with consistent quality);
•   price/value, spend and flexibility;
•   technological and scientific expertise and efficient drug development processes;
•   quality of facilities;
24
•   financial stability;
•   size;
•   ability to acquire, process, analyze and report data in an accurate manner; and
•   accessibility of client data through secure portals.
if we do not compete successfully, our business will suffer. increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that could adversely affect our operating results. the drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation, particularly among the biotechnology companies, which are targets for each other and for large pharmaceutical companies. if this trend continues, it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and cros generally, with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates. in addition, small, specialized entities considering entering the cro industries will continue to find lower barriers to entry, and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities to acquire and consolidate these companies, thus further increasing possible competition. more generally, our competitors or others might develop technologies, services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies, services or products, or that render our technologies, services or products less competitive or obsolete. if competitors introduce superior technologies, services or products and we cannot make enhancements to ours to remain competitive, our competitive position, and in turn our business, revenue and financial condition, would be materially and adversely affected. in the aggregate, these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our technologies, services or products and could adversely affect our financial results.
changes in u.s. and international tax law.
in 2017, significant u.s. tax law changes from the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (u.s. tax reform) went into effect and reduced the u.s. federal statutory tax rate, broadened the corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions, exclusions and credits, limited the ability of u.s. corporations to deduct interest expense and allowed for the repatriation of foreign earnings to the u.s. with a 100% federal dividends received deduction prospectively. in addition, u.s. tax reform required a one-time transitional tax on foreign cash equivalents and previously unremitted earnings. several of the new provisions enacted as part of u.s. tax reform still require clarification and guidance from the internal revenue service (irs) and treasury department. these or other changes in u.s. tax laws could impact our profits, effective tax rate and cash flows.
additionally, the oecd, the european commission (ec) and individual taxing jurisdictions have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. the oecd released its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of rules to address concerns regarding base erosion and profit shifting (beps). this initiative resulted in proposed and enacted changes to tax laws in various countries including france, germany, luxembourg, netherlands and the u.k. in addition, the oecd and ec and individual countries are examining how taxing rights should be allocated among countries considering the digital economy. future changes to tax laws or interpretation of tax laws resulting from enacted laws could increase our effective tax rate, which would affect our profitability.
we receive substantial tax credits in canada, from both the canadian federal and quebec governments, france and the u.k. any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits or increase to tax rates due to tax law changes or outcomes of tax controversies could have a material adverse effect on our profits, cash flows and effective tax rate.
contract research services create a risk of liability.
as a cro, we face a range of potential liabilities, which may include:
•   risks associated with errors or omissions in reporting of study detail in non-clinical studies that may lead to inaccurate reports, which may undermine the usefulness of a study or data from the study, or which may potentially advance studies absent the necessary support or inhibit studies from proceeding to the next level of testing;
•   risks associated with our possible failure to properly care for our clients' property, such as research models and samples, study compounds, records, work in progress, other archived materials or goods and materials in transit, while in our possession;
•   risks that models in our breeding facilities or in facilities that we manage may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to them or humans, despite preventive measures for the quarantine and handling of imported animals;
•   risks that we may have errors and omissions and/or product liabilities related to our products designed to conduct
25
lot release testing of medical devices, injectable drugs, food, beverages and home and beauty products (primarily through our microbial solutions business), or in the testing of biologics and other services performed by our biologics business, which could result in us or our clients failing to identify unsafe or contaminated materials; and
•   risk of transmitting dangerous infectious diseases, as a result of the failure of our screening and testing processes, or new pathogens that may be undetected by such processes.
while we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods, it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks. in our rms business, we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing, quarantine procedures and veterinary staff vigilance, through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections. in our dsa and manufacturing businesses, we attempt to reduce these risks by contractual risk transfer provisions entitling us to be indemnified by our clients and subject to a limitation of liability, by insurance maintained by our clients and/or by us and by various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business.
contractual risk transfer indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions, such as negligence or misconduct. we could be materially and adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is outside any contractual indemnification provision, or if a party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or the damage is beyond the scope or level of insurance coverage. we also often contractually indemnify our clients (subject to a limitation of liability), similar to the way they indemnify us, and we may be materially adversely affected if we have to fulfill our indemnity obligations. furthermore, either we or a party required to indemnify us may not be able to maintain such insurance coverage (either at all or on terms acceptable to us).
upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions.
in recent years, we have been updating and consolidating systems and automating processes in many parts of our business with a variety of systems, including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses. the expansion and ongoing implementation of the systems may occur at a future date based on value to the business. in general, the process of planning and preparing for these types of integrated, wide-scale implementations is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges, including information security assessment and remediation, data conversion, network and system cutover and user training. problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments, missed sales, billing errors and accounting errors.
the failure to successfully obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights and defend against challenges to our intellectual property rights could adversely affect us.
many of our services, products and processes rely on intellectual property. in some cases, that intellectual property is owned by another party and licensed to us, sometimes exclusively. to protect our intellectual property rights, we primarily rely upon trade secret law, confidentiality agreements and policies, invention assignments and other contractual arrangements, along with patent, copyright and trademark laws. existing laws of certain countries outside of the united states in which we operate offer only limited protection, and these are subject to change at any time. in addition, the agreements upon which we rely to protect our intellectual property might be breached, or might not be fully enforceable. our intellectual property rights might not prevent our competitors from independently developing intellectual property that is similar to or duplicative of ours. also, enforcing our intellectual property rights might also require substantial time, money and oversight, and we might not be successful in enforcing our rights. if we are unable to obtain or maintain the proprietary rights to our intellectual property, if we are unable to prevent attempted infringement against our intellectual property, or if we are unable to defend against claims that we are infringing on another party's intellectual property, we could be adversely affected. these adverse effects could include us having to abandon, alter or delay the deployment of products, services or processes that rely on such intellectual property; having to procure and pay for licenses from the holders of intellectual property rights that we seek to use; and having to pay damages, fines, court costs and attorney's fees in connection with intellectual property litigation.
further, the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue. legal proceedings relating to intellectual property are expensive, take significant time, and divert management's attention from other business concerns, whether we win or lose. if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages, and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms.
we may not be able to successfully develop and market new services and products.
we may seek to develop and market new services and products that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings. we believe our ability to in-license new technologies from third parties will be critical to our ability to offer new
26
products and services to our clients. our ability to gain access to technologies that we need for new products and services depends, in part, on our ability to convince inventors and their agents or assignees that we can successfully commercialize their inventions. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify new technologies of interest to our clients. even if we are able to identify new technologies of interest, we may not be able to negotiate license agreements on acceptable terms, or at all. if we are unable to develop new services and products and/or create demand for those newly developed services and products, our future business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
the decision by british voters to exit the european union may adversely affect our business.
the first stage of the u.k.'s withdrawal from the european union ("brexit") took place on january 31, 2020, when the u.k. left the european union and entered a transition phase. during the transition phase, the u.k. needs to negotiate the terms of its future trading and other relationships with the european union. the scope and timing of these negotiations have created significant uncertainty and continue to do so. the u.k. prime minister has said that a trade agreement needs to be reached by december 31, 2020. there is currently no mechanism to automatically extend the transition period, but there is a possibility that the transition period may be extended by agreement between the u.k. and the european union.
given the continuing uncertainty concerning the terms of the u.k.'s future relationship with the european union, including the possibility that there may still be no negotiated agreement despite the results of the december 2019 general election, we have formed a committee (comprised of senior managers across our business functions) to address key risks among four main themes: (1) trade and customs, (2) employees and immigration, (3) strategy and business planning and (4) legislative changes. that committee will continue until the situation is clarified.
in the absence of a trade deal in the short to medium term, the u.k.'s trade with the european union and the rest of the world would be subject to tariffs and duties set by the world trade organization. additionally, the movement of goods between the u.k. and the remaining member states of the european union will be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure. these changes to the trading relationship between the u.k and european union would likely result in increased cost of goods imported into and exported from the u.k. and may decrease the profitability of our u.k. and other operations. additional currency volatility could drive a weaker british pound, which increases the cost of goods imported into our u.k. operations and may decrease the profitability of our u.k. operations. a weaker british pound versus the u.s. dollar also causes local currency results of our u.k. operations to be translated into fewer u.s. dollars during a reporting period. although we are undertaking efforts to mitigate those risks within our control, a failure to adequately mitigate such risks or other factors outside our control could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel, which would harm our business.
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management. james c. foster, our chief executive officer and president since 1992 and chairman since 2000, has held various positions with us for four decades. while we entered into an employment agreement with mr. foster in 2018, most members of our senior management do not have employment agreements. if mr. foster or other members of senior management do not continue in their present positions, our business may be adversely impacted.
because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. while we have a strong record of employee retention, and we strive to reduce the impact of the potential loss of existing employees by having an established organizational talent review process that identifies successors and potential talent needs, there is still significant competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary, pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields. therefore, we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business. the loss of the services of existing personnel, as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner, could harm our business.
our quarterly operating results may vary, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.
our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by the risks discussed above, as well as:
•   changes in the general global economy;
•   changes in the mix of our products and services;
•   cyclical buying patterns of our clients;
27
•   the financial performance of our venture capital investments; and
•   the occasional extra week ("53rd week") that we recognize in a fiscal year (and fourth fiscal quarter thereof) due to our fiscal year ending on the last saturday in december.
we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results. nonetheless, fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.
since we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future, our shareholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.
we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future. any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, capital requirements, legal requirements, earnings and other factors. consequently, our shareholders should not rely on dividends to receive a return on their investment.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements. actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in item 1a, "risk factors" and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. certain percentage changes may not recalculate due to rounding.
overview we are a full service, early-stage contract research organization (cro). for over 70 years, we have been in the business of providing the research models required in research and development of new drugs, devices, and therapies. over this time, we have built upon our original core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science (research model technologies) to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services, both good laboratory practice (glp) and non-glp, that enable us to support our clients from target identification through non-clinical development. we also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients' manufacturing activities. utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more flexible drug development model, which reduces their costs, enhances their productivity and effectiveness, and increases speed to market.
our client base includes all major global biopharmaceutical companies, many biotechnology companies, cros, agricultural and industrial chemical companies, life science companies, veterinary medicine companies, contract manufacturing companies, medical device companies, and diagnostic and other commercial entities, as well as leading hospitals, academic institutions, and government agencies around the world. we currently operate in over 90 facilities and over 20 countries worldwide, which numbers exclude our insourcing solutions (is) sites.
segment reporting our three reportable segments are research models and services (rms), discovery and safety assessment (dsa), and manufacturing support (manufacturing). our rms reportable segment includes the research models and research model services businesses. research models includes the commercial production and sale of small research models, as well as the supply of large research models. research model services includes: genetically engineered models and services (gems), which performs contract breeding and other services associated with genetically engineered research models; research animal diagnostic services (rads), which provides health monitoring and diagnostics services related to research models; and insourcing solutions (is), which provides colony management of our clients' research operations (including recruitment, training, staffing, and management services). our dsa reportable segment includes services required to take a drug through the early development process including discovery services, which are non-regulated services to assist clients with the identification, screening, and selection of a lead compound for drug development, and regulated and non-regulated (glp and non-glp) safety assessment services. our manufacturing reportable segment includes microbial solutions, which provides in vitro (non-animal) lot-release testing products, microbial detection products, and species identification services; biologics testing services (biologics), which performs specialized testing of biologics; avian vaccine services (avian), which supplies specific-pathogen-free chicken eggs and chickens; and contract development and manufacturing (cdmo) services, which, until we divested this business on february 10, 2017, allowed us to provide formulation design and development, manufacturing, and analytical and stability testing for small molecules.
recent acquisitions and divestiture our strategy is to augment internal growth of existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. we continued to make strategic acquisitions designed to expand our portfolio of services to support the drug discovery and development continuum and position us as a market leader in the outsourced discovery services market. our recent acquisitions and divestiture are described below.
on january 3, 2020, we acquired hemacare corporation (hemacare), a business specializing in the production of human-derived cellular products for the cell therapy market. the acquisition of hemacare will expand our comprehensive portfolio of early-stage research and manufacturing support solutions to encompass the production and customization of high-quality, human derived cellular products to better support clients' cell therapy programs. the preliminary purchase price of hemacare was approximately $380 million in cash. the acquisition was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from our credit facility under the multi-currency revolving facility. this business will be reported as part of our rms reportable segment.
32
on august 28, 2019, we acquired an 80% ownership interest in a supplier that supports our dsa reportable segment. the remaining 20% interest is a redeemable non-controlling interest. the preliminary purchase price was $23.4 million, net of a $4.0 million pre-existing relationship for a supply agreement settled upon acquisition, and subject to certain post-closing adjustments that may change the purchase price. the acquisition was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from our credit facility under the multi-currency revolving facility. the business is reported as part of our dsa reportable segment.
on april 29, 2019, we acquired citoxlab, a non-clinical cro, specializing in regulated safety assessment services, non-regulated discovery services, and medical device testing. with operations in europe and north america, the acquisition of citoxlab further strengthens our position as a leading, global, early-stage cro by expanding our scientific portfolio and geographic footprint, which enhances our ability to partner with clients across the drug discovery and development continuum. the preliminary purchase price for citoxlab was $527.7 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments that may change the purchase price. the acquisition was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from our credit facility under the multi-currency revolving facility. citoxlab is reported as part of our dsa reportable segment.
on april 3, 2018, we acquired mpi research, a non-clinical cro providing comprehensive testing services to biopharmaceutical and medical device companies worldwide. the acquisition enhances our position as a leading global early-stage cro by strengthening our ability to partner with clients across the drug discovery and development continuum. the purchase price for mpi research was $829.7 million in cash. the acquisition was funded by borrowings on our credit facility as well as the issuance of $500.0 million of 5.5% senior notes due 2026 (2026 senior notes) in an unregistered offering. mpi research is reported as part of our dsa reportable segment.
on january 11, 2018, we acquired kws biotest limited (kws biotest), a cro specializing in in vitro and in vivo discovery testing services for immuno-oncology, inflammatory and infectious diseases. the acquisition enhances our discovery expertise, with complementary offerings that provide our customers with additional tools in the active therapeutic research areas of oncology and immunology. the purchase price for kws biotest was $20.3 million in cash. in addition to the initial purchase price, the transaction included aggregate, undiscounted contingent payments of up to £3.0 million based on future performance. during the three months ended september 29, 2018, the terms of these contingent payments were amended, resulting in a fixed payment of £2.0 million, or $2.6 million, which was paid during the three months ended march 30, 2019. the kws biotest business is reported as part of our dsa reportable segment.
on august 4, 2017, we acquired brains on-line, a cro providing critical data that advances novel therapeutics for the treatment of central nervous system (cns) diseases. brains on-line strategically expands our existing cns capabilities and establishes us as a single-source provider for a broad portfolio of discovery cns services. the purchase price for brains on-line was $21.3 million in cash. in addition to the initial purchase price, the transaction included aggregate, undiscounted contingent payments of up to €6.7 million based on future performance. during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, the terms of these contingent payments were amended, resulting in a fixed payment of $2.6 million, which was paid during the three months ended june 29, 2019. the brains on-line business is reported as part of our dsa reportable segment.
on february 10, 2017, we completed the divestiture of our cdmo business to quotient clinical ltd., based in london, england for $75.0 million in proceeds, net of cash, cash equivalents, and working capital adjustments. the cdmo business was acquired in april 2016 as part of the acquisition of wil research and was reported in our manufacturing reportable segment.
fiscal quarters our fiscal year is typically based on 52-weeks, with each quarter composed of 13 weeks ending on the last saturday on, or closest to, march 31, june 30, september 30, and december 31. a 53rd week was included in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, which is occasionally necessary to align with a december 31 calendar year-end.
business trends the demand for our products and services continued to increase meaningfully in fiscal year 2019. our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients continued to intensify their use of strategic outsourcing to improve their operating efficiency and to access capabilities that they do not maintain internally. small and mid-size biotechnology clients continued to be the primary driver of revenue growth as these clients benefited from the continued strength in the biotechnology funding environment in fiscal year 2019, from capital markets, partnering with large biopharmaceutical companies, and investment by venture capital. many of our large biopharmaceutical clients have continued to increase investments in their drug discovery and early-stage development efforts and have strengthened their relationships with both cros, like charles river, and biotechnology
33
companies to assist them in bringing new drugs to market. our full service, early-stage portfolio continued to lead to additional client discussions and new business opportunities in fiscal year 2019, as clients seek to outsource larger portions of their early-stage drug research programs to us.
the primary result of these trends was robust revenue growth within our dsa reportable segment in fiscal year 2019, particularly from biotechnology clients. in addition to the acquisition of citoxlab in april 2019, increased demand and pricing contributed to robust safety assessment revenue growth in fiscal year 2019. our safety assessment facilities remained well utilized in fiscal year 2019. recent acquisitions (most notably citoxlab and mpi) added modest amounts of available capacity to accommodate increasing client demand. we believe the breadth and depth of our scientific expertise, quality, and responsiveness remain key criteria when our clients make the decision to outsource to us. as biotechnology funding remains robust and our clients continue to pursue their goal of more efficient and effective drug research to bring innovative new therapies to market, they are evaluating outsourcing more of their research programs, such as discovery services. we have enhanced our discovery services capabilities to provide clients with a comprehensive portfolio that enables them to start working with us at the earliest stages of the discovery process. we have accomplished this through acquisitions, including citoxlab's discovery services, kws biotest in january 2018 and brains on-line in august 2017, and through adding cutting-edge capabilities to our discovery toolkit through partnerships, such as distributed bio, bitbio, and fios genomics. in fiscal year 2019, demand in our discovery services business also increased meaningfully, driven by biotechnology clients as many of these clients either initiated or continued to work with us on integrated programs and other projects. our efforts to enhance our sales strategies, provide clients with flexible partnering models, and become a trusted scientific partner for our clients' early-stage programs have been successful, and enabled us to attract new clients. demand from large biopharmaceutical companies also increased. these clients continue to have significant internal discovery capabilities, on which they can choose to rely. in order for large biopharmaceutical clients to increasingly outsource more work to us, we must continue to demonstrate that our services can augment and accelerate our clients' drug discovery processes.
demand for our products and services that support our clients' manufacturing activities was also robust in fiscal year 2019. demand for our microbial solutions business remained strong as manufacturers continued to increase their use of our rapid microbial testing solutions. our biologics business continued to benefit from increased demand for services associated with the growing proportion of biologic drugs in the pipeline and on the market. to support this increased demand, we continued to expand the capacity of our biologics business.
demand for our research models and services increased in fiscal year 2019, driven by strong demand for research models in china, higher revenue for research model services, and improved pricing. demand for research models in china continued to be robust in fiscal year 2019, as clients in this growing market continue to value our high-quality research models. demand for research models services also improved in fiscal year 2019, particularly for our is and gems businesses. the is business further benefited from a five-year, $95.7 million contract from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, or niaid, that commenced in september 2018. the continued effect of the consolidation of internal infrastructure within our large biopharmaceutical clients and a longer-term trend towards more efficient use of research models has led to reduced demand for research models outside of china. we are confident that research models and services will remain essential tools for our clients' drug discovery and early-stage development efforts, and the rms business will continue to be an important source of cash flow generation for us. in addition, in january 2020, we enhanced the rms business' growth profile and portfolio of critical research tools that we are able to supply through the acquisition of hemacare, a premier provider of human-derived cellular products used in cell therapies.
overview of results of operations and liquidity revenue for fiscal year 2019 was $2.6 billion compared to $2.3 billion in fiscal year 2018. the 2019 increase as compared to the corresponding period in 2018 was $355.1 million, or 15.7%, and was primarily due to both growth in our dsa and manufacturing segments, as discussed in the above "business trends" section, as well as the recent acquisitions of citoxlab and mpi research; partially offset by the negative effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which decreased revenue by $36.1 million, or 1.5%, when compared to the corresponding period in 2018.
in fiscal year 2019, our operating income and operating income margin were $351.2 million and 13.4%, respectively, compared with $331.4 million and 14.6%, respectively, in fiscal year 2018. the increase in operating income was primarily due to increased revenues discussed above and contributions from our recent acquisitions of citoxlab and mpi research; partially offset by the following, which decreased the operating income margin: increased amortization expense and costs related to our recent acquisition activity; increased costs incurred in connection with certain global restructuring initiatives, continued investments to support future growth of the businesses, which includes increased investments in personnel (staffing levels and hourly wage increases) and facility expansions (primarily in the rms and biologics businesses), and company-wide it and
34
infrastructure projects. offsetting the decreases in operating income margin were the realization of improved volume, mix, and pricing across our products and services portfolio as well as the impact of recent productivity initiatives across all businesses.
net income attributable to common shareholders increased to $252.0 million in fiscal year 2019, from $226.4 million in the corresponding period of 2018. the increase in net income attributable to common shareholders of $25.6 million was primarily due to the increase in operating income described above, as well as a lower income tax rate due to recognizing a $20.6 million deferred tax asset in fiscal year 2019 for net operating losses expected to be utilized in the future due to changes in the company's international financing structure.
during fiscal year 2019, our cash flows from operations was $480.9 million compared with $441.1 million for fiscal year 2018. the increase was primarily driven by the increase to net income and the favorable timing of vendor and supplier payments compared to the same period in 2018, partially offset by unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities, specifically related to the timing of net contract balances from contracts with customers (collectively trade receivables, net; deferred revenue; and customer contract deposits), increases in inventory levels in response to customer demand, and higher compensation payments compared to the prior year period.
on october 23, 2019, we issued $500.0 million of 4.25% senior notes due in 2028 (2028 senior notes) in an unregistered offering. interest on the 2028 senior notes is payable semi-annually on may 1 and november 1, beginning on may 1, 2020. net proceeds from the 2028 senior notes of approximately $494 million, along with available cash, was used to prepay $500.0 million of our term loan under our credit facility. additionally, on november 4, 2019, we amended and restated our credit facility by increasing the amount of our multi-currency revolving facility by $500.0 million, from $1.55 billion to $2.05 billion. under specified circumstances, we have the ability to increase the term loan and/or revolving facility by up to $1.0 billion in the aggregate.
in march 2019, we detected unauthorized access into portions of our information systems and commenced an investigation into the incident, coordinated with u.s. federal law enforcement and leading cyber security experts, and promptly implemented a comprehensive containment and remediation plan. in december 2019, we completed our remediation of this incident. the financial impact of the march 2019 event is not material. refer to part i, item 1a. risk factors in this annual report on form 10-k for further details on the results of the remediation efforts.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states (u.s.). the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods and related disclosures. these estimates and assumptions are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. we base our estimates on our historical experience, trends in the industry, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe that the application of our accounting policies, each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1, "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies", to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:
revenue recognition accounting standard codification topic 606, "revenue from contracts with customers" (asc 606) became effective for us on december 31, 2017 and was adopted using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. for contracts that were modified before the effective date, we reflected the aggregate effect of all modifications when identifying performance obligations and allocating transaction price in accordance with the practical expedient, which did not have a material effect on the cumulative impact of adopting asc 606. the reported results for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 reflect the application of asc 606 guidance while the historical results for fiscal year 2017 was prepared under the guidance of asc 605, "revenue recognition" (asc 605). there is no material difference in the reporting of revenue during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 in accordance with asc 606 when compared to fiscal year 2017 in accordance with asc 605.

revenue is recognized when, or as, obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, which occurs when control of the promised products or services is transferred to customers. revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products or services to a customer ("transaction price").
to the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing the amount to which we expect to be entitled. variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available. sales, value add, and other taxes collected on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue.
when determining the transaction price of a contract, an adjustment is made if payment from a customer occurs either significantly before or significantly after performance, resulting in a significant financing component. generally, we do not extend payment terms beyond one year. applying the practical expedient, we do not assess whether a significant financing component exists if the period between when we perform our obligations under the contract and when the customer pays is one year or less. our contracts do not generally contain significant financing components.
contracts with customers may contain multiple performance obligations. for such arrangements, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised products or services underlying each performance obligation. we determine standalone selling prices based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. if the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.
contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements. contract modifications exist when the modification either creates new, or changes existing, enforceable rights and obligations. generally, when contract modifications create new performance obligations, the modification is considered to be a separate contract and revenue is recognized prospectively. when contract modifications change existing performance obligations, the existing transaction price and measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates is generally recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis.
product revenue is generally recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, and may be upon shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual shipping terms of a contract. service revenue is generally recognized over time as the services are delivered to the customer based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. depending on which better depicts the transfer of value to the customer, we generally measure our progress using either cost-to-cost (input method) or right-to-invoice (output method). we use the cost-to-cost measure of progress when it best depicts the transfer of value to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contract, generally related to fixed fee service contracts. under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. the costs calculation includes variables such as labor hours, allocation of overhead costs, research model costs, and subcontractor costs. revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. the right-to-invoice measure of progress is generally related to rate per unit contracts, as the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on discrete service or time-based increments, such as samples tested or labor hours incurred. revenue is recorded in the amount invoiced since that amount corresponds directly to the value of our performance to date. during fiscal year 2019, $1.6 billion, or approximately 60%, of our total revenue recognized ($2.6 billion) is dsa service revenue transferred over time.
income taxes we prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction's tax laws and regulations. in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. in performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. in making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected
36
future taxable income, and the effects of tax planning strategies. in the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
our valuation allowance increased by $300.2 million from $9.8 million as of december 29, 2018 to $310.0 million as of december 28, 2019. the increase is primarily related to the recognition of $315.5 million of net operating loss deferred tax assets due to changes in our financing structure, $294.9 million of which we do not believe is more likely than not to be utilized.
we account for uncertain tax positions using a "more-likely-than-not" threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors, that include, but are not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the "more-likely-than-not" threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the controversy process. we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews; we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position; and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would re-examine the related tax position. we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as u.s. tax reform. u.s. tax reform made broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code, including, but not limited to, (i) reducing the u.s. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%; (ii) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax (transition tax) on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (iii) generally eliminating u.s federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (iv) requiring a current inclusion in u.s. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations; (v) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (amt) and changing how existing amt credits can be realized; (vi) subjecting certain foreign earnings to u.s. taxation through base erosion anti-abuse tax (beat) and global intangible low-taxed income (gilti); (vii) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (viii) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after december 31, 2017, and (ix) modifying the officer's compensation limitation.
our accounting for the elements of u.s. tax reform is complete. we have made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due on the gilti inclusion as a current period expense. see note 11, "income taxes" for further discussion.
goodwill and intangible assets we use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. the determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques, such as the income approach and the cost approach, as appropriate, in establishing the fair value of intangible assets. typically, key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets.
in our recent acquisitions, customer relationship intangible assets (also referred to as client relationships) have been the most significant identifiable assets acquired. to determine the fair value of the acquired client relationships, we utilized the multiple period excess earnings model (a commonly accepted valuation technique), which includes the following key assumptions: projections of cash flows from the acquired entities, which included future revenue growth rates, operating income margins, and customer attrition rates; as well as discount rates based on an analysis of the acquired entities' weighted average cost of capital. the value of client relationships acquired were $134.6 million for citoxlab in fiscal year 2019 and $264.9 million for mpi research in fiscal year 2018.
we review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from
37
projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. no impairments were recognized during 2019, 2018 or 2017.
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment.
we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. if we elect this option and believe, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable, the quantitative two-step impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. alternatively, we may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and immediately perform the quantitative two-step impairment test. in the first step, we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. if the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units, then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill. if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.
in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, we elected to perform the quantitative first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test for our reporting units. fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of a market-based approach and an income approach, as this combination was deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. under the market-based approach, we utilized information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units. under the income approach, we determined fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.
our 2019, 2018 and 2017 impairment tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired.
valuation and impairment of long-lived assets long-lived assets to be held and used, including property, plant, and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following:
•   significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;
•   significant negative industry or economic trends; or
•   significant changes or developments in strategy or operations that negatively affect the utilization of our long-lived assets.
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset, net of any sublease income, if applicable, and its eventual disposition. in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to their fair values. we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows, including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets, as appropriate. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets.
in fiscal 2017, we recognized $17.7 million of asset impairment and accelerated depreciation charges on the rms facility in frederick, maryland in connection with our 2017 rms restructuring initiatives.
pension and other post-retirement benefit plans several of our u.s. and non-u.s. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. this
38
amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. we measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year end.
the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the expected return on plan assets, withdrawal and mortality rates, discount rate, and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. assumptions are determined based on our data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation.
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance.
the discount rate reflects the rate we would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle our current pension obligations. a 25 basis point change in the discount rate changes the projected benefit obligation by approximately $20 million for all our plans.
the rate of compensation increase reflects the expected annual salary increases for the plan participants based on historical experience and the current employee compensation strategy.
in fiscal year 2019, new mortality improvement scales were issued in the u.s. and u.k reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the 2018 releases that we adopted, which decreased our benefit obligations by $2.8 million as of december 28, 2019. in fiscal year 2018, new mortality improvement scales were issued in the u.s. and u.k. reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the 2017 releases that we adopted, which decreased our benefit obligations by $1.7 million as of december 29, 2018.
on january 31, 2019, we commenced the process to terminate the charles river laboratories, inc. pension plan (u.s. pension plan) and expect to complete the termination process during the second half of fiscal year 2020. as part of the planned termination, we re-balanced assets to better match the characteristics of the liabilities. at december 28, 2019, the u.s pension plan has a benefit obligation of $94.4 million and plan assets of $91.2 million. the benefit obligation has been valued at the amount expected to be required to settle the obligations. assumptions utilized considered the portion of obligations expected to be settled through participant acceptance of lump sum payments or annuities and the cost to purchase annuities, which are subject to change upon actual plan settlement. increasing the u.s pension plan's obligations to reflect the expected settlement value resulted in an actuarial loss of approximately $6 million, which was recorded within other comprehensive income as part of the annual revaluation for fiscal year 2019. upon settlement of the benefit obligation, pension losses currently deferred and recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets will be reclassified to other expense, net within our consolidated statement of income. as of december 28, 2019, we had unrecognized losses related to the u.s. pension plan of approximately $14 million.
stock-based compensation we grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (rsus), and performance share units (psus) to employees, and stock options, restricted stock, and rsus to non-employee directors under stock-based compensation plans. we make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our stock-based compensation arrangements. changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the timing and amount of expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments. stock-based compensation is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income based on the grant date fair value, adjusted for forfeitures when they occur, over the requisite service period.
determining the appropriate valuation model and related assumptions requires judgment. the fair value of stock options granted is calculated using the black-scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of psus is estimated using a lattice model with a monte carlo simulation, both of which require the use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term, among others.
determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of psu's performance targets requires judgment, including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets. the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets. the cumulative impact of any changes to our estimates is reflected in the period of change.

rms revenue increased $17.4 million, or 3.3%, due primarily to higher research model services revenue and higher research model product revenue in china. research model services benefited from a large government contract in the is business and strong client demand in the gems business resulting from increased research and development activity conducted across biotechnology and academic institutional clients. partially offsetting these increases were the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and lower research model product revenue outside of china, particularly from large biopharmaceutical clients.

rms operating income decreased $2.6 million, or 1.9%, compared to the corresponding period in 2018. rms operating income as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2019 was 24.9%, a decrease of 1.4% from 26.3% for the corresponding period in 2018. operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to higher cost of revenue and selling, general, and administrative expenses to support the growth of the businesses, which included the following: a $2.2 million charge recorded within selling, general and administrative costs in fiscal year 2019 in connection with the modification of the option to purchase the remaining 8% equity interest in vital river, increased investments in personnel (staffing levels and hourly wage increases), higher severance charges in connection with certain global restructuring initiatives, and facility expansions (primarily in china). in addition, operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased due to lower operating income margins on the aforementioned large government contract, and lower sales volume for research models outside of china.

dsa revenue increased $302.1 million, or 22.9%, due primarily to the recent acquisitions of citoxlab and mpi research, which contributed $123.7 million and $73.0 million, respectively, to service revenue growth. additionally, service revenue increased in both the safety assessment and discovery services businesses due to demand from biotechnology clients and increased pricing of services. these increases were partially offset by the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
dsa operating income increased $31.3 million, or 13.8%, compared to the corresponding period in 2018. dsa operating income as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2019 was 16.0%, a decrease of 1.3% from 17.3% for the corresponding period in 2018. the increase to operating income was primarily attributable to contributions from our recent acquisitions of citoxlab and mpi research. this increase was partially offset by increased costs in both cost of revenue and selling, general, and administrative expenses to support the growth of the businesses, which included the following: increased investments in personnel (staffing levels and hourly wage increases); increased investments related to facility expansions; higher severance charges in connection with certain global restructuring initiatives, and higher amortization of intangible assets and acquisition and integration costs associated with our recent acquisitions. these increased costs collectively decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue in 2019 compared to 2018.

manufacturing revenue increased $35.6 million, or 8.3%, due primarily to higher demand for endotoxin products, bioburden products and services, and species identification services in the microbial solutions business and higher service revenue in the biologics business; partially offset by the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
manufacturing operating income increased $9.2 million, or 6.8%, compared to the corresponding period in 2018. manufacturing operating income as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2019 was 31.3%, a decrease of 0.4% from 31.7% for the corresponding period in 2018. the increase to operating income was due primarily to the increase in revenue. this increase

was partially offset by increased costs in both cost of revenue and selling, general, and administrative expenses to support the growth of the businesses, which included the following: increased investments in process improvements to further enhance microbial solutions' operating efficiency; increased investments in personnel (staffing levels and hourly wage increases), and increased investments related to facility expansions (primarily in biologics), and certain site consolidation costs. these increased costs collectively decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue in 2019 compared to 2018.

unallocated corporate costs consist of selling, general and administrative expenses that are not directly related or allocated to the reportable segments. the increase in unallocated corporate costs of $18.1 million, or 10.8%, compared to the corresponding period in 2018 is related to an increase in compensation, benefits, and other employee-related expenses; costs associated with the evaluation and integration of our recent acquisition activity; and costs related to the remediation of the unauthorized access into our information systems. costs as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2019 was 7.1%, a decrease of 0.4% from 7.5% for the corresponding period in 2018.
interest income interest income, which represents earnings on cash, cash equivalents, and time deposits was $1.5 million and $0.8 million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. the increase of $0.7 million was primarily due to higher average cash balances in 2019 as compared to 2018.
interest expense interest expense for fiscal year 2019 was $60.9 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 4.5%, compared to $63.8 million for fiscal year 2018. the decrease was due primarily to a foreign currency gain recognized in connection with a debt-related foreign exchange forward contract and lower debt issuance costs incurred compared to the corresponding period in 2018; partially offset by higher interest expense from increased debt to fund our recent acquisitions.
other income, net other income, net, was $12.3 million for fiscal year 2019, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 7.3%, compared to $13.3 million for fiscal year 2018. the decrease was due to higher foreign currency losses recognized in connection with a u.s. dollar denominated loan borrowed by a non-u.s. entity with a different functional currency compared to the corresponding period in 2018 and higher pension-related costs as compared to the corresponding period in 2018; partially offset by higher net gains on our venture capital investments and our life insurance policy investments compared to the corresponding period in 2018.
income taxes income tax expense was $50.0 million for fiscal year 2019, a decrease of $4.5 million, compared to $54.5 million for fiscal year 2018. our effective tax rate was 16.5% for fiscal year 2019, compared to 19.3% for fiscal year 2018. the decrease in our effective tax rate in the 2019 period compared to the 2018 period was primarily due to recognizing a $20.6 million deferred tax asset in fiscal year 2019 for net operating losses expected to be utilized in the future due to changes in our international financing structure.

rms revenue increased $26.1 million, or 5.3%, due primarily to higher research model product revenue in china and higher revenue for research model services. research model services benefited from a large government contract in the is business and strong client demand in the gems business resulting from increased research and development activity conducted across biotechnology, global biopharmaceutical, and academic institutional clients, and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates; partially offset by lower research model product revenue outside of china.
rms operating income increased $21.9 million, or 19.1%, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. rms operating income as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2018 was 26.3%, an increase of 3.1% from 23.2% for the corresponding period in 2017. operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue increased due primarily to lower amount of costs associated with the realignment of our research model production site in maryland in 2018 compared to 2017. restructuring costs (recorded primarily within cost of revenue) incurred during 2017 were $18.1 million, which primarily related to non-cash asset impairments and accelerated depreciation charges. restructuring costs incurred during 2018 were $2.0 million, which primarily related to cash payments for severance and transition costs. additionally, operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue increased due to the increased revenue discussed above; partially offset by continued investments to support future growth, including increased investments in personnel (staffing levels and hourly wage increases), and facility expansions (primarily in china) as well as lower operating income margins on the aforementioned large government contract.

the increase in unallocated corporate costs of $35.9 million, or 27.0%, is consistent with the allocated selling, general, and administrative expense increases discussed above and are primarily related to an increase in compensation, benefits, and other employee-related expenses and an increase in costs associated with the evaluation and integration of our recent acquisitions to support the growth of the company. costs as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2018 was 7.5%, an increase of 0.3% from 7.2% for the corresponding period in 2017.
interest income interest income, which represents earnings on cash, cash equivalents, and time deposits remained consistent at $0.8 million and $0.7 million for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.
interest expense interest expense for fiscal year 2018 was $63.8 million, an increase of $34.0 million, or 114.2%, compared to $29.8 million for fiscal year 2017. the increase was due primarily to higher debt to fund our recent acquisitions.
other income, net other income, net, was $13.3 million for fiscal year 2018, a decrease of $24.5 million, or 64.9%, compared to $37.8 million for fiscal year 2017. the decrease in other income, net was driven by a decrease of $7.0 million in gains recognized related to our venture capital investments, a decrease of $6.0 million in gains related to certain life insurance policies, and the absence of a $10.6 million gain recognized as a result of the cdmo business.
income taxes income tax expense was $54.5 million for fiscal year 2018, a decrease of $116.9 million, compared to $171.4 million for fiscal year 2017. our effective tax rate was 19.3% for fiscal year 2018, compared to 57.7% for fiscal year 2017. the decrease was primarily driven by the net effects of u.s. tax reform, including the reduction of the u.s. federal statutory tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018, as well as the impact of the one-time transition tax and change of our assertion of indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings in 2017. in addition, 2017 includes the impact of the gain on the divestiture of the cdmo business.
liquidity and capital resources we currently require cash to fund our working capital needs, capital expansion, acquisitions, and to pay our debt, lease, venture capital investment, and pension obligations. our principal sources of liquidity have been our cash flows from operations, supplemented by long-term borrowings. based on our current business plan, we believe that our existing funds, when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to financing resources, are sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.

net cash provided by cash flows from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our income from continuing operations for (1) non-cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, gains on venture capital investments and divestiture, and impairment charges, as well as (2) changes in operating assets and liabilities, which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in our results of operations. for fiscal year 2019, compared to fiscal year 2018, the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by an increase in income from continuing operations, net of income taxes

and the favorable timing of vendor and supplier payments compared to the same period in 2018; partially offset by unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities, specifically related to the timing of net contract balances from contracts with customers (collectively trade receivables, net; deferred revenue; and customer contract deposits), increases in inventory levels in response to customer demand, and higher compensation payments compared to the prior year period. the increase in net cash provided by operating activities from fiscal year 2017 to 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in income from continuing operations and positive changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from an increase in our deferred revenue (primarily due to a one-time up-front payment received in connection with a strategic agreement), an increase in customer contract deposits, as well as improved collections of our receivables.

item 1a. risk factors various risks and uncertainties could affect our business. any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.
we rely heavily on information technology in our operations, and insufficient guest or employee facing technology or a failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network, free from material failure, interruption or security breach, could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and/or result in the loss of respected relationships with our guests or employees.
we rely heavily on information systems across our operations, including for e-commerce, marketing programs, employee engagement, management of our supply chain, the point-of-sale processing system in our restaurants, and various other processes and transactions. our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability, security and capacity of these systems. in addition, we must effectively respond to changing guest expectations and new technological developments. disruptions, failures or other performance issues with guest facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our guests. the failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, a material network breach in the security of these systems as a result of a cyber attack, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to our company, our employees or our guests. this could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or sensitive financial information, or the improper use of personal information or other "identity theft" of either guest or employee information. some of these essential business processes that are dependent on technology are outsourced to third parties. while we make efforts to ensure that our providers are observing proper standards and controls, we cannot guarantee that breaches or failures caused by these outsourced providers will not occur.
any such failures, disruptions or data privacy breaches may cause delays in guest service, reduce efficiency in our operations, require significant capital investments to remediate the problem, result in customer, employee or advertiser dissatisfaction or otherwise result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation. we could also be subjected to litigation, regulatory investigations or the imposition of penalties. as privacy and information security laws and regulations change and cyber risks evolve, we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance and protect guest, employee and company information.
a failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.
food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe, quality food products.  even with strong preventative interventions and controls, food safety issues could be caused at the source or by food suppliers or distributors and, as a result, be out of our control and require prompt action to mitigate impact.  in addition, regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses such as e. coli, hepatitis a, norovirus or salmonella, and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination, at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales. even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales. the occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.
the inability to hire, train, reward and retain restaurant team members or an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction may impact our ability to achieve our operating, growth and financial objectives.
our future growth depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain high-quality team members to work in and manage our restaurants. adequate staffing of qualified restaurant team members is a critical factor impacting our guests' experience in our restaurants. maintaining adequate staffing in our existing restaurants and hiring and training staff for our new restaurants requires precise workforce planning. the low level of unemployment in the united states is resulting in aggressive competition for talent, wage inflation and pressure to improve benefits and workplace conditions to remain competitive. a shortage of quality candidates who meet all legal citizenship or work authorization requirements, failure to recruit and retain new team members in a timely manner or higher than expected turnover levels all could affect our ability to open new restaurants, grow sales at existing restaurants or meet our labor cost objectives. an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to team member dissatisfaction could lead to poor guest satisfaction, higher turnover, litigation and unionization which could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets.
a failure to recruit, develop and retain effective leaders or the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills could impact our strategic direction and jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets.
our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other leadership team members. we must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management team members in order to achieve our current business objectives and support our projected growth. changes in senior management could expose us to significant changes in strategic direction and initiatives. a failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support leadership excellence (adequate resources, innovative skill sets and expectations) and build adequate bench strength required for growth or a loss of key skill sets could jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets.
we are subject to a number of risks relating to public policy changes and federal, state and local regulation of our business, including in the areas of health care reform, environmental matters, minimum wage, unionization, data privacy, menu labeling, immigration requirements and taxes, and an insufficient or ineffective response to legislation or government regulation may impact our cost structure, operational efficiencies and talent availability.
the restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws and regulations. the development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to building, zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements. we are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages. we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. we are subject to federal, state, and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions.  these laws cover minimum wage rates, wage and hour practices, labor relations, paid and family leave, workplace safety, and immigration, among others.  the myriad of laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level creates unique challenges for a multi-state employer as different standards apply to different locations, sometimes with conflicting requirements.  we must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws and regulations.
we also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the ada. compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings, and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation. new or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our labor costs.
we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials. there also has been increasing focus by united states and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption. this increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating a yet to be specified array of environmental matters. legislative, regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities, which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment.
we are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. an increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information. compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly, and any failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws or any breach of our systems could harm our reputation or lead to litigation, which could adversely affect our financial condition.
the impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could negatively impact our cost structure, operational efficiencies and talent availability, and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.
litigation, including allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, guests, suppliers, business partners, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. these actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination; guest discrimination; food safety issues including poor food quality, food-borne illness, food tampering, food contamination, and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or high-calorie foods (including obesity); other personal injury; violation of "dram shop" laws (providing an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party); trademark infringement; violation of the federal securities laws; or other concerns. the outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. the cost to defend litigation may be significant. there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease guest acceptance of our brands, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable. litigation could impact our operations in other ways as well. allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, for example, could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention. as a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
unfavorable publicity, or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity, could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales.
the good reputation of our restaurant brands is a key factor in the success of our business. actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could harm our brands. even incidents occurring at restaurants operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that could harm the restaurant industry overall and, indirectly, our own brands. negative publicity may result from allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, employee dissatisfaction, guest discrimination, illness, injury, or any of the other matters discussed above that could give rise to litigation. regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid, unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants, or to only a single restaurant, could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand. negative publicity also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu outbreaks, publication of government or industry findings concerning food products, environmental disasters, crime incidents, data privacy breaches, scandals involving our employees, or operational problems at our restaurants, all of which could make our brands and menu offerings less appealing to our guests and negatively impact our guest counts and sales. adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands, or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business.
there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons.  many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted.  information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each of which may harm our performance, prospects, or business.  the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.  the dissemination of information online could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information's accuracy.
many of our competitors are expanding their use of social media and new social media platforms are rapidly being developed, potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete. as a result, we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance. as part of our marketing efforts, we rely on social media platforms and search engine marketing to attract and retain guests. we also continue to invest in other digital marketing initiatives that allow us to reach our guests across multiple digital channels and build their awareness of, engagement with, and loyalty to our brands. these initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues, increased employee engagement or brand recognition. in addition, a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about us, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, or out-of-date information. the inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.
a majority of our restaurants are operated in leased properties and we are committed to long-term and non-cancelable leases that we may want to cancel, and may be unable to renew the leases that we may want to extend at the end of their terms.
as of may 26, 2019, 1,715 of our 1,785 restaurants operating in the united states and canada operate in leased locations. if we close a restaurant in a leased location, we may remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which would include, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. additionally, the potential losses associated with our inability to cancel leases may result in our keeping open restaurant locations that are performing significantly below targeted levels. as a result, ongoing lease obligations at closed or underperforming restaurant locations could impair our results of operations. in addition, at the end of the lease term and expiration of all renewal periods, we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all. as a result, we may be required to close or relocate a restaurant, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks, and may have an adverse effect on our operating performance.
we may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs.
our restaurant operations are subject to united states and canadian federal, state and local laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions, overtime and tip credits. as federal, state and local minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees, but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care and other benefit mandates could also increase our labor costs. this in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales. conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our profitability may decline. in addition, the current premiums that we pay for our insurance (including workers' compensation, general liability, property, health, and directors' and officers' liability) may increase at any time, thereby further increasing our costs. the dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers' compensation and general liability insurance, for which we carry high per-claim deductibles, may also increase at any time, thereby further increasing our costs. further, the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses.
our inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as a hurricane or manmade disaster, including terrorism, at our corporate facility could have a materially adverse impact on our business.
many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one florida location. we have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including hurricanes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. however, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.
health concerns arising from food-related pandemics, outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business.
the united states and other countries have experienced, or may experience in the future, outbreaks of viruses, such as norovirus, avian flu or "sars," h1n1 or "swine flu," or other diseases. to the extent that a virus or disease is food-borne, or perceived to be food-borne, future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product, or could reduce public confidence in food handling and/or public assembly. for example, public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of chicken, eggs and other products derived from poultry. the inability to serve poultry-based products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests. if we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns, we may lose guests who do not prefer the new menu, and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new guest base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable. we also may have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors. if a virus is transmitted by human contact, our employees or guests could become infected, or could choose, or be advised, to avoid gathering in public places, any of which could adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants, receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level. we also could be adversely affected if the world health organization and/or the centers for disease control were to restrict travel to affected geographic areas where we source our products, thus possibly impacting the continuity of supply. additionally, jurisdictions in which we have restaurants may impose mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations. even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business.
we face intense competition, and if we have an insufficient focus on competition and the consumer landscape, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
the full-service dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing, service, location, personnel, take-out and delivery options and type and quality of food, and there are many well-established competitors. we compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locally-owned restaurants. we also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services, particularly in the supermarket industry which offers "convenient meals" in the form of improved entrées, side dishes or meal preparation kits from the deli or prepared foods sections. we compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items. the number and location of restaurants, type of brand, quality and efficiency of service, attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors. we anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors. if we are unable to continue to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
we are subject to changes in consumer preferences that may adversely affect demand for food at our restaurants.
consumers have continually changing health and dietary preferences. as a result, our diverse portfolio of restaurant brands are continually challenged to evolve our menu offerings to appeal to these changing customer preferences, while maintaining our brand character and retaining popular menu items. new information or changes in dietary, nutritional, allergen or health guidelines or environmental or sustainability concerns, whether issued by government agencies, academic studies, advocacy organizations or similar groups, may cause some groups of consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our restaurants. if we fail to anticipate changing trends or other consumer preferences, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
our failure to drive both short-term and long-term profitable sales growth through brand relevance, operating excellence, opening new restaurants of existing brands, and acquiring new dining brands could result in poor financial performance.
as part of our business strategy, we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing same-restaurant sales at existing restaurants, continuing to expand our current portfolio of restaurant brands, and acquiring additional brands that can be expanded profitably. this strategy involves numerous risks, and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives.
at existing brands, we may not be able to maintain brand relevance and restaurant operating excellence to achieve sustainable same-restaurant sales growth and warrant new unit growth. existing brand short-term sales growth could be impacted if we are unable to drive near term guest count and sales growth, and long-term sales growth could be impacted if we fail to extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to our guests. a failure to innovate and extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to guests and occasions in order to generate sustainable same-restaurant traffic growth and produce non-traditional sales and earnings growth opportunities, insufficient focus on our competition, or failure to adequately address declines in the casual dining industry, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. in addition, we may not be able to support sustained new unit growth or open all of our planned new restaurants, and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants. new restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize, and even sales at successful newly-opened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation. the opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on guest counts and sales levels at existing restaurants.
the ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks, such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations, the need to obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals and liquor licenses) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors, the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets, the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction, increases in labor and building material costs, the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms, changes in weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time, our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions. at each potential location, we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites, construction contractors, management personnel, hourly employees and other resources. if we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods.
we also may not be able to identify and successfully acquire and integrate additional brands that are as profitable as our existing restaurants or that provide potential for further growth.
a lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations.
the success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations. as demographic and economic patterns change, current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable. possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations. in addition, desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation. the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
we may experience higher-than-anticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing, relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing, relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants. we incur substantial pre-opening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close, relocate or remodel existing restaurants. the expenses of opening, closing, relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated. an increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
a failure to identify and execute innovative marketing and guest relationship tactics, ineffective or improper use of other marketing initiatives, and increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations.
if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions, if our advertising, media or marketing expenses increase, if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors, or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise competitive insight, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations. a failure to sufficiently innovate, develop guest relationship initiatives, or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales.
as part of our marketing efforts, we rely on social media platforms and search engine marketing to attract and retain guests. these initiatives may not be successful, and pose a variety of other risks, as discussed above under the heading: "our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business."
a failure to address cost pressures, including rising costs for commodities, labor, health care and utilities used by our restaurants, and a failure to effectively deliver cost management activities and achieve economies of scale in purchasing could compress our margins and adversely affect our sales and results of operations.
our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food, ingredients, labor, health care, utilities and other related costs over which we may have little control. operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, cheese, butter and produce. the introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported food products, such as produce and seafood, could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products. we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices, menu offerings, and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results. we attempt to leverage our size to achieve economies of scale in purchasing, but there can be no assurances that we can always do so effectively. we are also subject to the general risks of inflation.
increases in minimum wage, health care and other benefit costs may have a material adverse effect on our labor costs. we operate in many states and localities where the minimum wage is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage. increases in minimum wage may also result in increases in the wage rates paid for non-minimum wage positions. many states and localities are also passing laws regulating employment practices and working conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our labor costs in those areas.
our restaurants' operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas, whether as a result of inflation or otherwise, on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply. in addition, interruptions to the availability of gas, electric, water or other utilities, whether due to aging infrastructure, weather conditions, fire, animal damage, trees, digging accidents or other reasons largely out of our control, may adversely affect our operations. our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
we may lose sales or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages, delays or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers.
shortages, delays or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants may be caused by inclement weather; natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and earthquakes; labor issues or other operational disruptions at our suppliers, vendors or other service providers; the inability of our vendors or service providers to manage adverse business conditions, obtain credit or remain solvent; or other conditions beyond our control. such shortages, delays or interruptions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. we have a limited number of suppliers and distributors for certain of our products and services. supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations. if we raise prices as a result of increased food costs or shortages, it may negatively impact our sales. if we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant's menu, that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our guests changing their dining habits.
adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect our restaurant sales.
adverse weather conditions can impact guest traffic at our restaurants, cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating and, in more severe cases such as hurricanes, tornadoes or other natural disasters, cause temporary closures, sometimes for prolonged periods, which would negatively impact our restaurant sales. changes in weather could result in construction delays, interruptions to the availability of utilities, and shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies, which could increase our costs. some climatologists predict that the long-term effects of climate change and global warming may result in more severe, volatile weather or extended droughts, which could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations.
volatility in the market value of derivatives we may use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity and broader market prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings.
we use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient, labor and energy costs, including but not limited to coffee, butter, wheat, soybean oil, pork, beef, diesel fuel, gasoline and natural gas. changes in the values of these derivatives may be recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. these gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings included in our consolidated financial statements.
certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and other general macroeconomic factors including unemployment, energy prices and interest rates that are largely beyond our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and our results of operations.
our business results depend on a number of industry-specific and general economic factors, many of which are beyond our control. the full-service dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in international, national, regional and local economic conditions, seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes, consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences, including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits, and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands. the performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends, severe weather including hurricanes, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants.
general economic conditions may also adversely affect our results of operations. recessionary economic cycles, a protracted economic slowdown, a worsening economy, increased unemployment, increased energy prices, rising interest rates, a downgrade of the u.s. government's long-term credit rating, imposition of retaliatory tariffs on important u.s. imports and exports or other industry-wide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings. job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause guests to make fewer discretionary purchases, and any significant decrease in our guest traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance. in addition, if gasoline, natural gas, electricity and other energy costs increase, and credit card, home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates, our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency of their dining occasions, may spend less on each dining occasion or may choose more inexpensive restaurants.
furthermore, we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, heightened security requirements, or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure, such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems, could have on our operations, the economy or consumer confidence generally. any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures.
unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our guests could increase our costs, reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing, any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition and results of operations.
disruptions in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact consumer spending patterns, affect the availability and cost of credit and increase pension plan expenses.
our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. turmoil in global credit markets could adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged, and the availability and cost of credit in the future. there can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins. a lack of credit could have an adverse impact on certain of our suppliers, landlords and other tenants in retail centers in which we are located. if these issues occur, they could negatively affect our financial results. any new disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the u.s. and world economy, which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns. changes in the capital markets could also have significant effects on our pension plan. our pension income or expense is affected by factors including the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for the pension plan for some of our employees, the weighted average asset allocation and long-term rate of return of our pension plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the interest cost component of our net periodic pension cost.
we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees and licensees.
certain of our domestic and all of our international locations other than in canada are operated by franchisees or licensees. we believe that we have selected high-caliber operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations, and are providing them with training and support. however, the probability of opening, ultimate success and quality of any franchise or licensed restaurant rests principally with the franchisee or licensee. if the franchisee or licensee does not successfully open and operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards, or guests have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution, our brand values could suffer, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with business partners and vendors in foreign markets.
we are making efforts to expand our brands overseas through licensing and franchising relationships. there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue. our international operations are subject to all of the same risks associated with our domestic operations, as well as a number of additional risks. these include, among other things, international economic and political conditions, foreign currency fluctuations, and differing cultures and consumer preferences. in addition, expansion into international markets could create risks to our brands and reputation.
we also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors. these include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs regulations and other international trade regulations, the usa patriot act, the foreign corrupt practices act, and applicable local law. failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business.
we regard our olive garden®, longhorn steakhouse®, cheddar's scratch kitchen®, yard house®, the capital grille®, the capital burger ®, seasons 52®, bahama breeze®, eddie v's prime seafood®, darden® and darden restaurants® service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts. we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws, to protect our restaurants and services from infringement. we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the united states and foreign jurisdictions. however, we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons. although our policy is to oppose any such infringement, further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business. in addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant. although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate, and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources.
impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired. a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment of goodwill exists. factors may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates. any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. we compute the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired.
we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, primarily the longhorn steakhouse®, cheddar's scratch kitchen®, the capital grille®, yard house® and eddie v's prime seafood® trademarks, to determine if they are definite or indefinite-lived. reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.
as with goodwill, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks) for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of these assets. should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
changes in tax laws or treaties and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results.
we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions. our effective income tax rate and other taxes in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or other legislative changes, including the tax cuts and jobs act (tax act), certain international tax treaties and the outcome of income tax audits. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of a tax audit could have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. in addition, our effective income tax rate and our results may be impacted by our ability to realize deferred tax benefits and by any increases or decreases of our valuation allowances applied to our existing deferred tax assets. additional tax regulations and interpretations of the tax act are expected to be issued, and no assurance can be made that future guidance will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
failure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results, affect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results.
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting. any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. a significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock, increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.
a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is effective. new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. changes to existing accounting rules or the application of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results. additionally, our assumptions, estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including but not limited to, revenue recognition, fair value of investments, impairment of long-lived assets, leases and related economic transactions, derivatives, pension and post-retirement benefits, intangibles, self-insurance, income taxes, property and equipment, unclaimed property laws and litigation, and stock-based compensation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by us. changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis below for darden restaurants, inc. (darden, the company, we, us or our) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related financial statement notes included in part ii of this report under the caption "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data." we operate on a 52/53-week fiscal year, which ends on the last sunday in may. fiscal 2019, which ended may 26, 2019, consisted of 52 weeks and fiscal 2018, which ended may 27, 2018, consisted of 52 weeks.
overview of operations our business operates in the full-service dining segment of the restaurant industry. at may 26, 2019, we operated 1,785 restaurants through subsidiaries in the united states and canada under the olive garden®, longhorn steakhouse®, cheddar's scratch kitchen®, yard house®, the capital grille®, seasons 52®, bahama breeze® and eddie v's prime seafood® trademarks. we own and operate all of our restaurants in the united states and canada, except for 3 joint venture restaurants managed by us and 37 franchised restaurants. we also have 33 franchised restaurants in operation located in latin america and the middle east. all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
we believe that capable operators of strong, multi-unit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the restaurant industry's full-service segment. generally, the restaurant industry is considered to be comprised of three segments: quick service, fast casual, and full service. all of our restaurants fall within the full-service segment, which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains.  we believe we have strong brands and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the full-service segment of the restaurant industry. this collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business, including restaurant operations excellence, brand management excellence, supply chain, talent management and information technology, among other things.
with a focus on growing same-restaurant sales, we've implemented a "back-to-basics" approach rooted in strong operating fundamentals.  we're focused on improving culinary innovation and execution inside each of our brands, delivering attentive service to each and every one of our guests, and creating an inviting and engaging atmosphere inside our restaurants.  we support these priorities with smart and relevant integrated marketing programs that resonate with our guests.  by delivering on these operational and brand-building imperatives, we expect to increase our market share through new restaurant and same-restaurant sales growth and deliver best-in-class profitability.
the darden support structure enables our brands to achieve their ultimate potential through: (1) driving advantages in supply chain and general and administrative support; (2) applying insights collected from our significant guest and transactional databases to enhance guest relationships and identify new opportunities to drive sales growth; (3) relentlessly driving operating efficiencies and continuous improvement, operating with a sense of urgency and inspiring a performance-driven culture; and (4) our commitment to rigorous strategic planning.
we seek to increase profits by leveraging our fixed and semi-fixed costs with sales from new restaurants and increased guest traffic and sales at existing restaurants. to evaluate our operations and assess our financial performance, we monitor a number of operating measures, with a special focus on two key factors:
•   same-restaurant sales - which is a year-over-year 52-week comparison of each period's sales volumes for restaurants open at least 16 months; and
•   segment profit - which is restaurant sales, less food and beverage costs, restaurant labor costs, restaurant expenses and marketing expenses (sometimes referred to as restaurant-level earnings).
increasing same-restaurant sales can improve segment profit because these incremental sales provide better leverage of our fixed and semi-fixed restaurant-level costs. a restaurant brand can generate same-restaurant sales increases through increases in guest traffic, increases in the average guest check, or a combination of the two. the average guest check can be impacted by menu price changes and by the mix of menu items sold. for each restaurant brand, we gather daily sales data and regularly analyze the guest traffic counts and the mix of menu items sold to aid in developing menu pricing, product offerings and promotional strategies. we focus on balancing our pricing and product offerings with other initiatives to produce sustainable same-restaurant sales growth. we compute same-restaurant sales using restaurants open at least 16 months because this period is generally required for new restaurant sales levels to normalize. sales at newly opened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation due to operating or integration inefficiencies. our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of new restaurant openings and closings, and relocations and remodeling of existing restaurants. pre-opening expenses each period reflect the costs associated with opening new restaurants in current and future periods.

fiscal 2019 financial highlights our sales from continuing operations were $8.51 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $8.08 billion in fiscal 2018. the 5.3 percent increase in sales from continuing operations was primarily driven by revenue from the addition of 39 net new company-owned restaurants and a combined darden same-restaurant sales increase of 2.5 percent.
net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2019 were $718.6 million ($5.73 per diluted share) compared with net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 of $603.8 million ($4.79 per diluted share). net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2019 increased 19.0 percent and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 19.6 percent compared with fiscal 2018.
our net loss from discontinued operations was $5.2 million ($0.04 per diluted share) for fiscal 2019, compared with a net loss from discontinued operations of $7.8 million ($0.06 per diluted share) for fiscal 2018. when combined with results from continuing operations, our diluted net earnings per share were $5.69 and $4.73 for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.
outlook we expect fiscal 2020 sales from continuing operations to increase between 5.3 percent and 6.3 percent, driven by the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2020, combined darden same-restaurant sales growth of 1.0 percent to 2.0 percent and approximately 50 new restaurants. in fiscal 2020, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be between 10.0 percent and 11.0 percent and we expect capital expenditures incurred to build new restaurants, remodel and maintain existing restaurants and technology initiatives to be between $450.0 million and $500.0 million.
in june 2019, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.88 per share, payable on august 1, 2019. based on the $0.88 quarterly dividend declaration, our expected annual dividend is $3.52 per share, which reflects an increase of 17.3 percent compared to our fiscal 2019 annual dividend. dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors and, accordingly, the timing and amount of our dividends are subject to change.

total operating costs and expenses from continuing operations were $7.68 billion in fiscal 2019 and $7.31 billion in fiscal 2018.
fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018:
•   food and beverage costs decreased as a percent of sales primarily due to a 0.5% impact from pricing and a 0.3% impact related to cost savings initiatives, partially offset by a 0.7% impact from unfavorable menu mix and inflation.
•   restaurant labor costs increased as a percent of sales primarily due to a 1.2% impact from inflation and a 0.2% impact related to workforce reinvestment costs, partially offset by a 0.6% impact from pricing leverage and a 0.7% impact from sales leverage and improved productivity.
•   general and administrative expenses decreased as a percent of sales primarily driven by a 0.2% impact due to expenses incurred in fiscal 2018 related to the integration of cheddar's scratch kitchen and a 0.3% impact related to sales leverage.
•   impairments and disposal of assets, net increased as a percent of sales due to fiscal 2019 restaurant impairments in excess of fiscal 2018 restaurant impairments.
interest expense net interest expense decreased as a percent of sales in fiscal 2019 primarily due to debt retirement costs of $102.2 million incurred in fiscal 2018 associated with the retirement of $310.9 million aggregate principal amount of long-term debt.
income taxes the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2019 and 2018 for continuing operations were 8.1 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively. the increase in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the favorable impact in fiscal 2018 of the tax cuts and jobs act (tax act), which included a $79.3 million one-time adjustment of our net deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding income tax benefit reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings. the impact of the deferred tax adjustment was partially offset by a benefit in fiscal 2019 due to the lower federal corporate tax rate of 21.0 percent compared with the 29.4 percent blended federal corporate tax rate in effect for fiscal 2018.
net earnings and net earnings per share from continuing operations net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2019 were $718.6 million ($5.73 per diluted share) compared with net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 of $603.8 million ($4.79 per diluted share).
net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2019 increased 19.0 percent and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 19.6 percent compared with fiscal 2018. our diluted per share results from continuing operations were positively impacted by the tax act by approximately $0.52 in fiscal 2019 due to the lower federal corporate tax rate of 21.0 percent as compared with the 29.4 percent blended federal corporate tax rate in effect for fiscal 2018. our diluted per share results from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 were positively impacted by the tax act by approximately $0.62 due to a net benefit from deferred tax revaluation. our diluted per share results from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 were adversely impacted by approximately $0.54 related to debt retirement costs and approximately $0.10 related to costs associated with the integration of cheddar's scratch kitchen.
loss from discontinued operations on an after-tax basis, results from discontinued operations for fiscal 2019 were a net loss of $5.2 million ($0.04 per diluted share) compared with a net loss for fiscal 2018 of $7.8 million ($0.06 per diluted share).
segment results we manage our restaurant brands, olive garden, longhorn steakhouse, cheddar's scratch kitchen, yard house, the capital grille, seasons 52, bahama breeze and eddie v's in the u.s. and canada as operating segments. we aggregate our operating segments into reportable segments based on a combination of the size, economic characteristics and sub-segment of full-service dining within which each brand operates. our four reportable segments are: (1) olive garden, (2) longhorn steakhouse, (3) fine dining and (4) other business. see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this report) for further details.
our management uses segment profit as the measure for assessing performance of our segments. the following table presents segment profit margin for the periods indicated:
fiscal year ended                   change segment               may 26, 2019           may 27, 2018             2019 vs 2018

results of operations for fiscal 2018 compared to 2017
for a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended may 27, 2018 and may 28, 2017, see "part ii, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended may 27, 2018, filed with the sec on july 20, 2018.
seasonality our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally. typically, our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring, followed by the summer, and lowest in the fall. holidays, changes in the economy, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.
impact of inflation we attempt to minimize the annual effects of inflation through appropriate planning, operating practices and menu price increases. we do not believe inflation had a significant overall effect on our annual results of operations during fiscal 2019 or 2018.
critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates.
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this report). judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. we consider the following estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
leases we evaluate our leases at their inception to estimate their expected term, which commences on the date when we have the right to control the use of the leased property and includes the non-cancelable base term plus all option periods we are reasonably assured to exercise. our judgment in determining the appropriate expected term for each lease affects our evaluation of:
•   the classification and accounting for leases as capital versus operating;
•   the rent holidays and escalation in payments that are included in the calculation of straight-line rent; and
•   the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant facility are amortized.
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation, amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different expected lease terms were used.
valuation of long-lived assets land, buildings and equipment and certain other assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. the judgments we make related to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets, definitions of lease terms and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of these assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in usage or operating performance, desirability of the restaurant sites and other factors, such as our ability to sell our assets held for sale. as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, significant adverse changes in these factors could cause us to realize an impairment loss. based on a review of operating results for each of our restaurants, the amount of net book value associated with lower performing restaurants that would be deemed at risk for impairment is not material to our consolidated financial statements.
valuation and recoverability of goodwill and trademarks goodwill and trademarks are not subject to amortization and have been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. the reporting units are our restaurant brands. a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates. any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. we review our goodwill and trademarks for impairment annually, as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. each reporting unit's fair value is compared to its carrying value.
we estimate fair value of each reporting unit using the best information available, including market information (also referred to as the market approach) and discounted cash flow projections (also referred to as the income approach). a market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow and sales multiples to the reporting unit's operating performance. the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units. the income approach uses a reporting unit's projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions. we recognize an impairment loss when the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
we estimate the fair value of trademarks using the relief-from-royalty method, which requires assumptions related to projected sales from our annual long-range plan; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks; and a discount rate. we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value.
we performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and trademarks as of the first day of our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter. as of the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter, we had eight reporting units, six of which had goodwill and seven of which had trademarks. as a result of the impairment tests, no indicators of impairment were identified and no additional indicators of impairment were identified through the end of our fourth fiscal quarter that would require us to test further for impairment. however, changes in circumstances existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future, such as declines in our market capitalization (reflected in our stock price) as well as in the market capitalization of other companies in the restaurant industry, declines in sales at our restaurants, and significant adverse changes in the operating environment for the restaurant industry could result in an impairment loss of all or a portion of our goodwill or trademarks. the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by at least 40 percent and the fair value of each reporting unit's trademark exceeded its carrying value by at least 20 percent.
if our annual test resulted in an impairment of our goodwill or trademarks, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected and our leverage ratio for purposes of our credit agreement would increase. a leverage ratio exceeding the maximum permitted under our credit agreement would be a default under our credit agreement. at may 26, 2019, a write-down of goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets, or any other assets in excess of approximately $1.28 billion would have been required to cause our leverage ratio to exceed the permitted maximum. as our leverage ratio is determined on a quarterly basis, and due to the seasonal nature of our business, a lesser amount of impairment in future quarters could cause our leverage ratio to exceed the permitted maximum.
unearned revenues unearned revenues primarily represent our liability for gift cards that have been sold but not yet redeemed. the estimated value of gift cards expected to remain unused is recognized over the expected period of redemption as the remaining gift card values are redeemed, generally over a period of 12 years. utilizing this method, we estimate both the amount of breakage and the time period of redemption. if actual redemption patterns vary from our estimates, actual gift card breakage income may differ from the amounts recorded. we update our estimates of our redemption period and our breakage rate periodically and apply that rate to gift card redemptions on a prospective basis. changing our breakage-rate estimates by 50 basis points would have resulted in an adjustment in our breakage income of approximately $3.6 million for fiscal 2019.
income taxes we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes. these estimates include, among other items, depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes, allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported employee tip income, effective rates for state and local income taxes and the tax deductibility of certain other items. we adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available.
assessment of uncertain tax positions requires judgments relating to the amounts, timing and likelihood of resolution. as described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this report), the $27.0 million balance of unrecognized tax benefits at may 26, 2019, includes $11.6 million related to tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts could change during the next 12 months based on the outcome of examinations. the $11.6 million relates to items that would impact our effective income tax rate.
liquidity and capital resources cash flows generated from operating activities are our principal source of liquidity, which we use to finance capital expenditures for new restaurants and to remodel and maintain existing restaurants, to pay dividends to our shareholders and to repurchase shares of our common stock. since substantially all of our sales are for cash and cash equivalents, and accounts payable are generally paid in 5 to 60 days, we are able to carry current liabilities in excess of current assets. in addition to cash flows from operations, we use a combination of long-term and short-term borrowings to fund our capital needs.
we currently manage our business and financial ratios to target an investment-grade bond rating, which has historically allowed flexible access to financing at reasonable costs. our publicly issued long-term debt currently carries the following ratings:
•   moody's investors service "baa2";
•   standard &amp; poor's "bbb"; and
•   fitch "bbb".
our commercial paper has ratings of:
•   moody's investors service "p-2";
•   standard &amp; poor's "a-2"; and
•   fitch "f-2".
these ratings are as of the date of the filing of this report and have been obtained with the understanding that moody's investors service, standard & poor's and fitch will continue to monitor our credit and make future adjustments to these ratings to the extent warranted. the ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our securities, may be changed, superseded or withdrawn at any time and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
we maintain a $750.0 million revolving credit agreement (revolving credit agreement) with bank of america, n.a. (boa), as administrative agent, and the lenders and other agents party thereto. the revolving credit agreement is a senior unsecured credit commitment to the company and contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants (including limitations on liens and subsidiary debt and a maximum consolidated lease adjusted total debt to total capitalization ratio of 0.75 to 1.00) and events of default usual for credit facilities of this type. as of may 26, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants under the revolving credit agreement.
the revolving credit agreement matures on october 27, 2022, and the proceeds may be used for working capital and capital expenditures, the refinancing of certain indebtedness, certain acquisitions and general corporate purposes. loans under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at a rate of libor plus a margin determined by reference to a ratings-based pricing grid (applicable margin), or the base rate (which is defined as the highest of the boa prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.500 percent, and the eurocurrency rate plus 1.00 percent) plus the applicable margin. assuming a "bbb" equivalent credit rating level, the applicable margin under the revolving credit agreement will be 1.000 percent for libor loans and 0.000 percent for base rate loans. as of may 26, 2019, we had no outstanding balances under the revolving credit agreement.
at may 26, 2019, our long-term debt consisted principally of:
•   $500.0 million of unsecured 3.850 percent senior notes due in may 2027;
•   $96.3 million of unsecured 6.000 percent senior notes due in august 2035;
•   $42.8 million of unsecured 6.800 percent senior notes due in october 2037; and
•   $300.0 million of unsecured 4.550 percent senior notes due in february 2048.
the interest rate on our $42.8 million 6.800 percent senior notes due october 2037 is subject to adjustment from time to time if the debt rating assigned to such series of notes is downgraded below a certain rating level (or subsequently upgraded). the maximum adjustment is 2.000 percent above the initial interest rate and the interest rate cannot be reduced below the initial interest rate. as of may 26, 2019, no such adjustments are made to this rate.
through our shelf registration statement on file with the sec, depending on conditions prevailing in the public capital markets, we may issue unsecured debt securities from time to time in one or more series, which may consist of notes, debentures or other evidences of indebtedness in one or more offerings.
from time to time, we may repurchase our outstanding debt in privately negotiated transactions. such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements and other factors.
from time to time, we enter into interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk inherent in our operations. see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this report).

our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio (which includes 6.00 times the combined total annual minimum rent for operating leases and annual minimum lease payments for financing leases on a consolidated basis of $359.5 million and $342.7 million for the fiscal years ended may 26, 2019 and may 27, 2018, respectively, as components of adjusted debt and adjusted total capital) was 58 percent and 60 percent as of may 26, 2019 and may 27, 2018, respectively. we include the lease-debt equivalent and contractual lease guarantees in our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio reported to shareholders, as we believe its inclusion better represents the optimal capital structure that we target from period to period and because it is consistent with the calculation of the covenant under our revolving credit agreement.
based on these ratios, we believe our financial condition is strong. the composition of our capital structure is shown in the following table:

net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations were $1.27 billion and $1.02 billion in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. net cash flows provided by operating activities include net earnings from continuing operations of $718.6 million and $603.8 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased in fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher net earnings from continuing operations.
net cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations were $462.6 million in fiscal 2019 compared to net cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations of $451.1 million in fiscal 2018. capital expenditures incurred principally for building new restaurants, remodeling existing restaurants, replacing equipment, and technology initiatives were $452.0 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $396.0 million in fiscal 2018. for fiscal 2018, net cash used in the acquisition of 11 cheddar's scratch kitchen restaurants from an existing franchisee was $40.4 million.
net cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations were $484.2 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $636.6 million in fiscal 2018. net cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 included dividend payments of $370.8 million and share repurchases of $207.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from financing lease obligations. net cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2018 reflected long-term debt payments of $408.2 million, including repurchase premiums and make-whole provisions, repayments of short-term debt of $960.0 million, dividend payments of $313.5 million and share repurchases of $234.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of short-term debt of $960.0 million, proceeds from the issuance of $300.0 million of senior notes and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options.
our defined benefit and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are determined using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed under financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 715, compensation - retirement benefits and topic 712, compensation - nonretirement postemployment benefits. we use certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of a discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. we set the discount rate assumption annually for each plan at its valuation date to reflect the yield of high-quality fixed-income debt instruments, with lives that approximate the maturity of the plan benefits. at may 26, 2019, our discount rate was 2.66 percent and 3.95 percent, respectively, for our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon several factors, including our historical assumptions compared with actual results, an analysis of current market conditions, asset allocations and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for our defined benefit plans was 4.25 percent for fiscal year 2019 and 5.75 percent for fiscal year 2018. we expect to contribute approximately $0.4 million to our defined benefit pension plans and approximately $1.4 million to our postretirement benefit plan during fiscal 2020. in april 2018, our benefit plans committee approved the termination of our primary non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the retirement income plan for darden restaurants, inc.).  the termination of the plan involves many steps, including filing information with the irs and the pension benefit guaranty corporation and obtaining proper approvals. we anticipate the termination process, which culminates in either the settlement or transfer of participant benefits, will be completed in fiscal 2020. the plan termination is expected to result in non-cash pre-tax pension settlement expense in fiscal 2020 of approximately $130.0 million.
we have recognized net losses of $100.4 million (net of tax) and of $4.9 million (net of tax) as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the defined benefit plans and postretirement benefit plan, respectively, as of may 26, 2019. these net losses represent changes in the amount of the projected benefit obligation and plan assets resulting from differences in the assumptions used and actual experience.
we believe our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the factors discussed above. however, other assumptions could also be reasonably applied that could differ from the assumptions used. these changes in assumptions would not significantly impact our funding requirements.
we are not aware of any trends or events that would materially affect our capital requirements or liquidity. we believe that our internal cash-generating capabilities, the potential issuance of unsecured debt securities under our shelf registration statement and short-term commercial paper should be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures, debt maturities, dividend payments, stock repurchase program and other operating activities through fiscal 2020.
off-balance sheet arrangements we are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
financial condition our total current assets were $892.6 million at may 26, 2019, compared with $553.6 million at may 27, 2018. the increase was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents driven by cash from operations.
our total current liabilities were $1.47 billion at may 26, 2019, compared with $1.38 billion at may 27, 2018. the increase was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable.

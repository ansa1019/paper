item 1a. risk factors the following are important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this 10-k. we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed in other forward-looking statements, including those made in oral presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to the public.
economic recessions could have a significant, adverse impact on our business. the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession, downturns in business cycles of our customers, interest rate fluctuations, currency fluctuations, and other economic factors beyond our control. deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks, which may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our long-term growth goals:
•decrease in volumes: a reduction in overall freight volumes in the marketplace reduces our opportunities for growth. a significant portion of our freight are transactional or "spot" market opportunities. the transactional market may be more impacted than the contractual freight market by overall economic conditions. in addition, if a downturn in our customers' business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers, particularly among certain national retailers or in the food, beverage, retail, manufacturing, paper, ecommerce, or printing industries, our operating results could be adversely affected.
•credit risk and working capital: some of our customers may face economic difficulties and may not be able to pay us, and some may go out of business. in addition, some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past, causing our working capital needs to increase.
•transportation provider failures: a significant number of our contracted transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers.
•expense management: we may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to changing market demands. in order to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands. in periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs. in addition, we have other expenses that are fixed for a period of time, and we may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demand.
higher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin. carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant, or to cover higher operating expenses. our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers. increased demand for over-the-road transportation services and changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase motor carrier pricing. in some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers, in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates, we may be required to provide transportation services at a net revenue loss.
changing fuel costs and interruptions of fuel supplies may have an impact on our net revenue margins. in our truckload transportation business, which is the largest source of our net revenues, fluctuating fuel prices may result in decreased net revenue margin. while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted motor carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact, we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a pass-through cost to our truckload business. in times of fluctuating fuel prices, our net revenue margin may also fluctuate.
our dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services. we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers' freight. we depend on independent third parties to provide truck, rail, ocean, and air services and to report certain events to us, including, but not limited, to shipment status information and freight claims. these independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us, preventing us from meeting our commitments to our customers. this reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events, including recognizing claims. in addition, if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected, and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently. many of these risks are beyond our control, including:
•equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted motor carriers;
•changes in regulations impacting transportation;
•disruption in the supply or cost of fuel;
•reduction or deterioration in rail service; and
•unanticipated changes in freight markets.
we are subject to negative impacts of changes in political and governmental conditions. our operations are subject to the influences of significant political, governmental, and similar changes and our ability to respond to them, including:
•changes in political conditions and in governmental policies;
•changes in and compliance with international and domestic laws and regulations; and
•wars, civil unrest, acts of terrorism, and other conflicts.
we may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events. a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, heightened security measures, actual or threatened terrorist attack, strike, civil unrest, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical functions. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating results.
in addition, the ongoing coronavirus outbreak emanating from china at the beginning of 2020 has resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses in the region. these or any further political or governmental developments or health concerns in china or other countries in which we operate could adversely impact our operating results but at this point, the extent to which the coronavirus may impact our results is uncertain.
our international operations subject us to operational and financial risks. we provide services within and between foreign countries on an increasing basis. our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks, including:
•changes in tariffs, trade restrictions, trade agreements, and taxations;
•difficulties in managing, or overseeing foreign operations and agents;
•limitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controls;
•different liability standards; and
•intellectual property laws of countries that do not protect our rights in our intellectual property, including, but not limited to, our proprietary information systems, to the same extent as the laws of the united states.
the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region and/or decrease the profitability of our operations in that region.
as we continue to expand our business internationally, we expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls, as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. foreign currency fluctuations could result in currency exchange gains or losses or could affect the book value of our assets and liabilities. furthermore, we may experience unanticipated changes to our income tax liabilities resulting from changes in geographical income mix and changing international tax legislation. we have limited control over these risks, and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions, we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects.
our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model. our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespeople and other logistics professionals. in order to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands. in periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel. because of our comprehensive employee training program, our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors. continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers.
we face substantial industry competition. competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broad-based. we compete against traditional and non-traditional logistics companies, including transportation providers that own equipment, third party freight brokers, technology matching services, internet freight brokers, carriers offering logistics services, and on-demand transportation service providers. we also compete against carriers' internal sales forces. in addition, customers can bring in-house some of the services we provide to them. we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors. increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates, and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operations. in some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers, in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates, we may be required to provide transportation services at a net revenue loss.
we rely on technology to operate our business. we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems. our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users. we rely on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner. if we fail to maintain, protect, and enhance our operating systems, we may be at a competitive disadvantage and lose customers.
as demonstrated by recent material and high-profile data security breaches, computer malware, viruses, and computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent, have occurred on our operating systems in the past, and may occur on our operating systems in the future. previous attacks on our operating systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations, but we cannot guarantee that future attacks will have little to no impact on our business. furthermore, given the interconnected nature of the supply chain and our significant presence in the industry, we believe that we may be an attractive target for such attacks.
though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack, a significant impact on the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our operating systems and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation, impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers, and expose us to legal claims and government action, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.
our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices. we manage our business through a network of offices throughout north america, europe, asia, oceania, and south america, supported by executives and shared and centralized services, with local management responsible for day-to-day operations, personnel decisions, and adherence to applicable local laws. inconsistent management practices could materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation.
our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry. results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season. historically, income from operations and earnings are lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters. we believe this historical pattern has been the result of, or influenced by, numerous factors, including national holidays, weather patterns, consumer demand, economic conditions, and other similar and subtle forces. although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations, we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future.
we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations. we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations. from time to time, the drivers employed and engaged by the motor carriers we contract with are involved in accidents, which may result in serious personal injuries. the resulting types and/or amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted motor carrier. although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees, owner-operators, or independent contractors working for motor carriers, from time to time, claims may be asserted against us for their actions, or for our actions in retaining them. claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all. in addition, our automobile liability policy has a primary retention of $5 million per incident. a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, liability claims or workers' compensation claims, or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results. in addition, significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability. our involvement in the transportation of certain goods, including but not limited to hazardous materials, could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted motor carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination.
our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce. the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions including but not limited to flood, drought, freeze, insects, disease and other conditions over which we have no control. commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile. if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected, and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently. to assure access to certain commodities, we occasionally make monetary advances to growers to finance their operations. repayment of these advances is dependent upon the growers' ability to grow and harvest marketable crops.
buying and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability. agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals, and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination. product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination, often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce. we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale of produce, which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages. while we are insured for up to $200 million for product liability claims subject to a $500,000 per incident deductible, settlement of class action claims is often costly, and we cannot guarantee that our coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available. if we have to recall produce, we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing, transporting, and destroying any allegedly contaminated product, as well as associated consequential damages. we carry product recall insurance coverage of $50 million. this policy has a retention of $5 million per incident. any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation, particularly of our proprietary and/or licensed branded produce programs. loss due to spoilage (including the need for disposal) is also a routine part of the sourcing business.
our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations. our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal, state, and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate.
we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the dot to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle. the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity, including certain surety bonding requirements. we are also subject to regulation by the fmc as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc, and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each. we operate as a department of homeland security certified iac, providing air freight services, subject to commercial standards set forth by the iata and federal regulations issued by the tsa. we provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the u.s. customs and border protection and other authoritative governmental agencies. we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law.
we source fresh produce under a license issued by the usda as required by paca. we are also subject to various regulations and requirements promulgated by other international, domestic, state, and local agencies and port authorities. our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and the cost of providing, transportation services. as part of our logistics services, we operate owned or leased warehouse facilities. our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services, and we are subject to various federal, state, and international environmental, work safety, and hazardous materials regulations. we may experience an increase in operating costs, such as security costs, as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities. no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges, and our operations and profitability may suffer as a result.
department of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the united states and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide and/or receive services with and from these parties. enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow and/or prevent the delivery of shipments, which may negatively impact our operations.
we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business. our failure to maintain required permits or licenses, or to comply with applicable regulations, could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses.
our contracted motor carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment, including those relating to climate change, which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business. future and existing environmental regulatory requirements in the u.s. and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating expenses, which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs. if we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. even without any new legislation or regulation, increased public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away from our services.
we derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers. our top 100 customers comprise approximately 32 percent of our consolidated total revenues and 24 percent of consolidated net revenues. our largest customer comprises approximately two percent of our consolidated total revenues. the sudden loss of major customers could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments. we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses, products, services, or technologies. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates. even if we identify suitable candidates, we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. the timing and number of acquisitions we pursue may also cause volatility in our financial results. in addition, we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments. the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders.
we may have difficulties integrating acquired companies. for acquisitions, success depends upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations. these risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time. we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment, which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage. if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
our growth and profitability may not continue, which may result in a decrease in our stock price. our long-term growth objective is to grow earnings per share by 10 percent annually. long-term growth targets represent an over time perspective and do not necessarily represent an expected annual growth rate. there can be no assurance that our long-term growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management, administrative, and operational systems to respond to any future growth. future changes in and expansion of our business, or changes in economic or political conditions, could adversely affect our operating margins. slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price.
changes in the method for determining libor and the potential replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate could increase our borrowing costs. a substantial portion of our borrowing capacity bears interest at a variable rate based on libor. in july 2017, the united kingdom's financial conduct authority ("fca"), a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the united kingdom, stated that they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of libor interest rates indices. the fca has indicated they will support the libor indices through 2021, to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. the alternative reference rates committee has proposed the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") as its recommended alternative to libor, and the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing sofr rates in april 2018. sofr is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by u.s. treasury securities.
we are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate, including the possibility of sofr as the dominant replacement. introduction of an alternative rate also may introduce additional basis risk for market participants as an alternative index is utilized along with libor. there can be no guarantee that sofr will become widely used and that alternatives may or may not be developed with additional complications. we are not able to predict whether libor will cease to be available after 2021, whether sofr will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of libor, or what the impact of such a possible transition to sofr may be on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview c.h. robinson worldwide, inc. ("c.h. robinson," "the company," "we," "us," or "our") is one of the largest third party logistics companies in the world. as a third party logistics provider, we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost-effectively arrange the transport of our customers' freight. we provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes, in a wide variety of industries. we operate through a network of offices in north america, europe, asia, oceania, and south america. we have developed global transportation and distribution networks to provide transportation and supply chain services worldwide. as a result, we have the capability of facilitating most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers.
our net revenues are a non-gaap financial measure calculated as total revenues less the cost of purchased transportation and related services and the cost of purchased products sourced for resale. we believe net revenues are a useful measure of our ability to source, add value, and sell services and products that are provided by third parties, and we consider net revenues to be our primary performance measurement. accordingly, the discussion of our results of operations often focuses on the changes in our net revenues. the reconciliation of total revenues to net revenues is presented below (in thousands):

market trends the north america truckload market has faced significant cyclical changes in the last year attributable to weakening demand and excess capacity resulting in pricing and volume declines during the second half of 2019. one of the metrics we use to measure market conditions is the truckload routing guide depth from our managed services business. routing guide depth represents the number of carriers contacted prior to an acceptance when procuring a transportation provider. routing guide depth is calculated as a simple average of all accepted shipments over all tender instances for any shipment facilitated by our managed services business. the average routing guide depth of tender was 1.2 during 2019, representing that on average, the first carrier in a shipper's routing guide was executing the shipment in most cases. this compared to an average depth of tender of 1.7 during 2018. the 2019 routing guide penetration is among the lowest levels we have experienced this decade and is a reflection of both softening demand and reduced pricing and costs over the course of 2019. the global forwarding market was negatively impacted for much of 2019 by excess capacity and reduced demand due to tariff activity and macroeconomic uncertainty especially in trade lanes between china and the united states. in addition, growth rates were negatively impacted by comparisons to 2018 which included shipments to build inventory ahead of tariffs enacted in early 2019. this reduced demand has also significantly reduced air freight volumes as there is inherently less demand for expedited and more expensive air freight.
business trends our 2019 results are largely consistent with the overall market trends summarized above. as a result of the softening freight environment over the course of 2019, our volumes shifted from spot-market pricing towards contractual business. in the first half of 2019, this shift resulted in margin expansion as contractual pricing decreased at a slower rate than spot-market driven carrier costs. in the second half of 2019, the continued shift to contractual business began to lead to margin compression as spot-market driven carrier pricing declines began to decelerate as compared to our contractual pricing declines. given the soft freight environment, we continued to see competitive levels of pricing activity to reflect current market conditions which resulted in significant pricing declines in most of our transportation service lines compared to 2018. our pricing strategies continue to reflect the current market conditions and our intention to be near the top of our customers' routing guide. in addition, the reduced pricing in truckload has resulted in a volume shift from intermodal to truckload while our sourcing revenues declined in 2019 driven by case volume declines with large retailers.
on february 28, 2019, we acquired the space cargo group ("space cargo") for the purpose of expanding our presence and capabilities in spain and colombia. our consolidated results include the results of space cargo since march 1, 2019. on may 22, 2019, we acquired dema service s.p.a ("dema service") to strengthen our existing footprint in italy. our consolidated results include the results of dema service since may 23, 2019.
selected operating performance and other significant items the following summarizes select 2019 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2018:
•total revenues decreased 7.9 percent to $15.3 billion, driven by lower pricing and volumes across most transportation service lines and decreased sourcing revenue pricing and case volumes.
•net revenues decreased 4.4 percent to $2.6 billion, primarily driven by margin decline in truckload services.
•personnel expenses decreased 3.4 percent to $1.3 billion, driven primarily by declines in performance-based compensation, partially offset by a 2.3 percent increase in average headcount.
•selling, general, and administrative ("sg&a") expenses increased 10.7 percent to $497.8 million, due primarily to increases in purchased services, particularly commercial off-the-shelf software, and occupancy, partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense.
•income from operations totaled $790.0 million, down 13.4 percent due to declining net revenues and increased sg&a expense.
•operating margin of 30.5 percent decreased 320 basis points.
•diluted earnings per share (eps) decreased 11.4 percent to $4.19.
•cash flow from operations increased 5.4 percent to $835.4 million.

consolidated results of operations-twelve months ended december 31, 2019 compared to twelve months ended december 31, 2018
total revenues and direct costs. total transportation revenues decreased driven by lower pricing and volumes in truckload and, to a lesser extent, decreased intermodal volumes and decreased pricing in our ocean and air service lines. total purchased transportation and related services decreased due to decreased cost of transportation in most of our transportation services resulting from softening market demand over the course of 2019 and excess carrier capacity. our sourcing total revenues and purchased products sourced for resale decreased due to lower pricing and costs per case in addition to lower case volume.
net revenues. our transportation net revenue margin increased driven by margin expansion in truckload services as we benefited from a shift to contractual volume in a falling cost market for the first half of 2019. the margin expansion in the first half of 2019 was largely offset by margin compression in the second half of 2019 as discussed above. sourcing net revenue margin increased driven by the strategic decision to exit unprofitable business.
operating expenses. personnel expenses decreased primarily due to declines in performance-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in average headcount. other sg&a expenses increased driven primarily by increases in purchased services, particularly commercial off-the-shelf software and occupancy, partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense.
interest and other expense. interest and other expense increased driven by a $4.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses in 2019 compared to a $16.9 million favorable impact in 2018.
provision for income taxes. our effective income tax rate was 22.3 percent and 24.5 percent. the effective income tax rate for the twelve months ended december 31, 2019, was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due to state income taxes, net of federal benefit, and foreign income taxes, but was partially offset by the tax impact of excess foreign tax credits and share-based payment awards. the effective income tax rate for the twelve months ended december 31, 2018, was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due to state income taxes, net of federal benefit and foreign income taxes, but was partially offset by the tax impact of share-based payment awards.
consolidated results of operations-twelve months ended december 31, 2018 compared to twelve months ended december 31, 2017
total revenues and direct costs. total transportation revenues increased driven by increased pricing in most of our transportation services, most notably truckload and ltl. total purchased transportation and related services increased due to increased truckload and ltl purchased transportation costs and higher ocean volumes, which were partially offset by the impact of decreased truckload volumes. our sourcing total revenue and purchased products sourced for resale decreased $120.5 million as a result of our adoption of asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers.
net revenues. our transportation net revenues increased primarily due to increases in customer pricing, including fuel. sourcing net revenues decreased due to decreases in net revenue per case and a case volume decrease across a variety of commodities and services, most notably in our restaurant and food service customers. sourcing net revenue margin increased 1.0 percentage point as a result of our adoption of asu 2014-09.
operating expenses. personnel expenses increased primarily due to an increase in performance-based compensation due to our strong earnings growth and growth in our average headcount. other sg&a expenses increased driven primarily by increases in occupancy and other professional services expenses, claims and the provision for bad debt.
interest and other expense. interest and other expense decreased driven by a $16.9 million favorable impact of foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses in 2018 compared to a $9.4 million unfavorable impact in 2017. the impact of foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains was partially offset by increased interest expense due to a higher average debt balance and higher interest rates in 2018 compared to 2017.
provision for income taxes. our effective income tax rate was 24.5 percent in 2018 and 30.7 percent in 2017, driven primarily by an $83.1 million benefit from the tax act.

total revenues and direct costs. total revenues and direct costs decreased driven by reduced pricing in our ocean and air service lines and a decline in air freight volumes. these declines were driven by the tariff and macroeconomic uncertainty discussed above, in addition to the comparisons to 2018 which included shipments to build inventory ahead of tariffs enacted in early 2019. the reduced demand due to tariff and macroeconomic uncertainty has also significantly impacted air freight volumes as there is inherently less demand for expedited and more expensive air freight.
net revenues. ocean and air transportation net revenues decreased driven by reduced pricing and air freight volumes discussed above. these declines were partially offset by the acquisition of space cargo which contributed two percentage points of ocean net revenue growth and five percentage points of air net revenue growth for the twelve-month period of 2019. customs net revenues increased driven by increased volumes, including a modest impact from space cargo.
operating expenses. personnel expenses decreased driven by reduced performance-based compensation but was partially offset by an increase in average headcount driven by the space cargo acquisition. sg&a expenses increased driven by increased investments in technology, partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense.
twelve months ended december 31, 2018 compared to twelve months ended december 31, 2017
total revenues and direct costs. total revenues and direct costs increased driven by increased volumes in all services and increased customer pricing in ocean and air.
net revenues. ocean transportation net revenues increased primarily due to increases in volumes, including those from acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in net revenue margin. air transportation net revenues increased driven by increases in volumes and an increase in net revenue margin. customs net revenues increased primarily due to increased volumes including those from acquisitions. the acquisition of milgram accounted for approximately 15 percentage points of customs net revenue growth.
operating expenses. personnel expenses increased driven by an increased average headcount, primarily due to the acquisition of milgram. sg&a expenses increased driven by increased investments in technology, occupancy, and purchased services, including those from acquisitions.
all other and corporate segment results of operations all other and corporate includes our robinson fresh and managed services segment, as well as other surface transportation outside of north america and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses.

total revenues decreased primarily due to a $120.5 million decrease in sourcing total revenue and purchased products sourced for resale as a result of our adoption of asu 2014-09.
robinson fresh net revenues decreased driven by a decrease in net revenue per case and a decrease in case volumes. managed services net revenues increased primarily due to growth with existing customers. other surface transportation net revenues were essentially flat.
liquidity and capital resources we have historically generated substantial cash from operations, which has enabled us to fund our organic growth while paying cash dividends and repurchasing stock. in addition, we maintain the following debt facilities as described in note 4, financing arrangements (dollars in thousands):

we expect to use our current debt facilities and potentially other indebtedness incurred in the future to assist us in continuing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, possible acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases.
cash and cash equivalents totaled $447.9 million as of december 31, 2019, and $378.6 million as of december 31, 2018. cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states totaled $405.1 million as of december 31, 2019, and $320.0 million as of december 31, 2018. working capital decreased from $1.3 billion at december 31, 2018, to $1.1 billion at december 31, 2019.
we prioritize our investments to grow the business, as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow. we are continually looking for acquisitions, but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities. on january 28, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire prime distribution services, a leading provider of retail consolidation services in north america for approximately $225 million in cash. the agreement is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval. we anticipate financing the acquisition using cash and existing financing arrangements.

cash flow from operating activities. the increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2019 from 2018 was primarily driven by improved working capital performance and the impact of decreasing total transportation revenues and purchased transportation on our accounts receivable and accounts payable balances. the increase in cash flow from operations in 2018 from 2017 was primarily the result of increased earnings and improved working capital performance including improved collections of accounts receivable.
cash used for investing activities. our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions. capital expenditures consisted primarily of investments in information technology, which are intended to increase employee productivity, automate interactions with our customers and contracted carriers, and improve our internal workflows to help expand our operating margins and grow the business. during 2019, we sold a facility we owned in chicago, illinois for approximately $17.0 million.
in 2019, we used $45.0 million for the acquisition of space cargo and $14.2 million for the acquisition of dema service. in 2017, we used $47.3 million for the acquisition of milgram.
we anticipate capital expenditures in 2020 to be approximately $60 million to $70 million.
cash used for financing activities. we had net repayments on debt of $112.0 million in 2019, $119.0 million in 2018, and net borrowings of $225.0 million in 2017. the 2019 net repayments were primarily to reduce the outstanding amount on the receivables securitization facility while the 2018 net repayments primarily related to the revolving credit facility partially offset by long-term borrowings on the senior notes. the 2017 net borrowings were primarily related to the receivables securitization facility. there was no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2019. as of december 31, 2018, the outstanding balance on the facility was $5.0 million. as of december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with, or have secured waivers of, all of the covenants under the credit agreement, note purchase agreement, receivables securitization facility, and senior notes.
the increases in cash dividends paid were the result of higher dividend rates, partially offset by fewer outstanding shares. the increase in share repurchases in 2019 was due to an increase in the number of shares repurchased, partially offset by a decrease in the average price paid per share compared to 2018. in 2018, the increase in shares repurchased was due to an increase in the number of shares repurchased and an increase in the average price paid per share compared to 2017. in may 2018, the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased by 15,000,000 shares. as of december 31, 2019, there were 9,993,683 shares remaining for future repurchases. the number of shares we repurchase, if any, during future periods will vary based on our cash position, potential alternative uses of our cash, and market conditions.
assuming no change in our current business plan, management believes that our available cash, together with expected future cash generated from operations, the amount available under our credit facilities, and credit available in the market will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital, capital expenditures, and cash dividends for at least the next 12 months. we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice, if needed.
recently issued accounting pronouncements. refer to note 13, recently issued accounting pronouncements, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k. we consider the following items in our consolidated financial statements to require significant estimation or judgment.
revenue recognition. at contract inception, we assess the goods and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify our performance obligations to provide distinct goods and services to our customers. our transportation and logistics service arrangements often require management to use judgment and make estimates that impact the amounts and timing of revenue recognition.
transportation and logistics services - as a third party logistics provider, our primary performance obligation under our customer contracts is to utilize our relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies to efficiently and cost-effectively transport our customers' freight. revenue is recognized for these performance obligations as they are satisfied over the contract term, which generally represents the transit period. the transit period can vary based upon the method of transport, generally a number of days for over the road, rail, and air transportation, or several weeks in the case of an ocean shipment.
recognizing revenue for contracts where the transit period is partially complete or completed and not yet invoiced at period end requires management to make judgments that affect the amounts and timing of revenue recognized. at december 31, 2019 we recorded revenue of $132.9 million for services we have provided while a shipment was still in-transit but for which we had not yet completed our performance obligation or had not yet invoiced our customer. we utilize our historical knowledge of shipping lanes and estimated transit times to determine the transit period in cases where our customers' freight has not reached its intended destination. in addition, we analyze contract data for the first few days following the reporting date combined with our historical experience of trends related to partially completed contracts as of the reporting date to determine our right to consideration for the services we have provided where the transit period is partially complete or completed and not yet invoiced at period end. disruptions such as weather events or other delays could cause the actual transit period to differ from these estimates.
total revenues represent the total dollar value of revenue recognized from contracts with customers for the goods and services we provide. substantially all of our revenue is attributable to contracts with our customers. our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services, including contracted motor carrier, rail, ocean, air, and other costs, and the purchase price and services related to the products we source. most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell. in these transactions, we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service to our customer and we have discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. additionally, in our sourcing business, in some cases we take inventory risk before the specified good has been transferred to our customer. customs brokerage, managed services, freight forwarding, and sourcing managed procurement transactions are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present. see also note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, for further information regarding our revenue recognition policies.
goodwill. goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed.
goodwill is tested for impairment annually on november 30, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value ("step zero analysis"). if the step zero analysis indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value, an additional impairment assessment is performed ("step one analysis"). based on our step zero analysis, we determined that the more likely than not criteria had not been met, and therefore a step one analysis was not required.
when we perform a step one analysis, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
in the step one analysis, the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach. projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses, projected capital expenditures, changes in working capital, and the appropriate discount rate. use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publicly-traded companies that are similar in size and industry. actual results may differ from those used in our valuations when a step one analysis is performed.

________________________________
(1)amounts payable relate to the semi-annual interest due on the senior and long-term notes and the principal amount at maturity.
(2) we maintain operating leases for office space, warehouses, office equipment, and a small number of intermodal containers. see note 11, leases, for further information.
(3) purchase obligations include agreements for services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. as of december 31, 2019, such obligations primarily include ocean and air freight capacity, telecommunications services, maintenance contracts and information technology related capacity. in some instances our contractual commitments may be usage based or require estimates as to the timing of cash settlement.
we have no financing lease obligations. long-term liabilities consist primarily of noncurrent income taxes payable and long-term notes payable. due to the uncertainty with respect to the amounts or timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2019, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. therefore, $39.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. see note 5, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes. as of december 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k.

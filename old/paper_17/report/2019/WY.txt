changes in tax laws or their interpretation could adversely affect our shareholders and our results of operations.
federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the internal revenue service, the united states department of the treasury, and state taxing authorities. changes to tax laws could adversely affect our shareholders or increase our effective tax rates. we cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed.
import/export taxes and duties we may be required to pay significant taxes or tariffs on our exported products or countervailing and anti-dumping duties or tariffs on our imported products.
we export logs and finished wood products to foreign markets, and our ability to do so profitably is affected by u.s. and foreign trade policy. international trade disputes occur frequently and can be taken to an international trade court for resolution of unfair trade practices between countries.
u.s. international trade policy could result in one or more of our foreign export market jurisdictions adopting trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries. we could therefore experience reduced revenues and margins in any of our businesses that is adversely affected by international trade tariffs, duties, taxes, customs or dispute settlement terms. to the extent such trade policies increase prices, they could also reduce the demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and financial condition, including facility closures or impairments of assets. we cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any settlements of international trade disputes and their effect on our business.
our merger with plum creek timber company, inc.
we could incur substantial u.s. federal tax liability in connection with our merger with plum creek.
on february 19, 2016, plum creek timber company, inc. merged with and into weyerhaeuser company, with weyerhaeuser continuing as the surviving company. both companies have operated in a manner intended to qualify them as "reits"
for u.s. federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code. see "reit status and tax implications" above for a description of the consequences of our failure to maintain reit status. however, even if we have operated in a manner that allows us to retain our reit status, if plum creek were deemed to have lost its reit status for a taxable year before the merger or the taxable year in which the merger occurred, we could face serious tax consequences that could substantially reduce cash available for distribution to our shareholders and significantly impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital. in addition, if the merger were determined not to qualify as a tax-free merger, we could incur substantial federal tax liability that could materially and adversely affect the company's cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
risks related to our stock the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control.
the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including without limitation those described above and elsewhere in this report, as well as the following:
weyerhaeuser company > 2019 annual report and form 10-k32

•  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors' operating results;
•  announcements by us or our competitors of new products, capacity changes, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;
•  our growth rate and our competitors' growth rates;
•  general economic conditions;
•  conditions in the financial markets;
•  market interest rates and the relative yields on other financial instruments;
•  general perceptions and expectations regarding housing markets, interest rates, commodity prices, and currencies;
•  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us, our competitors or the forest products industry generally, or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock;
•  sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant shareholders;
•  sales or repurchases of substantial amounts of common stock;
•  changes in accounting principles and
•  changes in tax laws and regulations.
in addition, there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to individual company operating performance. some companies that have experienced volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them. if litigation of this type is brought against us, it could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources.
our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.
our board of directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors. these factors include, but are not limited to: our results of operations and cash flow; current and forecasted economic conditions; changes in the price and demand for our products and the general market demand for timberlands, including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses; current and forecasted harvest levels; balancing various capital allocation priorities and considerations including without limitation the company's capital requirements and debt repayment obligations;
various finance considerations, including the company's credit ratings, borrowing capacity, debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments and other related factors and tax considerations.
consequently, the amount, timing and frequency of our dividends may fluctuate.
other risks information systems and cybersecurity we rely on information technology to support our operations and reporting environments. any failure of that technology, whether by means of a security breach or other cause, could affect our ability to operate our businesses effectively, adversely affect our reported financial results, affect our reputation and expose us to potential liability or litigation.
we use information systems to carry out our operational activities, maintain our business records, and collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and other proprietary and personally identifiable information. some of our systems are internally managed and some are maintained by third-party service providers.
we employ, and we believe our third-party service providers employ, what we deem to be reasonably adequate security measures; but notwithstanding these efforts, our systems could be compromised as a result of: a cyber incident, including but not limited to the occurrence in our system of malicious code (such as malware, viruses and ransomware); a natural disaster; a hardware or software corruption, failure or error; a telecommunications system failure; a service provider failure or error; an intentional or unintentional personnel action; or any one or more other causes of system breach, failure or disruption. if by any one or more causes our systems or information resources were disrupted, shutdown or otherwise compromised, or if our data were destroyed, misappropriated or inappropriately disclosed, our financial results or our business operations, or both, could be negatively affected.
additionally, we could suffer significant losses or incur significant liabilities, including without limitation:
damage to our reputation; loss of customer confidence or goodwill and significant expenditures of time and money to address and remediate resulting damages to affected individuals or business partners or to defend ourselves in resulting litigation or other legal proceedings, by affected individuals, business partners or regulators.
pension plan liability investment returns on our pension assets may be lower than expected, or interest rates may decline, requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our benefit plans.
a portion of our current and former employees have accrued benefits under our defined benefit pension plans.
although the plans are not open to employees hired on or after january 1, 2014, current employees hired before that time continue to accrue benefits. requirements for funding our pension plan liabilities are based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including the expected rate of return on our plan assets and the discount rate applied to our pension plan obligations. fluctuations in equity market returns and changes in long-term interest rates could increase our costs under our defined benefit pension plans and may significantly affect future contribution requirements. it is unknown what the actual investment return on our pension assets will be in future years and what interest rates may be at any given point in time. we cannot therefore provide any assurance of what our actual pension plan costs will be in the future, or whether we will be required under applicable law to make future material plan contributions. see note 9: pension and other postretirement benefit plansfor additional information about these plans, including funding status.

table of contents strategic initiatives our business and financial results may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully execute on important strategic initiatives.
our strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value.
these initiatives include, among others, optimizing cash flow through operational excellence, reducing costs to achieve industry-leading cost structure and innovating in higher-margin products.there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement any one or more of our important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations, which could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
we may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy.
we intend to strategically pursue acquisitions when market conditions warrant. as with any investment, our acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations. in addition, we anticipate financing such acquisitions through cash from operations, borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities, proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from asset dispositions, or any combination thereof. our inability to finance future acquisitions on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations.

table of contents management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a)
what you will find in this md&a our md&a includes the following major sections:
•  economic and market conditions affecting our operations;
•  financial performance summary;
•  results of our operations;
•  liquidity and capital resources;
•  off-balance sheet arrangements;
•  environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies;
•  accounting matters and
•  performance measures.
for management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) related to the year ended december 31, 2017, refer to this same section (part ii, item 7) in our 2018 annual report on form 10-k as filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 15, 2019.
economic and market conditions affecting our operations the demand for grade sawlogs within our timberlands segment is directly affected by production levels of domestic wood-based building products. the strength of the u.s. housing market strongly affects demand in our wood products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. our timberlands segment, specifically the western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in japan.
the demand for pulpwood from our timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board as well as the demand for biofuels, such as pellets made from pulpwood.
housing starts for 2019 were 1.29 million total units, which was 3 percent above the 2018 total of 1.25 million units according to the u.s. census bureau. single family units totaled 888 thousand in 2019, a 1 percent improvement over the 2018 total of 876 thousand. multi-family starts were 402 thousand units for 2019, which was 7
percent higher than 2018. our outlook is for continued modest growth in u.s. housing activity. for 2020, we anticipate just over 1.3 million housing starts, with the improvement driven primarily by additional single family activity. our expectation for continued improvement in housing is based on ongoing employment growth, strong household formations, high consumer confidence and favorable mortgage rates, which have declined over 100 basis points since late 2018 and remain low on a historic basis.
according to the joint center for housing studies of harvard university, the leading indicator of remodeling activity (lira) estimates that residential remodeling expenditures increased 4.8 percent year-over-year during 2019
and will increase by 1.5 percent during 2020.
prices for lumber and oriented strand board declined sharply in late 2018 after reaching record highs in the first half of the year due to weather and transportation constraints in the supply chain. during 2019, lumber pricing improved modestly compared with year-end 2018 levels, while pricing for oriented strand board remained generally flat. according to random lengths, the framing lumber composite indicator price averaged $356/mbf in 2019, a 23
percent decrease compared with the 2018 average. the oriented strand board composite indicator price for 2019
averaged $238/msf, a 38 percent decrease from 2018.
in western log markets, douglas fir sawlog prices declined by 19 percent in 2019 compared with 2018, which was directionally consistent with western domestic lumber pricing. conversely, in the south, delivered sawlog prices increased 2 percent in 2019 compared with 2018 as rising lumber output drove incremental demand for sawlogs and wet weather in the first half of the year constrained supply.
average western export log prices declined moderately compared with 2018, falling 11 percent for china logs and 14
percent for japan grade logs. exchange rates, available supply from other countries and trade policy also affect our export businesses. the volume of logs imported to china from new zealand and europe increased in 2019 over
2018, primarily at the expense of u.s. and russian volume. a weaker yuan relative to the u.s. dollar reduces the competitiveness of u.s. logs relative to those imported from other countries whose currencies have not appreciated in a similar manner. the yuan weakened 4 percent relative to the u.s. dollar in 2019 averaging 6.91 yuan per u.s.
dollar, from 6.61 yuan per u.s. dollar in 2018.
in japan, housing starts for november 2019 year to date decreased 3.6 percent from the same period in 2018.
however, starts in the key post and beam segment declined only 1.5 percent. the decline in housing starts in 2019
is likely due to an increase in the consumption tax which became effective in october 2019. we expect demand from japan and china in 2020 will be comparable to demand experienced in 2019.

table of contents our real estate & enr segment is affected by the health of the u.s. economy and especially the u.s. housing sector.
according to the realtors land institute (rli) of the national association of realtors (nar), the dollar volume of rural properties sold increased by 2.2 percent in 2019 over 2018, and per acre prices grew 2.1 percent on average.
additionally, rli expects these trends to continue with prices and volumes of land transactions forecasted to rise
2.2 percent, withtimber expected to rise by 1.5 percent in 2020.

net sales net sales decreased $922 million - 12 percent - primarily due to:
•  a $674 million decrease in wood products net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily attributable to decreased sales realizations across the majority of our product lines, and
•  a $255 million decrease in timberlands net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily attributable to decreased log prices as well as decreased sales volumes in the west.
these decreases were slightly offset by a $7 million increase in real estate & enr net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily attributable to increased production-based royalties.
costs of sales costs of sales decreased $180 million - 3 percent - primarily due to lower per unit costs within our wood products segment, decreased sales volumes within our timberlands segment and decreased acres sold in our real estate & enr segment. refer to additional analysis of fluctuations within our wood products,timberlandsandreal estate, energy and natural resourcesdiscussions below.
operating income operating income decreased $743 million - 53 percent - primarily due to:
•  a $742 million decrease in consolidated gross margin, as described above, and
•  an $80 million impairment charge related to our montana timberlands assets (refer to note 18: charges for integration and restructuring, closures and asset impairments).
these were partially offset by a $68 million product remediation insurance recovery and a $48 million gain related to the sale of our michigan timberland assets (refer to note 19: charges (recoveries) for product remediation, netandnote 4: divestitures and assets held for sale, respectively).
net earnings net earnings decreased $824 million - 110 percent - primarily due to:
•  a $743 million decrease in operating income, as described above;
a $244 million increase in non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit costs primarily
•  attributable to a $255 million increase in pension settlement charges (refer to note 9: pension and other postretirement benefit plans) and
•  a $30 million decrease in interest income and other primarily attributable to the maturity of buyer-sponsored spe investments in 2019 (refer to note 8: related parties).
these were partially offset by a $196 million change in income taxes resulting from a $137 million income tax benefit in 2019 compared to a $59 million income tax charge in 2018 (refer toincome taxes).

the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors, including:
•  the general state of the economy,
•  demand in local real estate markets,
•  the ability to obtain entitlements,
•  the ability of buyers to obtain financing,
•  the number of competing properties listed for sale,
•  the seasonal nature of sales (particularly in the northern states),
•  the plans of adjacent landowners,
•  our expectations of future price appreciation,
•  the timing of harvesting activities and
•  the availability of government and not-for-profit funding (especially for conservation sales).
in any period, the average sales price per acre will vary based on the location and physical characteristics of parcels sold.
comparing 2019 with 2018

•  $966 million in 2019 and
•  $1,112 million in 2018.
comparing 2019 with 2018
net cash from operations decreased by $146 million, primarily due to a decrease in cash inflows from our business segments.
this decrease in net cash was partially offset by:

we expect our net capital expenditures for 2020 to be approximately $360 million. the amount we spend on capital expenditures could change due to:
•  future economic conditions,
•  environmental regulations,
•  changes in the composition of our business,
•  weather,

•  proceeds from option exercises and
•  payments for cash dividends and repurchasing stock.
consolidated net cash from financing activities was:
•  $(1,348) million in 2019 and
•  $(1,162) million in 2018.
comparing 2019 with 2018
net cash from financing activities decreased $186 million in 2019, primarily due to the following:
•  a $620 million decrease in net cash received related to borrowings on our line of credit (refer to note 11:
line of credit);
•  a $93 million increase in payments on debt held by vies (refer to note 8: related parties);
•  a $39 million decrease in cash received from exercise of stock options and
•  an $18 million increase in cash used for payments of dividends.
these were partially offset by the following:
•  a $289 million increase in net cash proceeds received related to long-term debt (refer to note 12: long-term debt) and
•  a $306 million decrease in cash used to repurchase common shares.
long-term debt our consolidated long-term debt (including current portion) was:
•  $6.1 billion as of december 31, 2019 and
•  $5.9 billion as of december 31, 2018.
the increase in our long-term debt during 2019 is attributable to the issuance of $750 million of 4.00 percent notes due in november 2029 offset by the repayment of our $500 million 7.38 percent note.
the weighted average interest rate and the weighted average maturity on our long-term debt (excluding line of credit) as of december 31, 2019 were 5.90 percent and 6.9 years, respectively.

as a basis for one of the interest rate options available to the company to apply to outstanding borrowings. libor is expected to be discontinued at some point during 2021, and we are closely monitoring ongoing market developments in the identification or creation of a widely accepted replacement rate. we have included provisions in our new revolving credit agreement that specifically contemplate the transition from libor to a replacement benchmark rate.
we have also discussed the impending discontinuation of libor with our 2017 term loan lenders, and based on those discussions, we expect to amend our term loan agreement to reflect a new reference rate to replace libor, but we do not know with any certainty when that will occur.
as of december 31, 2019, of our $6.1 billion long-term debt and $230 million line of credit borrowings, only $455
million in borrowings are governed by debt agreements that utilize libor as one of the alternative applicable rates. we therefore do not believe that the discontinuation of libor as a reference rate in our debt agreements will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or materially affect our interest expense.
our covenants our key covenants include the requirement to maintain:
•  a minimum total adjusted shareholders' equity of $3.0 billion and
•  a defined debt-to-total-capital ratio of 65 percent or less.
our total adjusted shareholders' equity is comprised of:
•  total shareholders' equity,
•  excluding accumulated comprehensive income (loss),
•  minus our investment in our unrestricted subsidiaries.
our capitalization is comprised of:
•  total debt
•  plus total adjusted shareholders' equity.
as of december 31, 2019, we had:
•  a defined total adjusted shareholders' equity of $8.7 billion and
•  a defined debt-to-total-capital ratio of 42.24 percent.
when calculating compliance in accordance with financial debt covenants as of december 31, 2019, we excluded the full amount of accumulated other comprehensive loss of $904 million. when calculating compliance in accordance with financial debt covenants as of december 31, 2018, we excluded the full amount of accumulated other comprehensive loss of $1,152 million. see note 15: shareholders' interest.
there are no other significant financial debt covenants related to our third-party debt.
credit ratings as of december 31, 2019, our long-term issuer credit rating was bbb and baa2 from s&p and moody's, respectively.
option exercises our cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were:
•  $13 million in 2019 and
•  $52 million in 2018.
our average stock price was $26.45 and $33.30 in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
dividends we paid cash dividends on common shares of:
•  $1,013 million in 2019 and
•  $995 million in 2018.
the increase in dividends paid is primarily due to an increase in our year-to-date dividends from $1.32 per share for 2018 to $1.36 per share for 2019.
share repurchases we repurchased over 2.3 million shares for approximately $60 million (including transaction fees) during the year ended december 31, 2019, under the 2019 repurchase program. we repurchased over 11.4 million shares for approximately $366 million (including transaction fees) during the year ended december 31, 2018, under the 2016
repurchase program. there were no unsettled repurchases as of december 31, 2019, or december 31, 2018. for information on share repurchases, seenote 15: shareholders' interest.

accounting matters critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements we follow established accounting policies and make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position are considered critical accounting policies.
in accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on:
•  historical experience and
•  assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.
weyerhaeuser company > 2019 annual report and form 10-k48
table of contents actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.
our most critical accounting policies relate to our:
•  pension and postretirement benefit plans;
•  potential impairments of long-lived assets and
•  legal, environmental and product liability reserves.
details about our other significant accounting policies - what we use and how we estimate - are in note 1: summary of significant accounting policies.
pension and postretirement benefit plans we sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees. key estimates we use in accounting for the plans include the:
•  fair value of our plan assets,
•  expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and
•  discount rates.
at the end of every year, we review our key estimates with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate.
we use these estimates to calculate plan asset and liability information as of year-end as well as pension and postretirement expense for the following year. actual experience that differs from our estimates or any changes in our estimates could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
fair value of plan assets plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans. the fair value of our plan assets estimates the amount that would be received if we were to sell each asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. we estimate the fair value of these assets based on the information available during the year-end reporting process. in some cases, primarily for private equity and hedge funds, the available information consists of net asset values as of an interim date, adjusted for known events occurring between the interim date and year-end.
we value the pension plan assets based on the observability of exit pricing inputs and classify them based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the pension plan assets in their entirety.
these inputs are classified within the fair value hierarchy as follows:
•  level 1: inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in an active market.
•  level 2: inputs are quoted prices in non-active markets for which pricing inputs are observable either directly or indirectly at the reporting date.
•  level 3: inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.
assets that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.
in general, we value our pension plan assets as follows:
•  cash and short-term investments are valued at cost, which approximates market;
•  fixed income and public equity investments are valued at exit prices quoted in the public market;
•  hedge funds, private equity funds and related fund units are primarily valued based on the net asset value of the funds and
•  derivative instruments are valued based upon valuation statements received from each derivative's counterparty.
assets that do not have readily available quoted prices in an active market require more judgment to value and have increased valuation risk.
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets our expected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the return that our plan assets will earn over time. this rate is important in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans.
during the years ended december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, we utilized a long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.0 percent. at the end of 2018, we began implementing a change in our asset strategy to an allocation that more closely aligns with the plan's liability profile moving forward. this results in a larger allocation of our assets into fixed income securities. with this change, we determined that it was appropriate to reduce our assumption of expected long-term rate of return on plan assets to 7.0 percent for the year ended december 31, 2019.
as this strategy has been in place throughout 2019 and a larger percentage of our portfolio has been allocated to fixed income securities, we have determined that an additional reduction in our assumption of long-term rate of return on plan assets to 6.5 percent is appropriate for the year ended december 31, 2020.
factors we considered include:
•  historical returns for a portfolio of assets similar to our expected allocation and
•  expected future performance of similar asset classes.
every 50 basis point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:
•  $14 million for our u.s. qualified pension plans and weyerhaeuser company > 2019 annual report and form 10-k49

•  $4 million for our canadian registered pension plans.
the actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected long-term rate of return. actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of total equity.
discount rates the discount rate is used to estimate the net present value of our plan obligations. our discount rates as of december 31, 2019 are:
•  3.4 percent for our u.s. pension plans - compared with 4.4 percent at december 31, 2018;
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
•  3.0 percent for our u.s. postretirement plans - compared with 4.2 percent at december 31, 2018;
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
•  3.1 percent for our canadian pension plans - compared with 3.7 percent at december 31, 2018 and
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
•  3.0 percent for our canadian postretirement plans - compared with 3.7 percent at december 31, 2018.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
the discount rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits.
pension expenses for 2020 will be based on the 3.4 percent and 3.1 percent assumed discount rates for the u.s.
pension plan and the canadian pension plan, respectively, and 3.0 percent assumed discount rate for the u.s. and canadian postretirement benefit plans.
our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans. a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:
•  $19 million for our u.s. qualified pension plans and
•  $5 million for our canadian registered pension plans.
impairment of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations. the carrying value is the original cost, less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded. refer to note 18: charges for integration and restructuring, closures and asset impairmentsfor information on an impairment recognized in 2019.
if we evaluate recoverability, we are required to estimate future cash flows and residual values of the asset or asset group. key assumptions used in developing these estimates would include probability of alternative outcomes, product pricing, raw material cost and product sales.
an impairment occurs when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is greater than the amount that could be recovered from the estimated future cash flows of the asset and greater than fair market value (the amount we could receive if we were to sell the asset). key assumptions used in developing estimates of fair value would include the estimated future cash flows used to assess recoverability, discount rates and probability of alternative outcomes.
contingent liabilities we are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as the amount or range of potential loss.
we record contingent liabilities when:
•  it becomes probable that we will have to make payments and
•  the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
assessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of loss requires analysis of multiple factors, including:
•  historical experience,
•  evaluations of relevant legal and environmental authorities and regulations,
•  judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts and
•  consideration of potential environmental remediation methods.
in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred.
recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we record additional charges. these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flows in any given quarter or year. see note
14: legal proceedings, commitments and contingenciesfor more information.

table of contents financial statements and supplementary data report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and board of directors weyerhaeuser company:
opinion on the consolidatedfinancial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of weyerhaeuser company and subsidiaries (the company)
as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years in the three‐year period ended december 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of december 31, 2019
and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three‐year period ended december 31, 2019, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2019, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission, and our report dated february 14, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting.
change in accounting principle as discussed in notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of january 1, 2019 due to the adoption of fasb asc topic 842, leases.
basis for opinion these consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matter the critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgment. the communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
evaluation of projected pension benefit obligations and associated plan assets as discussed in notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the company's projected pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the associated plan assets were $4,411 million and $3,738 million, respectively, as of december 31, 2019.
we identified the evaluation of the company's projected pension benefit obligations and associated plan assets to be a critical audit matter. this is due to the sensitivity of the obligations to changes in the discount rates used, the subjectivity in evaluating those rates, and the need to involve actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge. additionally, the assessment of the estimated fair value of plan assets, specifically hedge fund and private equity investments which are based on the net asset value ("nav"), required a higher degree of auditor judgment. the nav for these investments are obtained from the most recent unaudited capital statements prepared by fund managers and there is judgment and estimation involved in evaluating adjustments made to those capital statement values necessary for purposes of year-end reporting.
the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. we tested certain internal controls over the company's pension process, including controls related to the actuarial determination of the discount rates and the estimated fair value of hedge fund and private equity investments recorded at nav. we involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in the evaluation of the company's discount rates by understanding the methodology used by the company, assessing changes in the discount rates from the prior year against changes in published indices, and evaluating the discount rates based on the pattern of future cash flows. in regard to the fair value of plan assets recorded at nav, we evaluated the reliability of these values by assessing the company's ability to accurately estimate fair value in prior years by comparing the prior year estimated fair value (nav) to prior year audited financial statements. we also involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the company's estimated fair value (nav) for hedge fund and private equity investments by comparing the estimated returns for the period since the most recent capital statement against relevant publicly available information. additionally, we inspected trust statements for observable transactions near year-end to compare to the estimated fair value.
/s/ kpmg llp we have served as the company's auditor since 2002.

table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements note 1: summary of significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies describe:
•  our election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust,
•  how we report our results,
•  changes in how we report our results and
•  how we account for various items.
our election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (reit)
starting with our 2010 fiscal year, we elected to be taxed as a reit. reit income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax, substantially eliminating the double taxation on income. we expect to derive most of our reit income from investments in timberlands, including the sale of standing timber through pay-as-cut sales contracts and lump sum timber deeds.
we have not been subject to reit built-in gains tax since december 31, 2014. we continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our taxable reit subsidiaries (trss), which include our wood products segment and portions of our timberlands and real estate, energy and natural resources (real estate & enr) segments.
how we report our results our report includes:
•  consolidated financial statements,
•  our business segments,
•  estimates,
•  fair value measurements and
•  foreign currency translation.
consolidated financial statements our consolidated financial statements provide an overall view of our results and financial condition. they include our accounts and the accounts of entities that we control, including:
•  majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries and
•  variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary.
they do not include our intercompany transactions and accounts, which are eliminated.
throughout these notes to consolidated financial statements, unless specified otherwise, references to
"weyerhaeuser," "the company," "we" and "our" refer to the consolidated company.
our business segments reportable business segments are determined based on the company's "management approach," as defined by financial accounting standards board (fasb) accounting standards codification (asc) topic 280, segment reporting. the management approach is based on the way the chief operating decision maker organizes the segments within a company for making decisions about resources to be allocated and assessing their performance.
we are principally engaged in:
•  growing and harvesting timber;
•  manufacturing, distributing and selling products made from trees;
•  maximizing the value of every acre we own through the sale of higher and better use (hbu) properties and
•  monetizing the value of surface and subsurface assets through leases and royalties.
our business segments are organized based primarily on products and services.
segment            products and services timberlands        logs, timber, recreational leases and other products real estate & enr  real estate (sales of timberlands) and enr (rights to explore for and extract hard minerals, construction materials, oil and gas production, wind and solar)
wood products      structural lumber, oriented strand board, engineered wood products and building materials distribution we also transfer raw materials, semi-finished materials and end products among our business segments. because of this intracompany activity, accounting for our business segments involves pricing products transferred between our business segments at current market values.
unallocated items are gains or charges related to company level initiatives or previous businesses that are not allocated to our current business segments. they include all or a portion of items such as share-based compensation, pension and postretirement costs, elimination of weyerhaeuser company > 2019 annual report and form 10-k62
table of contents intersegment profit in inventory and lifo,foreign exchange transaction gains and losses,interest income and otheras well aslegacy obligations such as environmental remediation and workers compensation.
estimates we prepare our financial statements according to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap). this requires us to make estimates and assumptions during our reporting periods and at the date of our financial statements. the estimates and assumptions affect our:
•  reported amounts of assets, liabilities and equity;
•  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and
•  reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
while we do our best in preparing these estimates, actual results can and do differ from those estimates and assumptions.
fair value measurements we use a fair value hierarchy in accounting for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities including:
•  long-lived assets (asset groups) measured at fair value for an impairment assessment;
•  pension plan assets measured at fair value and
•  asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value.
the fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity's pricing based upon its own market assumptions.
the fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:
•  level 1: inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in an active market.
•  level 2: inputs are quoted prices in non-active markets for which pricing inputs are observable either directly or indirectly at the reporting date.
•  level 3: inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.
foreign currency translation we translate foreign currencies into u.s. dollars in two ways:
•  assets and liabilities - at the exchange rates in effect as of our balance sheet date and
•  revenues and expenses - at average monthly exchange rates throughout the year.
changes in how we report our results changes in how we report our results come from:
•  reclassification of certain balances and results from prior years to make them consistent with our current reporting and
•  accounting changes made upon our adoption of new accounting guidance.
reclassifications we have reclassified certain balances and results from prior years to be consistent with our 2019 reporting. this makes year-to-year comparisons easier. our reclassifications had no effect on consolidated net earnings or equity.
new accounting pronouncements lease recognition on january 1, 2019 we adopted fasb asc topic 842, leases, which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases and requires leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. we adopted using the modified retrospective transition approach at the beginning of the adoption period through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings.
with this adoption approach, financial information was not updated and disclosures required under the new standard were not provided for dates and periods before january 1, 2019. the adoption resulted in the recognition of additional right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases that each constitute less than 2 percent of total assets on our consolidated balance sheet. these leases are primarily related to vehicles, equipment, office and warehouse locations as disclosed innote 17: leases.
weyerhaeuser company > 2019 annual report and form 10-k63
table of contents benefit plans disclosure in august 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-14, which requires certain new disclosures, such as an explanation of the reasons for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation for the period, as well as removes the requirement to disclose certain previously required information. the new guidance is effective retrospectively for all periods presented for fiscal periods starting after december 15, 2020, and early adoption is permitted. we adopted this asu on december 31, 2019 and have updated our disclosures accordingly. this pronouncement does not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. refer to note 9: pension and other postretirement benefit plansfor information about our postretirement benefit plans.
how we account for various items this section provides information about how we account for certain key items related to:
•  capital investments,
•  financing our business and
•  operations.
items related to capital investments key items related to accounting for capital investments pertain to property and equipment, timber and timberlands and impairment of long-lived assets.
property and equipment we maintain property accounts on an individual asset basis and account for them as follows:
•  improvements to and replacements of major units of property are capitalized.
•  maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are expensed.
•  depreciation is calculated using a straight-line method at rates based on estimated service lives.
•  costs associated with logging roads that we intend to utilize for a period longer than one year are capitalized. these roads are then amortized over an estimated service life.
•  cost and accumulated depreciation of property sold or retired are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss is included in earnings.
timber and timberlands we carry timber and timberlands at cost less depletion. depletion refers to the carrying value of timber that is harvested, lost as a result of casualty or sold.
key activities affecting how we account for timber and timberlands include:
•  reforestation,
•  depletion and
•  forest management in canada.
reforestation.generally, we capitalize initial site preparation and planting costs as reforestation and then expense costs after the first planting as they are incurred or over the period of expected benefit. these expensed costs include:
•  fertilization,
•  vegetation and insect control,
•  pruning and precommercial thinning and
•  property taxes.
accounting practices for these costs do not change when timber becomes merchantable and harvesting starts.
timber depletion.to determine depletion rates, we divide the net carrying value of timber by the related volume of timber estimated to be available over the growth cycle. to determine the growth cycle volume of timber, we consider:
•  regulatory and environmental constraints,
•  our management strategies,
•  inventory data improvements,
•  growth rate revisions and recalibrations and
•  known dispositions and inoperable acres.
in addition, the duration of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber.
depletion rate calculations do not include estimates for:
•  future silviculture or sustainable forest management costs associated with existing stands;
•  future reforestation costs associated with a stand's final harvest and
•  future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest.
we include the cost of timber harvested in the carrying values of raw materials and product inventories. as these inventories are sold to third parties, we include them in costs of sales.

table of contents forest management in canada.we manage timberlands under long-term licenses in various canadian provinces that are:
•  granted by the provincial governments;
•  granted for initial periods of 15 to 25 years and
•  renewable provided we meet reforestation, operating and management guidelines.
calculation of the fees we pay on the timber we harvest:
•  varies from province to province,
•  is tied to product market pricing and
•  depends upon the allocation of land management responsibilities in the license.
impairment of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations. the carrying value is the original cost, less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded. impaired assets held for use are written down to fair value. impaired assets held for sale are written down to fair value less cost to sell. we determine fair value based on:
•  appraisals,
•  market pricing of comparable assets,
•  discounted value of estimated future cash flows from the asset,
•  replacement values of comparable assets and
•  agreed upon sale price or offer price.
items related to financing our business key items related to financing our business include financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and concentration of risk.
financial instruments we estimate the fair value of financial instruments where appropriate. the assumptions we use - including the discount rate and estimates of cash flows - can significantly affect our fair-value amounts. our fair values are estimates and may not match the amounts we would realize upon sale or settlement of our financial positions.
cash equivalents cash equivalents are investments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. we state cash equivalents at cost, which approximates market.
accounts payable our banking system replenishes our major bank accounts daily as checks we have issued are presented for payment. as a result, we may have negative book cash balances due to outstanding checks that have not yet been paid by the bank. these negative balances would be included in "accounts payable" on our consolidated balance sheet. changes in these negative cash balances would be reported as financing activities on ourconsolidated statement of cash flows.
we had nonegative book cash balances as of december 31, 2019 ordecember 31, 2018.
concentration of risk we disclose customers that represent a concentration of risk. as of december 31, 2019, and december 31, 2018, no customer accounted for percent or more of our net sales.
items related to operations key items related to operations include revenue recognition, inventories, shipping and handling costs, income taxes, pension and other postretirement benefit plans and environmental remediation.
revenue recognition refer to note 3: revenue recognitionfor detail on how we account for revenue.
inventories we state inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost includes labor, materials and production overhead. lifo - the last-in, first-out method - applies to major inventory products held at our u.s. domestic locations. we began to use the lifo method for domestic products in the 1940s as required to conform with the tax method elected. subsequent acquisitions of entities added new products under the fifo - the first-in, first-out method - or moving average cost methods that have continued under those methods. the fifo or moving average cost method applies to the balance of our domestic raw material and product inventories as well as for all material and supply inventories and all foreign inventories.
shipping and handling costs we classify shipping and handling costs in "costs of sales" on our consolidated statement of operations.
weyerhaeuser company > 2019 annual report and form 10-k65
table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future funding obligations to taxing authorities if uncertain tax positions we have taken on previously filed tax returns are not sustained. accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect:
•  future tax consequences due to differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of certain items and
•  net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
to measure deferred tax assets and liabilities, we:
•  determine when the differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of affected items are expected to be recovered or resolved and
•  use enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in those years.
pension and other postretirement benefit plans we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on our consolidated balance sheetand recognize changes in the funded status through comprehensive income (loss) in the year in which the changes occur.
actuarial valuations determine the amount of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost we recognize. the net periodic benefit cost includes:
•  cost of benefits provided in exchange for employees' services rendered during the year;
•  interest cost of the obligations;
•  expected long-term return on plan assets;
•  gains or losses on plan settlements and curtailments;
amortization of prior service costs and plan amendments over the average remaining service period of the
•  active employee group covered by the plans or the average remaining life expectancy in situations where the plan participants affected by the plan amendment are inactive and amortization of cumulative unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses - generally in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the benefit obligation or the combination of market-related and fair value of plan assets
•  at the beginning of the year - over the average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the plans or the average remaining life expectancy in situations where the plan participants are inactive.
pension plans. we have defined benefit pension plans covering approximately half of our employees. determination of benefits differs for salaried, hourly and union employees as follows:
•  salaried employee benefits are based on each employee's highest monthly earnings for five consecutive years during the final 10 years before retirement.
•  hourly and union employee benefits generally are stated amounts for each year of service.
•  union employee benefits are set through collective-bargaining agreements.
we contribute to our u.s. and canadian pension plans according to established funding standards. the funding standards for the plans are:
•  u.s. pension plans - according to the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and
•  canadian pension plans - according to the applicable provincial pension act and the income tax act.
postretirement benefits other than pensions. we provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for some retired employees. in some cases, we pay a portion of the cost of the benefit.note 9: pension and other postretirement benefit plansprovides additional information about our postretirement benefit plans.
environmental remediation we accrue losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value.
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when the recovery is deemed probable and does not exceed the amount of losses previously recorded.

in 2019, we changed the way we report our canadian forestlands operations. as a result, canadian
(1)  forestlands assets previously reported in the timberlands segment are now recorded in the wood products segment. we have conformed prior year presentations with the current year.
(2)  assets attributable to the real estate & enr business segment are combined with total assets for the timberlands segment as we do not produce separate balance sheets internally.
note 3: revenue recognition a majority of our revenue is derived from sales of delivered logs and manufactured wood products. we account for revenue in accordance with asc topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers, which we adopted on january 1,
2018, using the cumulative effect method. the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance did not materially affect our consolidated statement of operations,consolidated balance sheetorconsolidated statement of cash flows.
performance obligations a performance obligation, as defined in asc topic 606, is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. a contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue at the point in time, or over the period, in which the performance obligation is satisfied.
performance obligations associated with delivered log sales are typically satisfied when the logs are delivered to our customers' mills or delivered to an ocean vessel in the case of export sales. performance obligations associated with the sale of wood products are typically satisfied when the products are shipped. we have elected, as an accounting policy, to treat shipping and handling that is performed after a customer obtains control of the product as an activity required to fulfill the promise to transfer the good; therefore we will not evaluate this requirement as a separate performance obligation.
customers are generally invoiced shortly after logs are delivered or after wood products are shipped, with payment generally due within a month or less of the invoice date. asc topic 606 requires entities to consider significant financing components of contracts with customers, though allows for the use of a practical expedient when the period between satisfaction of a performance obligation and payment receipt is one year or less. given the nature of our revenue transactions, we have elected to utilize this practical expedient.
performance obligations associated with real estate sales are generally met when placed into escrow and all conditions of closing have been satisfied.
contract estimates substantially all of our performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time. therefore, there is little judgment in determining when control transfers for our business segments as described above.
the transaction price for log sales generally equals the amount billed to our customer for logs delivered during the accounting period. for the limited number of log sales subject to a long-term supply agreement, the transaction price is variable but is known at the time of billing. for wood products sales, the transaction price is generally the amount billed to the customer for the products shipped but may be reduced slightly for estimated cash discounts and rebates.
there are no significant contract estimates related to the real estate business.
contract balances in general, customers are billed and a receivable is recorded as we ship and/or deliver wood products and logs. we generally receive payment shortly after products have been received by our customers. contract asset and liability balances are immaterial.
for real estate sales, the company receives the entire consideration in cash at closing.

table of contents note 4: divestitures and assets held for sale divestitures on september 16, 2019, we announced an agreement to sell acres of michigan timberlands, which was part of our timberlands business segment. on november 13, 2019, we completed the sale to an affiliate of the lyme timber company lp for $ million of cash proceeds, which is net of purchase price adjustments and closing costs. as a result of the sale, we recorded a $ million gain in the timberlands segment.
on september 1, 2017, we completed the sale of our uruguay timberlands and manufacturing operations to a consortium led by btg pactual's timberland investment group, including other long-term investors, for $ million of cash proceeds. due to the impairment of our uruguay operations recorded during second quarter 2017 (refer to note 18:
charges for integration and restructuring, closures and asset impairments), no material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this sale.
neither of the divestitures discussed above were considered strategic shifts that had or will have a major effect on our operations or financial results and therefore did not meet the requirements for presentation as discontinued operations.
assets held for sale on december 17, 2019, we announced an agreement to sell acres of montana timberlands for $ million in cash, which is subject to customary closing conditions. this sale to southern pine plantations is expected to close in second quarter 2020, and the transaction relates to the timberlands segment.
the sale of our montana timberlands is not considered a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on our operations or financial results and therefore does not meet the requirements for presentation as discontinued operations. however, the related assets have met the relevant criteria to be classified as held for sale in the current period consolidated balance sheet. the designation as held for sale requires us to record the related net assets at the lower of their current cost basis or fair value, less an amount of estimated selling costs, and thus, we recognized a noncash pretax impairment charge of $ 80million in fourth quarter 2019 (refer to note 18: charges for integration and restructuring, closures and asset impairments). other than the impairment charge associated with held for sale classification, this classification does not affect the presentation in the consolidated statement of operations. the held for sale classification did change the presentation of the related assets from long-term to current on the consolidated balance sheet.
as of december 31, 2019, "assets held for sale" had a balance of $ million, which consisted primarily of timberlands and other related assets, after an impairment of $ million.
note 5: net earnings (loss) per share our basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the last three years were:
•  $(0.10) in 2019,
•  $0.99 in 2018 and
•  $0.77 in 2017.
how we calculate basic and diluted net earnings (loss) per share basic earnings (loss) per share is net earnings (loss) available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of our outstanding common shares, including stock equivalent units where there is no circumstance under which those shares would not be issued.
diluted earnings (loss) per share is net earnings (loss) available to common shareholders divided by the sum of the:
•  weighted average number of our outstanding common shares and
•  the effect of our outstanding dilutive potential common shares.
dilutive potential common shares may include:
•  outstanding stock options,
•  restricted stock units and
•  performance share units.

note 8: related parties this note provides details about our transactions with related parties. for the years presented, our material related parties have consisted of:
•  variable interest entities and
•  our twin creeks venture.
variable interest entities from 2002 through 2004, we sold certain nonstrategic timberlands. as a result of these sales, buyer-sponsored and monetization variable interest entities, or special purpose entities (spes), were formed. we are the primary beneficiary and consolidate the assets and liabilities of the spes involved in these transactions.
the assets of the buyer-sponsored spes are financial investments which consist of bank guarantees. these bank guarantees are in turn backed by bank notes, which are the liabilities of the monetization spes. interest earned from the financial investments within the buyer-sponsored spes is used to pay interest accrued on the corresponding monetization spe's note.
we have an equity interest in the monetization spes, but no ownership interest in the buyer-sponsored spes. the following disclosures refer to assets of buyer-sponsored spes and liabilities of monetization spes. however, because these spes are distinct legal entities:
•  assets of the spes are not available to satisfy our liabilities or obligations.
•  liabilities of the spes are not our liabilities or obligations.
during first quarter 2019, we received a $ million payment from a buyer-sponsored spe. as of december 31, 2019, we had an asset totaling $ million related to one buyer-sponsored spe remaining on our consolidated balance sheet.
this asset matured and the related payment was received in january 2020.
we paid $ million and $ million related to liabilities from our monetized spes in third quarter 2019 and fourth quarter 2018, respectively. these payments were made upon maturity and there are no further obligations remaining.
our consolidated statement of operationsincludes:
•  interest income on buyer-sponsored spe investments of:
-$ 22million in 2019,
-$ 34million in 2018 and
-$ 34million in 2017.
•  interest expense on monetization spe notes of:
-$ 12million in 2019,
-$ 29million in 2018 and
-$ 29million in 2017.
weyerhaeuser company > 2019 annual report and form 10-k72
table of contents the weighted average interest rate on our buyer-sponsored spes was percent during 2019 and 2018. the interest rate on the monetization spe that matured in 2019 and the weighted average interest rate on our monetization spes during
2018 was percent.
twin creeks venture ownership redemption, agreement termination and sale recognition during october 2017, we redeemed our percent ownership interest in the twin creeks venture for $ million in cash.
we did not recognize a material gain or loss on the redemption of our ownership interest. the cash received was classified as a cash flow from investing activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows.
effective december 31, 2017, we terminated the agreements under which we had managed the twin creeks timberlands.
following termination of these agreements, weyerhaeuser has no further responsibilities or obligations related to the twin creeks venture and our continuing involvement in the contributed timberlands ceased. in fourth quarter
2017, we recognized the sale of the original contribution of timberlands that occurred in april 2016.
sale of additional timberlands to twin creeks in conjunction with the redemption and termination discussed above, we also entered an agreement to sell acres of southern timberlands to twin creeks for $ million. the sale, which included acres of timberlands in mississippi and acres in georgia, closed december 29, 2017. the sale resulted in a $ million gain recognized during fourth quarter
2017.
note 9: pension and other postretirement benefit plans this note provides details about defined benefit and defined contribution plans we sponsor for our employees. the
"pension and other postretirement benefit plans" section of note 1: summary of significant accounting policiesprovides information about employee eligibility for pension plans and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits, as well as how we account for the plans and benefits.
defined benefit plans we sponsor overview of plans the defined benefit pension plans we sponsor in the u.s. and canada differ according to each country's requirements. in the u.s., we have plans that qualify under the internal revenue code (qualified plans), as well as plans for select employees that provide additional benefits not qualified under the internal revenue code
(nonqualified plans). in canada, we have plans that are registered under the income tax act and applicable provincial pension acts (registered plans), as well as nonregistered plans for select employees that provide additional benefits that may not be registered under the income tax act or provincial pension acts (nonregistered plans). we also offer other postretirement benefit plans in the u.s. and canada,including retiree medical and life insurance plans.
actions to reduce pension plan obligations as a part of our continued efforts to reduce pension plan obligations, we transferred approximately $ billion of u.s. qualified pension plan assets and liabilities to an insurance company through the purchase of a group annuity contract in january 2019 (2019 retiree annuity purchase). in connection with this transaction, we recorded a preliminary noncash pretax settlement charge of $ million during first quarter 2019, accelerating the recognition of previously unrecognized losses in "accumulated other comprehensive loss", that would have been recognized in subsequent periods. in second quarter 2019, we finalized the prior year-end fair value of pension plan assets and obligations, which reduced the settlement charge by $ million for a final settlement charge of $ million.
this settlement triggered a remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities. we updated the discount rate used to measure our projected benefit obligation for the u.s. qualified pension plan as of january 31, 2019, as well as our discount rate used to calculate the related net periodic benefit cost for the remainder of 2019 to percent from percent. all other assumptions remained unchanged. the net effect of the remeasurement was a $ million reduction in funded status, primarily driven by the decrease in discount rate. this change in funded status was reflected in our first quarter 2019 consolidated balance sheet.
additionally, we settled the assets and liabilities associated with three canadian registered pension plans through the purchase of a group annuity contract in october 2019. as a result of the transaction, we recorded a noncash pretax settlement charge of $ million.
during 2018, we offered select u.s. terminated vested plan participants the opportunity to elect an immediate lump sum distribution. lump sum distributions were paid from plan assets totaling $ million during fourth quarter 2018.
we recorded a settlement charge of $ million during fourth quarter 2018 related to this transaction. the settlement triggered a plan remeasurement, however due to the short period between the settlement and our normal year-end remeasurement, the effect on net periodic benefit cost was insignificant.
to maintain the u.s. qualified pension plan's funded status in connection with these transactions, we contributed $
million to the plan during third quarter 2018. refer to note 21: income taxesfor details on the tax effects of this transaction.

(estimated)
we estimate the fair value of pension plan assets based on the information available during the year-end reporting process. in some cases, primarily with regard to private equity funds, the available information consists of net asset values as of an interim date, plus cash flows and market events between the interim date and the end of the year. we update the year-end estimated fair value of pension plan assets during the first half of the next year to incorporate year-end net asset values received after we have filed our annual report on form 10-k.
during second quarter 2019, we recorded an increase in the beginning of year fair value of the pension assets of $
million, or less than percent. we also updated our census data that is used to estimate our beginning of year projected obligation for our pension plans, which resulted in a projected benefit obligation decrease of $ million, or less than percent. the net effect of these updates was a $ million improvement in funded status as of december
31, 2018. this change in funded status was reflected in our second quarter 2019 consolidated balance sheet.

pension assets our investment policies and strategies our investment policies and strategies guide and direct how the funds are managed for the benefit plans we sponsor.
these funds include our:
•  u.s. pension trust - funds our u.s. qualified pension plans;
•  canadian pension trust - funds our canadian registered pension plans and
•  retirement compensation arrangements - fund a portion of our canadian nonregistered pension plans.
u.s. and canadian pension trusts at the end of 2018, we began to shift pension plan assets to an allocation that will more closely match the pension plan liability profile going forward. the former investment strategy included investments in hedge funds, private equity funds, derivative instruments and other investments. these asset classes are now generally in redemption and run-off mode however, given the long-term nature of these investments, they will continue to comprise a material portion of the plan assets for several years. we expect all investments in redemption to be redeemed at amounts materially consistent with their net asset values. as these investments are redeemed or liquidated, cash proceeds available for investment will be invested in accordance with our revised investment strategy.
weyerhaeuser company > 2019 annual report and form 10-k75
table of contents the revised investment strategytargetsa percentageallocation to growth assets and a percentageallocation to liability hedging assetsbased on each plan's funded status. we expect to increase the allocation to liability hedging assets over time as the funded status of the pension plan improves.as of december 31, 2019, we reached a 50
percent allocation to growth assets and a 50 percent allocation to liability hedging assetsin the u.s. qualified plan.growth assets include investments in global equities, hedge funds, which are generally in redemption, and private equity assets, which are generally in run-off mode. liability hedging assets include corporate credit and government issued fixed income securitiesandtreasury futures selected to align with the plan liabilities.
cash and short-term investmentsinclude highly liquid money market and government securities and are primarily held to fund benefit payments, capital calls, margin requirements or to meet regulatory requirements. cash at december
31, 2019, includes amounts that will be invested in liability hedging assets such as fixed income investments.
fixed income investmentsinclude publicly traded corporate and government issued debt. these bonds have varying maturities, credit quality and sector exposure and are selected to align with the duration of our plan liabilities.
additionally, our fixed income portfolio includes repurchase agreements, which represent short-term borrowings to hedge against interest rate risk. we have an obligation to return the cash related to these borrowings in accordance with the agreements, which are collateralized by our government bonds. due to the nature of these agreements, the outstanding balance of the borrowing approximates fair value.
public equity investmentsconsist of investments in several publicly traded companies as well as exchange traded funds.
hedge fund and related investmentsare privately-offered managed pools primarily structured as limited liability entities. general members or partners of these limited liability entities serve as portfolio managers and are thus responsible for the fund's underlying investment decisions. underlying investments within these funds may include long and short public and private equities, corporate, mortgage and sovereign debt, options, swaps, forwards and other derivative positions. these funds have varying degrees of leverage, liquidity and redemption provisions.
private equity and related investmentsare investments in private equity, mezzanine, distressed, co-investments and other structures. private equity funds generally participate in buyouts and venture capital of limited liability entities through unlisted equity and debt instruments. these funds may also borrow at the underlying entity level.
mezzanine and distressed funds generally invest in the debt of public or private companies with additional participation through warrants or other equity options.
derivative instrumentshave historically been comprised of swaps, futures, forwards or options. consistent with our shift in asset strategy, our positions in derivative instruments have been significantly reduced. at december 31,
2019, only a small amount of futures remain in our portfolio.
assets within our qualified and registered pension plans in our u.s. and canadian pension trusts were invested as follows:

retirement compensation arrangements retirement compensation arrangements fund a portion of our canadian nonregistered pension plans. as required by canadian tax rules, approximately 50 percent of these assets are invested into a noninterest-bearing refundable tax account held by the canada revenue agency. this portion of the portfolio does not earn returns. the remaining portion is invested in a portfolio of equities.
managing risk investments and contracts are subject to risks including market price, interest rate, credit, currency and liquidity risks. the following provides an overview of these risks and describes governance processes and actions we take to mitigate these risks on our pension plan asset portfolios.
market price riskis the risk that market fluctuations will adversely affect the value of plan assets. the trusts mitigate market price risk by investing in a diversified portfolio. in addition, we and our investment advisers perform regular monitoring with ongoing qualitative assessments, quantitative assessments, and comprehensive investment and operational due diligence.
weyerhaeuser company > 2019 annual report and form 10-k76
table of contents interest rate riskexists with respect to both assets and liabilities and is the risk that a change in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of interest rate securities or liabilities, thereby affecting the overall funded status. with the change in investment strategy to more closely match the plan liabilities, interest rate risk will be reduced.
credit riskis the risk that counterparties' failure to discharge their obligations could affect cash flows. the trusts have exposure primarily through investments in fixed income securities. this risk is mitigated by investing in a diversified portfolio.
we are also exposed to credit risk indirectly through counterparty relationships initiated by underlying managers of investments in limited liability pools. this risk is mitigated through initial due diligence and ongoing monitoring processes.
currency riskarises from holding plan assets denominated in a currency other than the currency in which its liabilities are settled. with the change in investment strategy, currency risk will be mitigated going forward by investing more of the canadian plan assets in canadian dollar fixed income investments.
liquidity riskis the risk that the trust will not be able to settle liabilities such as payments to participants, counterparties, and service providers. private equity and hedge fund investments generally have less liquidity than publicly traded investments. with the change in investment strategy and a larger percentage of the plan assets invested in more liquid instruments such as publicly traded fixed income investments, liquidity risk is greatly reduced.
valuation of our plan assets pension assets are stated at fair value or net asset value (nav) as of the reporting date. fair value is based on the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to settle a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. we do not consider forced or distressed sale scenarios. instead, we consider both observable and unobservable inputs that reflect assumptions applied by market participants when setting the exit price of an asset or liability in an orderly transaction within the principal market for that asset or liability.
we value the pension plan assets based upon the observability of exit pricing inputs and classify pension plan assets based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the pension plan assets in their entirety. the fair value hierarchy is:
•  level 1: inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in an active market.
•  level 2: inputs are quoted prices in non-active markets for which pricing inputs are observable either directly or indirectly at the reporting date.
•  level 3: inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.
investments for which fair value is measured using the nav per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.
cash and short-term investments are valued at cost, which approximates market.
fixed income and public equity investments are valued at exit prices quoted in active or non-active markets or based on observable inputs.
hedge funds, private equities, and related fund units are valued based on the navs of the funds. these values represent the per-unit price at which new investors are permitted to invest and existing investors are permitted to exit. when navs as of the end of the year have not been received, we estimate fair value by adjusting the most recently reported navs for market events and cash flows between the interim date and the end of the year.
derivative instruments are valued based upon valuation statements received from each derivative's counterparty.

the availability of observable market data is monitored to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy. changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another. in such instances, the transfer is reported at the beginning of the reporting period. we evaluate the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total net assets available for benefits.

in january 2019, we transferred approximately $1.5 billion of u.s. qualified pension plan assets and liabilities to an insurance company through the purchase of a group annuity contract. the settlement of this liability triggered a plan remeasurement, which caused a change in our 2019 pension plan discount
(1)  rate. the initial discount rate used to estimate our net periodic benefit costs from january 1, 2019
through january 31, 2019 was 4.40 percent. as a result of the remeasurement, the discount rate was updated to 4.30 percent for the remainder of 2019. refer to the "actions to reduce pension plan obligations"
section above for more details of this transaction.
(2)  ppa phased table: interest and mortality assumptions as mandated by pension protection act of 2006.
(3)  u.s. qualified salaried and nonqualified plans only.
the discount rates used for our u.s. other postretirement benefit plans were percent, percent and percent for the years ended december 31, 2019, december 31, 2018, and december 31, 2017, respectively. additionally, the discount rates used for our canadian other postretirement benefit plans were percent, percent and percent for the years ended december 31, 2019, december 31, 2018, and december 31, 2017, respectively.
expected return on plan assets determining our expected return requires a high degree of judgment. we consider actual pension fund asset performance over multiple years, and current and expected valuation levels in the global equity and credit markets.
historical fund returns are used as a base and we place added weight on more recent pension plan asset performance.
qualified and registered pension plans as discussed in the "our investment policies and strategies" section above, at the end of 2018, we began implementing a change in our asset strategy to an allocation that will more closely match the plan's liability profile moving forward, resulting in a larger allocation of our assets into fixed income securities. with this change, we determined that it was appropriate to reduce our assumption of long-term rate of return on plan assets to percent for the year ended december 31, 2019. as this strategy has been in place throughout 2019 and a larger percentage of our portfolio has been allocated to fixed income securities, we have determined that an additional reduction in our assumption of long-term rate of return on plan assets to percent is appropriate for the year ended december 31, 2020.
health care costs rising costs of health care affect the costs of our other postretirement plans. we use assumptions about health care cost trend rates to estimate the cost of benefits we provide. our trend rate assumptions are based on historical market experience, current environment and future expectations. during 2019, the assumed weighted health care cost trend rate used to calculate the net periodic benefit cost was:
•  7.8 percent for u.s. pre-medicare
•  4.5 percent for u.s. health reimbursement account (hra)
•  4.9 percent for canada this table shows the assumptions we use in estimating the annual cost increase for health care benefits we provide.

expected pension plan and benefit funding established funding standards govern the funding requirements for our qualified and registered pension plans. we fund the benefit payments of our nonqualified and nonregistered plans as benefit payments come due. we voluntarily contributed $ million to our u.s. qualified pension plans during 2018, although there was no minimum required contribution for the year.
during 2019, we contributed $ million for our canadian registered plans, we made contributions and benefit payments of $ million for our canadian nonregistered pension plans and made contributions and benefit payments of $ million for our u.s. nonqualified pension plans.
during 2020, based on estimated year-end asset values and projections of plan liabilities, we expect to:
•  be required to contribute approximately $2 million for our canadian registered plan,
•  make contributions and benefit payments of approximately $17 million for our u.s. nonqualified pension plans and
•  make contributions and benefit payments of approximately $3 million for the canadian non-registered plans.
we do not anticipate contributions being required for our u.s. qualified pension plan for 2020.
expected postretirement benefit funding during 2019, we contributed $ million and $ million to our u.s. and canadian postretirement benefit plans, respectively. in 2020, we expect to make contributions of $ million for our u.s. and canadian other postretirement benefit plans, including $ million expected to be required to cover benefit payments under collectively bargained contractual obligations.

table of contents union-administered multiemployer benefit plans we contribute to multiemployer defined benefit plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements. these plans cover a small number of our employees and on an annual basis our contributions are immaterial.
these plans have different risks than single-employer plans. our contributions may be used to fund benefits for employees of other participating employers. if we choose to stop participating, we may be required to pay a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the plan. if another participating employer stops contributing to the plan, we may become responsible for remaining plan unfunded obligations.
defined contribution plans we sponsor various defined contribution plans for our u.s. and canadian salaried and hourly employees. our contributions to these plans were:
•  $25 million in 2019,
•  $22 million in 2018 and
•  $21 million in 2017.

to estimate the fair value of long-term debt we used the market approach, which is based on quoted market prices we received for the same types and issues of our debt.
we believe that our variable-rate long-term debt and line of credit instruments have net carrying values that approximate their fair values with only insignificant differences.
the inputs to these valuations are based on market data obtained from independent sources or information derived principally from observable market data. the difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at the measurement date.
fair value of other financial instruments we believe that our other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, mutual fund investments held in grantor trusts, receivables and payables, have net carrying values that approximate their fair values with only insignificant differences. this is primarily due to the short-term nature of these instruments and the allowance for doubtful accounts.
note 14: legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies this note provides details about our:
•  legal proceedings,
•  environmental matters and
•  commitments and other contingencies.
legal proceedings we are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. we are not currently a party to any legal proceeding that management believes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of operationsorconsolidated statement of cash flows.
environmental matters site remediation under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla) - commonly known as superfund - and similar state laws, we are a party to various proceedings related to the cleanup of hazardous waste sites and have been notified that we may be a potentially responsible party related to the cleanup of other hazardous waste sites for which proceedings have not yet been initiated.
we have received notification from the environmental protection agency (the epa) and have acknowledged that we are a potentially responsible party in a portion of the kalamazoo river superfund site in southwest michigan. our involvement in the remediation site is based on our former weyerhaeuser company > 2019 annual report and form 10-k85
table of contents ownership of the plainwell, michigan mill located within the remediation site. several other companies also have been deemed potentially responsible parties as past or present owners or operators of facilities within the site, or as arrangers under cercla.
we cooperated with other parties to jointly implement an administrative order issued by the epa on april 14, 2016, with respect to a portion of the site comprising a stretch of the river approximately 1.7 miles long referred to as the otsego township dam area. during third quarter 2018, implementation of this administrative order was completed.
in 2010, the company, along with others, was named as a defendant by georgia-pacific consumer products lp, fort james corporation and georgia-pacific llc in an action seeking contribution under cercla for remediation costs relating to a certain area within the site. on march 29, 2018, the u.s. district court issued an opinion and order assigning the company responsibility for 5 percent of approximately $50 million in past costs incurred by the plaintiffs. the remaining 95 percent of this pool of past costs incurred was allocated to the plaintiffs and other defendants.
the opinion and order, which is currently on appeal before the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit, does not establish allocation for future remediation costs, and accordingly, we may incur additional costs in connection with future remediation tasks for other areas of the site. in connection with the opinion and order, we updated our best estimate of the liability associated with the site and recorded a pretax charge of $28 million in first quarter 2018 within "other operating costs (income), net" on our consolidated statement of operations.
our established reserves.we have established reserves for estimated remediation costs on the active superfund sites and other sites for which we are a potentially responsible party. these reserves are recorded in "accrued liabilities" and "other liabilities" on ourconsolidated balance sheet.

reserve balance as of december 31, 2019    $  61
we change our reserve to reflect:
•  new information on any site concerning implementation of remediation alternatives,
•  updates on prior cost estimates and new sites and
•  costs incurred to remediate sites.
estimates.we believe it is reasonably possible, based on currently available information and analysis, that remediation costs for all identified sites may exceed our existing reserves by up to $ 124million.
this estimate, in which those additional costs may be incurred over several years, is the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs. the estimate:
•  is much less certain than the estimates on which our accruals currently are based and
•  uses assumptions that are less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes.
in estimating our current accruals and the possible range of additional future costs, we:
•  assumed we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of every site,
•  took into account the ability of other potentially responsible parties to participate and
•  considered each party's financial condition and probable contribution on a per-site basis.
we have not recorded any amounts for potential recoveries from insurance carriers.
asset retirement obligations we have obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets consisting primarily of reforestation obligations related to forest management licenses in canada and obligations to close and cap landfills. some of our sites have asbestos containing materials. we have met our current legal obligation to identify and manage these materials. in situations where we cannot reasonably determine when asbestos containing materials might be removed from the sites, we have not recorded an accrual because the fair value of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. as of december 31, 2019, and december 31, 2018, we had an asset retirement obligation reserve of $ million and $ million, respectively. these obligations are recorded in "accrued liabilities" and "other liabilities" on our consolidated balance sheet.

note 16: share-based compensation this note provides details about:
•  our long-term incentive compensation plan (2013 plan),
•  how we account for share-based awards,
•  tax benefits of share-based awards,
•  types of share-based compensation,
•  unrecognized share-based compensation and
•  deferred compensation stock equivalent units.
weyerhaeuser company > 2019 annual report and form 10-k88
table of contents share-based compensation expense was:
•  $30 million in 2019,
•  $42 million in 2018 and
•  $40 million in 2017.
our long-term incentive compensation plan our long-term incentive plan provides for share-based awards that include:
•  restricted stock,
•  restricted stock units (rsus),
•  performance shares,
•  performance share units (psus),
•  stock options and
•  stock appreciation rights (sars).
we may issue future grants of up to million shares under the 2013 plan. we also have the right to reissue forfeited and expired grants.
for restricted stock, rsus, performance shares, psus or other equity grants:
•  an individual participant may receive a grant of up to 1 million shares annually.
•  no participant may be granted awards that exceed $10 million earned in a 12-month period.
for stock options and sars:
•  an individual participant may receive a grant of up to 2 million shares in any one calendar year.
•  the exercise price is required to be the market price on the date of the grant.
we have not granted any stock options or sars since 2016 and the remaining liability related to sars is immaterial at december 31, 2019.
the compensation committee of our board of directors annually establishes an overall pool of stock awards available for grants based on performance.
for stock-settled awards we:
•  issue new stock into the marketplace and
•  generally do not repurchase shares in connection with issuing new awards.
our common shares would increase by approximately million shares if all share-based awards were exercised or vested. these include:
•  all options, rsus and psus outstanding at december 31, 2019, and
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
•  all remaining options, rsus and psus that could be granted under the 2013 plan.
how we account for share-based awards when accounting for share-based awards we:
•  use a fair-value-based measurement and
•  recognize the cost of share-based awards on our consolidated financial statements.
we recognize the cost of share-based awards on our consolidated statement of operationsover the required service period - generally the period from the date of the grant to the date when it is fully vested. special situations include:
•  awards that vest upon retirement - the required service period ends on the date an employee is eligible for retirement, including early retirement.
•  awards that continue to vest following job elimination or the sale of a business - the required service period ends on the date the employment from the company is terminated.
in these special situations, compensation expense from share-based awards is recognized over a period that is shorter than the stated vesting period.
tax benefits of share-based awards our total income tax benefit from share-based awards recognized on our consolidated statement of operationsfor the last three years was:
•  $4 million in 2019,
•  $5 million in 2018 and
•  $6 million in 2017.
weyerhaeuser company > 2019 annual report and form 10-k89
table of contents tax benefits from share-based awards are accrued as stock compensation expense and realized when:
•  restricted shares and rsus vest,
•  performance shares and psus vest,
•  stock options are exercised and
•  sars are exercised.
types of share-based compensation our share-based compensation is in the form of:
•  rsus,
•  psus,
•  stock options and
•  sars.
restricted stock units through the 2013 plan, we award rsus - grants that entitle the holder to shares of our stock as the award vests.
the details our rsus granted in 2019, 2018 and 2017 generally:
•  vest ratably over four years;
•  immediately vest in the event of death while employed or disability;
•  continue to vest upon retirement at an age of at least 62, but a portion of the grant is forfeited if retirement occurs before the one-year anniversary of the grant;
•  continue vesting for one year in the event of involuntary termination when retirement has not been met and
•  will be forfeited upon termination of employment in all other situations including early retirement prior to age 62.
our accounting the fair value of our rsus is the market price of our stock on the grant date of the awards.
we generally record share-based compensation expense for rsus over the four-year vesting period. generally, for rsus that continue to vest following the termination of employment, we record the share-based compensation expense over a required service period that is less than the stated vesting period.

(1)  as of december 31, 2019, there were approximately 526 thousand rsus that had met the requisite service period and will be released as identified in the grant terms.
the weighted average grant-date fair value for rsus was:
•  $25.83 in 2019,
•  $34.19 in 2018 and
•  $32.83 in 2017.
the total grant-date fair value of rsus vested was:
•  $18 million in 2019,
•  $16 million in 2018 and
•  $18 million in 2017.
nonvested rsus accrue dividends that are paid out when rsus vest. any rsus forfeited will not receive dividends.
as rsus vest, a portion of the shares awarded is withheld to cover employee taxes. as a result, the number of stock units vested and the number of common shares issued will differ.
weyerhaeuser company > 2019 annual report and form 10-k90
table of contents performance share units through the 2013 plan, we award psus - grants that entitle the holder to shares of our stock as the award vests.
the details the final number of shares awarded will range from percent to percent of each grant's target, depending upon actual company performance.
for psus granted in 2019, 2018 and 2017, the ultimate number of shares earned is based on two measures:
our relative total shareholder return (tsr) ranking measured against the s&p 500 over a three-year period
•  and
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
•  our relative tsr ranking measured against an industry peer group of companies over a three-year period.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
the vesting provisions for psus granted in 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:
•  vest 100 percent on the third anniversary of the grant date as long as the individual remains employed by the company;
•  fully vest in the event the participant dies or becomes disabled while employed;
•  continue to vest upon retirement at an age of at least 62, but a portion of the grant is forfeited if retirement occurs before the one-year anniversary of the grant;
•  continue vesting for one year in the event of involuntary termination when the retirement criteria has not been met and the employee has met the second anniversary of the grant date and
•  will be forfeited upon termination of employment in all other situations including early retirement prior to age 62.
our accounting since the awards contain a market condition, the effect of the market condition is reflected in the grant-date fair value which is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model. this model estimates the tsr ranking of the company over the performance period. compensation expense is based on the estimated probable number of earned awards and recognized over the vesting period on an accelerated basis. generally, compensation expense would be reversed if the performance condition is not met unless the requisite service period has been achieved.

note 17: leases we account for leases in accordance with asc topic 842, leases, which we adopted on january 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition approach at the beginning of the adoption period through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. this adoption resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets ("rou assets") of
$ million and lease liabilities of $ million, with the difference of $ million recorded to "retained earnings", on our consolidated balance sheeton january 1, 2019.
the majority of our operating leases are related to our office and warehouse space, and the majority of our financing leases are related to vehicles and forklifts. our leases have remaining lease terms of approximately year to years. options to renew, extend or terminate a lease are reflected in our lease terms when we believe it is reasonably certain we will exercise that option. when our leases do not provide an implicit or an explicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments.

in december 2017, h.r. 1 (the tax act) was enacted. the tax act contained significant changes to corporate
(2)  taxation, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. as a result of this change, we revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities and recorded tax expense of $74 million during 2017, which reduced our net deferred tax asset.
at the end of 2017, we revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the 21 percent federal tax rate prescribed by the tax act. during 2018, we made a voluntary contribution of $300 million to our u.s.
(3)  qualified pension plan. we deducted this contribution on our 2017 u.s. federal tax return at the 2017
federal tax rate of 35 percent. this resulted in an incremental $41 million tax benefit for the portion attributable to our trss. refer to note 9: pension and other postretirement benefit plans for further information on the voluntary contribution.

table of contents reinvestment of undistributed earnings starting in 2018, we revised our indefinite reinvestment assertion regarding the earnings of our canadian subsidiary to permanently reinvest approximately percent of its earnings. our change in assertion was based on the company's review of global cash management and planned capital deployment, taking into consideration the effects of the tax act. we have no other foreign subsidiaries with undistributed earnings. accordingly, deferred taxes have been provided primarily related to canadian withholding taxes associated with canadian earnings no longer considered permanently reinvested.
unrecognized tax benefits unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future obligations to taxing authorities if uncertain tax positions we have taken on previously filed tax returns are not sustained. in accordance with our accounting policy, we accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense (see note
1: summary of significant accounting policies).the total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december
31, 2019 and 2018, as well as the activity during those years, were immaterial.
as of december 31, 2019, our 2016 and 2017 u.s. federal income tax returns are under examination. no foreign jurisdiction income tax returns are under examination. our u.s. federal income tax returns are open to examination for years 2016 forward and foreign jurisdiction income tax returns are open to examination for years 2012 forward.
we are undergoing examinations in state jurisdictions for tax years 2009 through 2017, with tax years 2009 forward open to examination. we do not expect that the outcome of any examination will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements; however, audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty.
resolution of irs matter in connection with the merger with plum creek, we acquired equity interests in southern diversified timber, llc
(sdt), a timberland joint venture (timberland venture) with an affiliate of campbell global llc (tcg member). on august 31, 2016, the timberland venture redeemed tcg member's interest and became a fully consolidated, wholly-
owned subsidiary of weyerhaeuser.
we received a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment (fpaa) dated july 20, 2016, from the internal revenue service (irs) in regard to plum creek's 2008 u.s. federal income tax treatment of the transaction forming the timberland venture. the irs asserted that the transfer of the timberlands to the timberland venture was a taxable transaction to plum creek at the time of the transfer rather than a nontaxable capital contribution. we subsequently filed a petition in the u.s. tax court to contest this adjustment.
on february 8, 2019, we entered into a closing agreement with the irs to settle this dispute. under the terms of the agreement, the company paid approximately $ million of corporate tax. this amount was recorded as tax expense in fourth quarter 2018. no interest or penalties were assessed. the parties filed a stipulated decision with the u.s. tax court, pursuant to which the court officially closed the matter.

because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) related to the year ended december 31, 2017, refer to this same section (part ii, item 7) in our 2018 annual report on form 10-k as filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 15, 2019.
economic and market conditions affecting our operations the demand for grade sawlogs within our timberlands segment is directly affected by production levels of domestic wood-based building products. the strength of the u.s. housing market strongly affects demand in our wood products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. our timberlands segment, specifically the western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in japan.
the demand for pulpwood from our timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board as well as the demand for biofuels, such as pellets made from pulpwood.
housing starts for 2019 were 1.29 million total units, which was 3 percent above the 2018 total of 1.25 million units according to the u.s. census bureau. single family units totaled 888 thousand in 2019, a 1 percent improvement over the 2018 total of 876 thousand. multi-family starts were 402 thousand units for 2019, which was 7
percent higher than 2018. our outlook is for continued modest growth in u.s. housing activity. for 2020, we anticipate just over 1.3 million housing starts, with the improvement driven primarily by additional single family activity. our expectation for continued improvement in housing is based on ongoing employment growth, strong household formations, high consumer confidence and favorable mortgage rates, which have declined over 100 basis points since late 2018 and remain low on a historic basis.
according to the joint center for housing studies of harvard university, the leading indicator of remodeling activity (lira) estimates that residential remodeling expenditures increased 4.8 percent year-over-year during 2019
and will increase by 1.5 percent during 2020.
prices for lumber and oriented strand board declined sharply in late 2018 after reaching record highs in the first half of the year due to weather and transportation constraints in the supply chain. during 2019, lumber pricing improved modestly compared with year-end 2018 levels, while pricing for oriented strand board remained generally flat. according to random lengths, the framing lumber composite indicator price averaged $356/mbf in 2019, a 23
percent decrease compared with the 2018 average. the oriented strand board composite indicator price for 2019
averaged $238/msf, a 38 percent decrease from 2018.
in western log markets, douglas fir sawlog prices declined by 19 percent in 2019 compared with 2018, which was directionally consistent with western domestic lumber pricing. conversely, in the south, delivered sawlog prices increased 2 percent in 2019 compared with 2018 as rising lumber output drove incremental demand for sawlogs and wet weather in the first half of the year constrained supply.
average western export log prices declined moderately compared with 2018, falling 11 percent for china logs and 14
percent for japan grade logs. exchange rates, available supply from other countries and trade policy also affect our export businesses. the volume of logs imported to china from new zealand and europe increased in 2019 over
2018, primarily at the expense of u.s. and russian volume. a weaker yuan relative to the u.s. dollar reduces the competitiveness of u.s. logs relative to those imported from other countries whose currencies have not appreciated in a similar manner. the yuan weakened 4 percent relative to the u.s. dollar in 2019 averaging 6.91 yuan per u.s.
dollar, from 6.61 yuan per u.s. dollar in 2018.
in japan, housing starts for november 2019 year to date decreased 3.6 percent from the same period in 2018.
however, starts in the key post and beam segment declined only 1.5 percent. the decline in housing starts in 2019
is likely due to an increase in the consumption tax which became effective in october 2019. we expect demand from japan and china in 2020 will be comparable to demand experienced in 2019.

table of contents our real estate & enr segment is affected by the health of the u.s. economy and especially the u.s. housing sector.
according to the realtors land institute (rli) of the national association of realtors (nar), the dollar volume of rural properties sold increased by 2.2 percent in 2019 over 2018, and per acre prices grew 2.1 percent on average.
additionally, rli expects these trends to continue with prices and volumes of land transactions forecasted to rise
2.2 percent, withtimber expected to rise by 1.5 percent in 2020.

share comparing 2019 with 2018
net sales net sales decreased $922 million - 12 percent - primarily due to:
•  a $674 million decrease in wood products net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily attributable to decreased sales realizations across the majority of our product lines, and
•  a $255 million decrease in timberlands net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily attributable to decreased log prices as well as decreased sales volumes in the west.
these decreases were slightly offset by a $7 million increase in real estate & enr net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily attributable to increased production-based royalties.
costs of sales costs of sales decreased $180 million - 3 percent - primarily due to lower per unit costs within our wood products segment, decreased sales volumes within our timberlands segment and decreased acres sold in our real estate & enr segment. refer to additional analysis of fluctuations within our wood products,timberlandsandreal estate, energy and natural resourcesdiscussions below.
operating income operating income decreased $743 million - 53 percent - primarily due to:
•  a $742 million decrease in consolidated gross margin, as described above, and
•  an $80 million impairment charge related to our montana timberlands assets (refer to note 18: charges for integration and restructuring, closures and asset impairments).
these were partially offset by a $68 million product remediation insurance recovery and a $48 million gain related to the sale of our michigan timberland assets (refer to note 19: charges (recoveries) for product remediation, netandnote 4: divestitures and assets held for sale, respectively).
net earnings net earnings decreased $824 million - 110 percent - primarily due to:
•  a $743 million decrease in operating income, as described above;
a $244 million increase in non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit costs primarily
•  attributable to a $255 million increase in pension settlement charges (refer to note 9: pension and other postretirement benefit plans) and
•  a $30 million decrease in interest income and other primarily attributable to the maturity of buyer-sponsored spe investments in 2019 (refer to note 8: related parties).
these were partially offset by a $196 million change in income taxes resulting from a $137 million income tax benefit in 2019 compared to a $59 million income tax charge in 2018 (refer toincome taxes).

the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors, including:
•  the general state of the economy,
•  demand in local real estate markets,
•  the ability to obtain entitlements,
•  the ability of buyers to obtain financing,
•  the number of competing properties listed for sale,
•  the seasonal nature of sales (particularly in the northern states),
•  the plans of adjacent landowners,
•  our expectations of future price appreciation,
•  the timing of harvesting activities and
•  the availability of government and not-for-profit funding (especially for conservation sales).
in any period, the average sales price per acre will vary based on the location and physical characteristics of parcels sold.
comparing 2019 with 2018

•  $(137) million in 2019 and
•  $59 million in 2018.
during 2019, we recorded a $109 million tax benefit related to the noncash pretax settlement charge recorded in connection with our u.s. pension plan and a $17 million tax expense related to an insurance recovery received in connection with prior product remediation efforts.
during 2018, we recorded a $41 million tax benefit related to contributions made to our pension plan and deducted on our 2017 u.s. federal tax return and a $21 million charge related to a tax settlement.

•  $966 million in 2019 and
•  $1,112 million in 2018.
comparing 2019 with 2018
net cash from operations decreased by $146 million, primarily due to a decrease in cash inflows from our business segments.
this decrease in net cash was partially offset by:
a $336 million decrease in pension and postretirement contributions and benefit payments, which is primarily
•  related to the $300 million voluntary contribution to our u.s. qualified pension plan in 2018 (refer to note
9: pension and other postretirement benefit plans for further information) and
•  a $97 million decrease in cash paid for taxes.
pension contributions and benefit payments made and expected during 2019, we contributed a total of $45 million to our pension and postretirement plans. during 2018, we contributed a total of $381 million to our pension and postretirement plans, including a voluntary contribution of
$300 million to our u.s. qualified plan.

•  $(1,162) million in 2018.
comparing 2019 with 2018
net cash from financing activities decreased $186 million in 2019, primarily due to the following:
•  a $620 million decrease in net cash received related to borrowings on our line of credit (refer to note 11:
line of credit);
•  a $93 million increase in payments on debt held by vies (refer to note 8: related parties);
•  a $39 million decrease in cash received from exercise of stock options and
•  an $18 million increase in cash used for payments of dividends.
these were partially offset by the following:
•  a $289 million increase in net cash proceeds received related to long-term debt (refer to note 12: long-term debt) and
•  a $306 million decrease in cash used to repurchase common shares.

•  $6.1 billion as of december 31, 2019 and
•  $5.9 billion as of december 31, 2018.
the increase in our long-term debt during 2019 is attributable to the issuance of $750 million of 4.00 percent notes due in november 2029 offset by the repayment of our $500 million 7.38 percent note.
the weighted average interest rate and the weighted average maturity on our long-term debt (excluding line of credit) as of december 31, 2019 were 5.90 percent and 6.9 years, respectively.
see note 12: long-term debtfor more information about the long-term debt discussed above.
line of credit in march 2017, we entered into a $1.5 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in march 2022. as of december 31, 2019, we had $230 million of outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility and had an additional $1,270 million available. as of december 31, 2018, we had $425 million of outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility. we were in compliance with the revolving credit facility covenants as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018.

table of contents injanuary 2020,we amendedand restatedour $1.5 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which now expires in january 2025.
our revolving credit agreement and our 2017 term loan agreement utilize the london inter-bank offered rate (libor)
as a basis for one of the interest rate options available to the company to apply to outstanding borrowings. libor is expected to be discontinued at some point during 2021, and we are closely monitoring ongoing market developments in the identification or creation of a widely accepted replacement rate. we have included provisions in our new revolving credit agreement that specifically contemplate the transition from libor to a replacement benchmark rate.
we have also discussed the impending discontinuation of libor with our 2017 term loan lenders, and based on those discussions, we expect to amend our term loan agreement to reflect a new reference rate to replace libor, but we do not know with any certainty when that will occur.
as of december 31, 2019, of our $6.1 billion long-term debt and $230 million line of credit borrowings, only $455
million in borrowings are governed by debt agreements that utilize libor as one of the alternative applicable rates. we therefore do not believe that the discontinuation of libor as a reference rate in our debt agreements will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or materially affect our interest expense.
our covenants our key covenants include the requirement to maintain:
•  a minimum total adjusted shareholders' equity of $3.0 billion and
•  a defined debt-to-total-capital ratio of 65 percent or less.
our total adjusted shareholders' equity is comprised of:
•  total shareholders' equity,
•  excluding accumulated comprehensive income (loss),
•  minus our investment in our unrestricted subsidiaries.
our capitalization is comprised of:
•  total debt
•  plus total adjusted shareholders' equity.
as of december 31, 2019, we had:
•  a defined total adjusted shareholders' equity of $8.7 billion and
•  a defined debt-to-total-capital ratio of 42.24 percent.
when calculating compliance in accordance with financial debt covenants as of december 31, 2019, we excluded the full amount of accumulated other comprehensive loss of $904 million. when calculating compliance in accordance with financial debt covenants as of december 31, 2018, we excluded the full amount of accumulated other comprehensive loss of $1,152 million. see note 15: shareholders' interest.
there are no other significant financial debt covenants related to our third-party debt.
credit ratings as of december 31, 2019, our long-term issuer credit rating was bbb and baa2 from s&p and moody's, respectively.
option exercises our cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were:
•  $13 million in 2019 and
•  $52 million in 2018.
our average stock price was $26.45 and $33.30 in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
dividends we paid cash dividends on common shares of:
•  $1,013 million in 2019 and
•  $995 million in 2018.
the increase in dividends paid is primarily due to an increase in our year-to-date dividends from $1.32 per share for 2018 to $1.36 per share for 2019.
share repurchases we repurchased over 2.3 million shares for approximately $60 million (including transaction fees) during the year ended december 31, 2019, under the 2019 repurchase program. we repurchased over 11.4 million shares for approximately $366 million (including transaction fees) during the year ended december 31, 2018, under the 2016
repurchase program. there were no unsettled repurchases as of december 31, 2019, or december 31, 2018. for information on share repurchases, seenote 15: shareholders' interest.

accounting matters critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements we follow established accounting policies and make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position are considered critical accounting policies.
in accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on:
•  historical experience and
•  assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.
weyerhaeuser company > 2019 annual report and form 10-k48
table of contents actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.
our most critical accounting policies relate to our:
•  pension and postretirement benefit plans;
•  potential impairments of long-lived assets and
•  legal, environmental and product liability reserves.
details about our other significant accounting policies - what we use and how we estimate - are in note 1: summary of significant accounting policies.
pension and postretirement benefit plans we sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees. key estimates we use in accounting for the plans include the:
•  fair value of our plan assets,
•  expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and
•  discount rates.
at the end of every year, we review our key estimates with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate.
we use these estimates to calculate plan asset and liability information as of year-end as well as pension and postretirement expense for the following year. actual experience that differs from our estimates or any changes in our estimates could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
fair value of plan assets plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans. the fair value of our plan assets estimates the amount that would be received if we were to sell each asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. we estimate the fair value of these assets based on the information available during the year-end reporting process. in some cases, primarily for private equity and hedge funds, the available information consists of net asset values as of an interim date, adjusted for known events occurring between the interim date and year-end.
we value the pension plan assets based on the observability of exit pricing inputs and classify them based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the pension plan assets in their entirety.
these inputs are classified within the fair value hierarchy as follows:
•  level 1: inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in an active market.
•  level 2: inputs are quoted prices in non-active markets for which pricing inputs are observable either directly or indirectly at the reporting date.
•  level 3: inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.
assets that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.
in general, we value our pension plan assets as follows:
•  cash and short-term investments are valued at cost, which approximates market;
•  fixed income and public equity investments are valued at exit prices quoted in the public market;
•  hedge funds, private equity funds and related fund units are primarily valued based on the net asset value of the funds and
•  derivative instruments are valued based upon valuation statements received from each derivative's counterparty.
assets that do not have readily available quoted prices in an active market require more judgment to value and have increased valuation risk.
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets our expected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the return that our plan assets will earn over time. this rate is important in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans.
during the years ended december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, we utilized a long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.0 percent. at the end of 2018, we began implementing a change in our asset strategy to an allocation that more closely aligns with the plan's liability profile moving forward. this results in a larger allocation of our assets into fixed income securities. with this change, we determined that it was appropriate to reduce our assumption of expected long-term rate of return on plan assets to 7.0 percent for the year ended december 31, 2019.
as this strategy has been in place throughout 2019 and a larger percentage of our portfolio has been allocated to fixed income securities, we have determined that an additional reduction in our assumption of long-term rate of return on plan assets to 6.5 percent is appropriate for the year ended december 31, 2020.
factors we considered include:
•  historical returns for a portfolio of assets similar to our expected allocation and
•  expected future performance of similar asset classes.
every 50 basis point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:
•  $14 million for our u.s. qualified pension plans and weyerhaeuser company > 2019 annual report and form 10-k49

•  $4 million for our canadian registered pension plans.
the actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected long-term rate of return. actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of total equity.
discount rates the discount rate is used to estimate the net present value of our plan obligations. our discount rates as of december 31, 2019 are:
•  3.4 percent for our u.s. pension plans - compared with 4.4 percent at december 31, 2018;
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
•  3.0 percent for our u.s. postretirement plans - compared with 4.2 percent at december 31, 2018;
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
•  3.1 percent for our canadian pension plans - compared with 3.7 percent at december 31, 2018 and
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
•  3.0 percent for our canadian postretirement plans - compared with 3.7 percent at december 31, 2018.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
the discount rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits.
pension expenses for 2020 will be based on the 3.4 percent and 3.1 percent assumed discount rates for the u.s.
pension plan and the canadian pension plan, respectively, and 3.0 percent assumed discount rate for the u.s. and canadian postretirement benefit plans.
our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans. a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:
•  $19 million for our u.s. qualified pension plans and
•  $5 million for our canadian registered pension plans.
impairment of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations. the carrying value is the original cost, less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded. refer to note 18: charges for integration and restructuring, closures and asset impairmentsfor information on an impairment recognized in 2019.
if we evaluate recoverability, we are required to estimate future cash flows and residual values of the asset or asset group. key assumptions used in developing these estimates would include probability of alternative outcomes, product pricing, raw material cost and product sales.
an impairment occurs when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is greater than the amount that could be recovered from the estimated future cash flows of the asset and greater than fair market value (the amount we could receive if we were to sell the asset). key assumptions used in developing estimates of fair value would include the estimated future cash flows used to assess recoverability, discount rates and probability of alternative outcomes.
contingent liabilities we are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as the amount or range of potential loss.
we record contingent liabilities when:
•  it becomes probable that we will have to make payments and
•  the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
assessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of loss requires analysis of multiple factors, including:
•  historical experience,
•  evaluations of relevant legal and environmental authorities and regulations,
•  judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts and
•  consideration of potential environmental remediation methods.
in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred.
recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we record additional charges. these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flows in any given quarter or year. see note
14: legal proceedings, commitments and contingenciesfor more information.

we also reconcile net earnings before special items to net earnings and net earnings per diluted share before special items to net earnings per diluted share, as those are the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures. we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information for investors about our operating performance, better facilitate period to period comparisons, and are widely used by analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties.

item 1a. risk factors in evaluating nvidia and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10-k. before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part of your investment. additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.
risks related to our business, industry and partners if we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or identify new products, services or technologies, our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted.
we created gpu-based visual and accelerated computing platforms that address four large markets: gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. these markets often experience rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry changes and to develop new (or enhance our existing) products, services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. such activities may require considerable technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments. we devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, such as the automotive and data center markets, which presents additional risks to our business. we must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to scale our business in these areas, including customer service and support. we also must meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change. additionally, we continue to make considerable investments in research and development, which may not produce significant revenue for several years, if at all. if our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products, services and technologies, or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers, partners and ultimately, our shareholders. if we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, our business will be harmed.
competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.
our target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve, customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets. our competitors' products, services and technologies may be less costly, or may offer superior functionality or better features, than ours, which may result, among other things, in lower than expected selling prices for our products. in addition, some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive intellectual property, or ip, portfolios and patent protections, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. these competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, quickly transition their products, including semiconductor products, to increasingly smaller line width geometries, and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business. if we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets, respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment, including in significant international markets such as china, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer. in addition, the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.
system security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.
security breaches, computer malware, phishing, and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years. these threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures. these attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future. experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third parties. these attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. these hackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products, including consumer and automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality over time. for portions of our it infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. these providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems. data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee with access to our systems. to defend against security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which may result in increased expenses.
actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability, paying damages, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business. our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful. we may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions. delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.
we depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business.
we do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our gpus and tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co. ltd., to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. similarly, we do not directly assemble, test or package our products, but instead rely on independent subcontractors. we do not have long-term commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors. as a result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:
•   a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraints;
•   a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or test capacity for our products;
•   a failure to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis;
•   a limited number of suppliers, including foundries, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers;
•   loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier;
•   a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and
•   delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors' orders over our orders or otherwise.
in addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, increase manufacturing costs, harm customer or partner relationships, and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the foundry. low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure. we do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry. as a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem.
we also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner. in the past, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. if we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline. if we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business will be harmed.
for our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor. achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand. failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. this could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes.
unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers. further, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards, including safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies. winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated, if any.
if our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share.
our products are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. these risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, including into the automotive market, or as new versions are released. some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product. undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers, the end product in which our device has been integrated by oems, odms, aibs and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, write off the value of related inventory, cause us to lose market share, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. in addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins, harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers' perceptions of our brand. also, we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the field. a product recall, including automotive recalls or a recall due to a bug in our products, or a significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract new customers, result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us, such as product liability suits. if a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.
business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.
our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, outages at cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change. the occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in california, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. in addition, a large portion of our current data center capacity is located in california, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. the manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including taiwan, china, hong kong, and korea. additionally, a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through hong kong. geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the united states or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. in particular, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans. for example, regulations to implement the export control reform act of 2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans. catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for it and research and development systems and personnel. our operations could be harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. the ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. in the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.
in january 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus was identified in china, resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing and commerce, as well as global travel restrictions to contain the virus. the impact has extended to other regions. we have operations and employees in china, and the region represents an important end market for our products. our customers and suppliers within china and neighboring countries are also affected by the coronavirus related restrictions and closures. the coronavirus is expected to have a negative effect on our financial results, though the full extent and duration is uncertain and could have a material negative impact on our business.
if we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed.
we manufacture our gpus and tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand and requirements. we sell many of our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. as a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results. in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up demand. such decisions may and have resulted in prolonged channel sell-through, as we experienced with our mid-range gaming gpus in fiscal year 2019. in estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include:
•   changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy;
•   changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market;
•   a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products;
•   a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
•   our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products;
•   less demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or
•   increased competition, including competitive pricing actions.
the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our gross margins. in addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals. we could be required to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or market or write-off excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results.
conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers' orders on a timely basis. we may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. in such cases, even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. if we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.
we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.
we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. with several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels. for fiscal year 2020, 11% of our total revenue was from one customer, dell. our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our gpus and tegra processors. in the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products than they did in the past, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way, particularly because:
•   most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty;
•   our partners may develop their own solutions;
•   our customers may purchase products from our competitors; or
•   our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products.
we could also be restricted from selling our products or providing our technology and services due to u.s. trade restrictions. the loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, or our inability to sell to a customer due to u.s. trade restrictions would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations, and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition.
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers. in the future, we may have to record additional provisions or write-offs and/or defer revenue on certain sales transactions, which could negatively impact our financial results, and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient.
we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, which may harm our business.
we conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the united states. our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states. we also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the united states. we allocate revenue to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers' revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. revenue from sales outside of the united states accounted for 92% of total revenue for fiscal year 2020, and 87% for each of fiscal years 2019 and 2018. revenue from billings to china, including hong kong, was 25% of our revenue for fiscal year 2020, even if our customers' revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. additionally, as of january 26, 2020, approximately 46% of our employees were located outside of the united states. the global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:
•   international economic and political conditions, including as a result of the united kingdom's vote to withdraw from the european union, and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;
•   unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;
•   differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;
•   local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations;
•   exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, including deemed export restrictions, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions;
•   disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations; and
•   increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits.
if our sales outside of the united states are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may be negatively impacted.
if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively.
to be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. in particular, hiring qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business. additionally, changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. additionally, competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. the interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.
we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments, including the mellanox acquisition, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.
we have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products, strategic objectives and business. in march 2019, we announced our agreement to acquire mellanox for approximately $6.9 billion. the mellanox acquisition and other past or future acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks, and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results. given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. additional risks related to the mellanox acquisition, and other acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:
•   difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business;
•   diversion of capital and other resources, including management's attention;
•   assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;
•   integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
•   coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated;
•   difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if at all;
•   difficulty in obtaining regulatory, other approvals or financing;
•   failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment;
•   legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;
•   uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;
•   negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;
•   the need to later divest acquired assets if an acquisition does not meet our expectations;
•   potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company; and
•   impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target's, employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment.
risks related to regulatory, legal, our common stock and other matters actions to adequately protect our ip rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.
we have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief. claims that our products or processes infringe the ip rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.
we may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights. such proceedings may increase our operating expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. further, we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation. if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party's patent or intellectual property, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party's patent or other intellectual property rights. however, we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. we may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.
our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property. to accomplish this, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally. we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business. the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states. this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. in addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies, but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections.
our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.
our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors. therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance.
factors, other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our results of operations in the future include, but are not limited to:
•   our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products;
•   our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;
•   fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies;
•   changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners' products;
•   our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing;
•   our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers' contractual obligations;
•   product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues;
•   our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards;
•   supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products
•   inventory write-downs;
•   our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our partner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems, and our partner network's ability to sell products that incorporate our gpus and tegra processors;
•   the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers;
•   customer bad debt write-offs;
•   any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities;
•   unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property;
•   changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and
•   general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets.
any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results. any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.
privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using our products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.
our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. the theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs, damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legal claims.
worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection, which continue to evolve and apply to our business. for example, the european union adopted the general data protection regulation, or gdpr, which requires companies to meet new requirements effective as of may 2018 regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. in addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united states, europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. if so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. complying with these changing laws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. further, failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.
we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates.
as a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions. our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. further, changes in united states federal, and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act, or tcja.
our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or statutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in the united states compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in our international organization, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.
our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.
we currently and may in the future face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business on a global basis. for example, multiple securities litigation claims have recently been filed against us and certain of our officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on gpu demand. in addition, a stockholder, purporting to act on behalf of the company, filed a derivative lawsuit seeking to assert claims on behalf of the company against the members of our board of directors and certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on gpu demand.
litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. an unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. in addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.
in addition, the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently. we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy violations of, these laws and regulations.
delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft corporation could delay or prevent a change in control.
our status as a delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. in addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. these provisions include the following:
•   the ability of our board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval;
•   the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;
•   advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals;
•   the ability of our board of directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval;
•   a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;
•   the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and
•   the ability of our board of directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.
on march 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox. under the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with "item 1a. risk factors", "item 6. selected financial data", our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.
overview our company and our businesses nvidia pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. starting with a focus on pc graphics, we extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of ai. fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3d graphics and the scale of the gaming market, nvidia leveraged its gpu architecture to create platforms for vr, hpc, and ai.

revenue for fiscal year 2020 was $10.92 billion, down 7% from a year earlier. gpu business revenue was $9.47 billion, down 7% from a year earlier. tegra processor business revenue - which includes automotive, socs for gaming platforms, and embedded edge ai platforms - was $1.45 billion, down 6% from a year earlier.
from a market platform perspective, gaming revenue was $5.52 billion, down 12% from a year ago, reflecting lower sales of geforce desktop gpus and socs for gaming platforms, partially offset by growth in geforce notebook gpus.
professional visualization revenue was $1.21 billion, up 7% from a year ago, reflecting strength in desktop and notebook workstations.
data center revenue was $2.98 billion, up 2% from a year ago, driven by vertical industry growth partially offset by lower hyperscale sales.
automotive revenue was $700 million, up 9% from a year ago, reflecting growth in ai cockpit solutions and development services agreements.
oem and other revenue was $505 million, down 34% from a year ago, primarily due to the absence of cryptocurrency-specific product sales.
gross margin for fiscal year 2020 was 62.0%, up 80 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components.
operating expenses for fiscal year 2020 were $3.92 billion, up 16% from a year ago, reflecting primarily employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including stock-based compensation and infrastructure costs.
income from operations for fiscal year 2020 was $2.85 billion, down 25% from a year earlier. net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2020 were $2.80 billion and $4.52, respectively, both down 32% from a year earlier reflecting lower revenue and higher operating expenses.
on march 10, 2019, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger, or the merger agreement, with mellanox technologies ltd., or mellanox, pursuant to which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of mellanox for $125 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion as of the date of the merger agreement. the merger agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. the consummation of the merger is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of mellanox shareholders, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the merger agreement. in june 2019, mellanox shareholders approved the consummation of the merger and we received regulatory approvals for the deal from mexico in july 2019 and from the european commission in december 2019. in addition, the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, in connection with the proposed acquisition expired in may 2019. discussions with china's regulatory agency, the state administration for market regulation, are progressing and we believe the acquisition will likely close in the early part of calendar 2020. if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals, we could be obligated to pay mellanox a termination fee of $350 million.
in november 2018, we communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. in fiscal year 2020, we returned $390 million in quarterly cash dividends. we did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2020. we intend to return to repurchasing shares after closing the acquisition of mellanox.
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $10.90 billion as of january 26, 2020, compared with $7.42 billion as of january 27, 2019. the increase primarily reflects growth in operating cash flow.
in january 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus was identified in china, resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing and commerce, as well as global travel restrictions to contain the virus. the impact has extended to other regions. we have operations and employees in china, and the region represents an important end market for our products. our customers and suppliers within china and neighboring countries are also affected by the coronavirus related restrictions and closures. the coronavirus is expected to have a negative effect on our financial results, though the full extent and duration is uncertain and could have a material negative impact on our business.
gpu business in gaming, we extended nvidia's family of turing-based gpus with the geforce gtx 1660 ti, gtx 1660 and gtx 1650, as well as with our new super line, including the geforce rtx 2080 super, rtx 2070 super, rtx 2060 super, gtx 1660 super, and gtx 1650 super; and accelerated momentum of ray-tracing games by supporting a growing list of titles; introduced new rtx studio laptops powered by geforce rtx and quadro rtx gpus for online and studio-based creatives and prosumer customers; unveiled two new models of the shield tv streaming media player; and introduced two new service offerings for geforce now cloud gaming service.
in professional visualization, we expanded adoption of nvidia rtx ray-tracing technology by 3d application providers; rolled out a full range of turing-based quadro gpus for mobile workstations, incorporating ray tracing for product design, architecture, effects and scientific visualization; and unveiled the nvidia omniverse open-collaboration platform to simplify creative workflows for content creation.
in data center, we introduced the nvidia cuda-x ai platform for accelerating data science; announced availability of nvidia t4 tensor core gpus from leading oems and cloud service providers; unveiled the dgx superpod; and announced support for arm cpus, providing a new path to build ai-enabled exascale supercomputers, as well as a collaboration with arm and others on a reference design for gpu accelerated arm-based servers. we launched the nvidia egx intelligent edge computing platform, bringing accelerated ai to vertical industries; and announced a collaboration to integrate microsoft azure with egx, as well as plans for a scalable gpu-accelerated supercomputer in the microsoft azure cloud. additionally, we entered the 5g telecom market, enabling telcos to build efficient, virtualized 5g rans; announced a collaboration to deliver software-defined 5g ran; and announced that alibaba and baidu's recommendation engines run on nvidia ai.
tegra processor business in our automotive platform, we announced a partnership with toyota research institute-advanced development to develop, train and validate self-driving vehicles; unveiled the nvidia drive ap2x automated driving solution, encompassing drive autopilot software, drive agx and drive validation tools; introduced the nvidia drive av safety force field to enable safe, comfortable driving experiences; and announced availability of the nvidia drive constellation autonomous vehicle simulation platform.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, or u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventories, revenue recognition, income taxes, and goodwill. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10-k.
inventories inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. we charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition. in addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.
the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019. the charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during fiscal year 2019 were primarily related to excess dram, other components, and prior architecture components and chips. as a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. in doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. we also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.
refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this management's discussion and analysis for further discussion.
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. we determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
product sales revenue revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.
for products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. however, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.
our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or mdfs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners' activities while also promoting nvidia products. we account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and mdfs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.
license and development arrangements our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. as a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. if a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.
refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
income taxes we recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. we recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.
our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. in addition, we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.
as of january 26, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $621 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.
we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
refer to note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
goodwill goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. we have identified two reporting units, gpu and tegra processor, for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis. goodwill assigned to the gpu and tegra processor reporting units as of january 26, 2020 was $210 million and $408 million, respectively. determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.
we performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 using a qualitative assessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment.
refer to note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.

gpu business. gpu business revenue decreased by 7% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, which reflects a decline in gpus sold for gaming. geforce gpu product sales for gaming decreased by 10%, reflecting lower sales of geforce desktop gpus and socs for gaming platforms, partially offset by growth in geforce notebook gpus. revenue from quadro gpus for professional visualization increased by 7%, reflecting strength in desktop and notebook workstations. data center revenue, which includes tesla, grid and dgx, increased by 2%, driven by vertical industry growth partially offset by lower hyperscale sales.
tegra processor business.  tegra processor business revenue decreased by 6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019. this was driven by a decline in revenue from socs for gaming platforms, which was partially offset by an increase of 9% in automotive revenue, reflecting growth in ai cockpit solutions and development services agreements.
concentration of revenue revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for 92% and 87% of total revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.
dell represented approximately 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 and was attributable to the gpu business. no customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2019.
gross profit and gross margin gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs. cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.
our overall gross margin was 62.0% and 61.2% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. the increase in fiscal year 2020 was driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components.
inventory provisions totaled $161 million and $270 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $145 million and $41 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. as a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019.
a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows:
gpu business. the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components.
tegra processor business. the gross margin of our tegra processor business was relatively flat during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019.

sales, general and administrative sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 10% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense.
total other income, net interest income and interest expense interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. interest income was $178 million and $136 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. the increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances.
interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% notes due 2021 and 3.20% notes due 2026 issued in september 2016. interest expense was $52 million and $58 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.
other, net other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. other, net, was not significant during fiscal year 2020 and was $14 million of income during fiscal year 2019, consisting primarily of $12 million unrealized gains from non-affiliated investments.
income taxes we recognized income tax expense of $174 million for fiscal year 2020 and income tax benefit of $245 million for fiscal year 2019. our annual effective tax rate was 5.9% and (6.3)% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. the increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation and an absence of tax benefits related to the enactment of the tcja.
our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the british virgin islands and hong kong, where the tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of u.s. federal research tax credits, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the tcja in 2019.

as of january 26, 2020, we had $10.90 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $3.48 billion from the end of fiscal year 2019. our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain limits on our portfolio duration.
cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to changes in working capital driven by a reduction in inventory, partially offset by a decrease in operating income.
cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to lower purchases, higher sales, and lower maturities of marketable securities in preparation for the acquisition of mellanox.
cash used in financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to no share repurchases in fiscal year 2020 and lower tax payments related to employee stock plans.

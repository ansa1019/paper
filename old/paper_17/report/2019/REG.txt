item 1a. risk factors risk factors related to the retail industry economic and market conditions may adversely affect the retail industry and consequently reduce our revenues and cash flow, and increase our operating expenses.
our properties are leased primarily to retail tenants from whom we derive most of our revenue in the form of base rent, expense recoveries and other income. therefore, our performance and operating results are directly linked to the economic and market conditions occurring in the retail industry. we are subject to the risks that, upon expiration, leases for space in our properties are not renewed by existing tenants, vacant space is not leased to new tenants, or tenants demand new lease terms, including costs for renovations or concessions. the market for leasing retail space in our properties may be adversely affected by any of the following:
•   changes in national, regional and local economic conditions;

•   changes in population and migration patterns to/from the markets in which we operate;

•   deterioration in the competitiveness and creditworthiness of our retail tenants;

•   increased competition from the use of e-commerce by retailers and consumers as well as other concepts such as super-stores and warehouse clubs;

•   tenant bankruptcies and subsequent rejections of our leases;

•   reductions in consumer spending and retail sales;

•   reduced tenant demand for retail space;

•   oversupply of retail space;

•   reduced consumer demand for certain retail categories;

•   consolidation within the retail sector;

•   increased operating costs;

•   perceptions by retailers and shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our properties; and

•   acts of terrorism and war, natural disasters and other physical and weather-related damages to our properties.

to the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact the retail industry, our retail tenants, the demand and market rents for retail space, the occupancy levels of our properties, our ability to sell, acquire or develop properties, our operating results and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders.
shifts in retail sales and delivery methods between brick and mortar stores, e-commerce, home delivery, and curbside pick-up may adversely impact our revenues and cash flows.
retailers are increasingly impacted by e-commerce and changes in customer buying habits, including the delivery or curbside pick-up of items ordered online. retailers are considering these e-commerce trends when making decisions regarding their bricks and mortar stores and how they will compete and innovate in a rapidly changing retail environment. many retailers in our shopping centers provide services or sell goods, which have historically been less likely to be purchased online; however, the continuing increase in e-commerce sales in all retail categories may cause retailers to adjust the size or number of retail locations in the future or close stores. our grocer tenants are incorporating e-commerce concepts through home delivery and curbside pick-up, which could reduce foot traffic at our centers. in certain higher-income markets, foot traffic at our centers may be impacted more by these alternative delivery methods if consumers are willing to pay premiums for such services.  this shift may adversely impact our occupancy and rental rates, which would impact our revenues and cash flows. changes in shopping trends as a result of the growth in e-commerce may also impact the profitability of retailers that do not adapt to changes in market conditions. these conditions may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows if we are unable to meet the needs of our tenants or if our tenants encounter financial difficulties as a result of changing market conditions.
6
changing economic and retail market conditions in geographic areas where our properties are concentrated may reduce our revenues and cash flow.
economic conditions in markets where our properties are concentrated can greatly influence our financial performance. during the year ended december 31, 2019, our properties in california, florida, texas, new york and virginia accounted for 29.0%, 21.0%, 6.9%, 5.7%, and 5.0% respectively, of our noi from consolidated properties plus our pro-rata share from unconsolidated properties ("pro-rata basis"). our revenues and cash flow may be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions, such as supply of or demand for retail space, deteriorate more significantly in these states compared to other geographic areas.
our success depends on the success and continued presence of our "anchor" tenants.
"anchor tenants" (tenants occupying 10,000 square feet or more) occupy large stores in our shopping centers, pay a significant portion of the total rent at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by attracting shoppers to the property. we derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as publix, kroger co., albertsons companies, inc., tjx companies, inc., and whole foods who accounted for 3.2%, 3.0%, 2.8%, 2.4%, and 2.4%, respectively, of our total annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis, for the year ended december 31, 2019. additionally, other tenants with significant lease obligations at a singular location could also have a material impact on our earnings if they are unable to fulfill their lease obligations or fail to renew their leases.  our net income and cash flow may be adversely affected by the loss of revenues and additional costs in the event a significant anchor tenant:
•   becomes bankrupt or insolvent;

•   experiences a downturn in its business;

•   materially defaults on its leases;

•   does not renew its leases as they expire;

•   renews at lower rental rates and/or requires a tenant improvement allowance; or

•   renews but reduces its store size, which results in down-time and additional tenant improvement costs to the landlord to re-lease the vacated space.

some anchors have the right to vacate their space and may prevent us from re-tenanting by continuing to comply and pay rent in accordance with their lease agreement. vacated anchor space, including space owned by the anchor, can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center in other spaces because of the loss of the departed anchor's customer drawing power. if a significant tenant vacates a property, co-tenancy clauses in select lease contracts may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations. co-tenancy clauses have several variants: they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores; they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration; or more commonly, they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center.
additionally, many of our shopping centers are anchored by retailers who own their space whose location is within or immediately adjacent to our shopping center ("shadow anchors").  in those cases, the shadow anchors appear to the consumer as a retail tenant of the shopping center and, as a result, attract additional consumer traffic to the center. in the event that a shadow anchor were to close, it could negatively impact our center as consumer traffic would likely be reduced.
a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller "shop space" tenants and our net income may be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful.
"shop space tenants" (tenants occupying less than 10,000 square feet) may be more vulnerable to negative economic conditions as they have more limited resources than anchor tenants. shop space tenants may be facing reduced sales as a result of an increase in competition including from e-commerce retailers. the types of shop space tenants vary from retail shops and restaurants to service providers. if we are unable to attract the right type or mix of shop space tenants into our centers, our revenues and cash flow may be adversely impacted.
at december 31, 2019, shop space tenants represent approximately 36.0% of our gla leased at average base rents of $34.86 per square foot ("psf"). a one-percent decline in our shop space occupancy may result in a reduction to base rent of approximately $5.0 million.
we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy.
although lease income (including base rent and recoveries from tenants) are supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file for bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. any unsecured claim we hold against a
7
bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims.  as a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold.  additionally, we may incur significant expense to recover our claim and to re-lease the vacated space. in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files for bankruptcy and rejects its leases, we may experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all pre-petition amounts owed by the bankrupt tenant.
risk factors related to real estate investments and operations we are subject to numerous laws and regulations that may adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability.
our properties are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations, some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to varying judicial or regulatory interpretations. these laws and regulations may include zoning laws, building codes, competition laws, rules and agreements, landlord-tenant laws, property tax regulations or changes in real estate assessments, including changes in laws related thereto, and other laws and regulations generally applicable to business operations. noncompliance with such laws and regulations, and any associated litigation may expose us to liability.
our real estate assets may decline in value and be subject to impairment losses which may reduce our net income.
our real estate properties are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. we evaluate whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, such that the value of the real estate properties (including any related tangible or intangible assets or liabilities, including goodwill) may not be recoverable. through the evaluation, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated holding periods, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate. these key assumptions are subjective in nature and may differ materially from actual results. changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the holding period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss may be material to the company's financial condition or operating performance. to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.
the fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through the use of comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach. such cash flow projections take into account expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other relevant criteria, and therefore are subject to management judgment. changes in these factors may impact the determination of fair value. in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.
these subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income, which may be material. there can be no assurance that we will not record impairment charges in the future related to our assets.
we face risks associated with development, redevelopment and expansion of properties.
we actively pursue opportunities for new retail development, or existing property redevelopment or expansion. development and redevelopment activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay this process. we may not recover our investment in development or redevelopment projects for which approvals are not received. we are subject to other risks associated with these activities, including the following risks:
•   we may be unable to lease developments or redevelopments to full occupancy on a timely basis;

•   the occupancy rates and rents of a completed project may not be sufficient to make the project profitable;

•   actual costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project unprofitable;

•   delays in the development or construction process may increase our costs;

•   construction cost increases may reduce investment returns on development and redevelopment opportunities;

•   we may abandon development or redevelopment opportunities and lose our investment due to adverse market conditions;

8
•   the size of our development and redevelopment pipeline may strain our labor or capital capacity to complete the development and redevelopment projects within targeted timelines and may reduce our investment returns;

•   a reduction in the demand for new retail space may reduce our future development and redevelopment activities, which in turn may reduce our net operating income; and

•   changes in the level of future development and redevelopment activity may adversely impact our results from operations by reducing the amount of internal overhead costs that may be capitalized.

we face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties.
we are expanding our investment focus to include more complex acquisitions and mixed-use development and redevelopment projects in very dense urban locations, which pose unique risks to our return on investment.  mixed-use projects refer to real estate projects that, in addition to retail space, may also include space for residential, office, hotel or other commercial purposes.  we have less experience in developing and managing non-retail real estate than we do retail real estate.  as a result, if a development or redevelopment project includes a non-retail use, we may seek to develop that component ourselves, sell the rights to that component to a third-party developer, or partner with a developer.
•   if we decide to develop the non-retail components ourselves, we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate, but also to risks associated with developing, owning, operating or selling non-retail real estate, including but not limited to more complex entitlement processes and multiple-story buildings. these unique risks may adversely impact our return on investment in these mixed-use development projects.

•   if we sell the non-retail components, our retail component will be impacted by the decisions made by the other owners, and actions of those occupying the non-retail spaces in these mixed-use properties.

•   if we partner with a developer, it makes us dependent upon the partner's ability to perform and to agree on major decisions that impact our investment returns of the project. in addition, there is a risk that the non-retail developer may default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other components ourselves, including providing necessary financing.

in addition, redevelopment of existing shopping centers into mixed-use projects generally includes tenant vacancies before and during the redevelopment, which could result in volatility in noi.
we face risks associated with the acquisition of properties.
our investment strategy includes investing in high-quality shopping centers that are leased to market-dominant grocers, category-leading anchors, specialty retailers, or restaurants located in areas with high barriers to entry and above average household incomes and population densities. the acquisition of properties and/or real estate entities entails risks that include, but are not limited to, the following, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows:
•   properties we acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project, within the time frames we estimate, which may result in the properties' failure to achieve the investment returns we project;

•   our investigation of an entity, property or building prior to our acquisition, and any representation we may have received from such seller, may fail to reveal various liabilities including defects, necessary repairs or environmental matters requiring corrective action, which may increase our costs;

•   our estimate of the costs to improve, reposition or redevelop a property may prove to be too low, or the time we estimate to complete the improvement, repositioning or redevelopment may be too short, either of which may result in the property failing to achieve our projected return, either temporarily or permanently;

•   we may not recover our costs from an unsuccessful acquisition;

•   our acquisition activities may distract or strain our management capacity; and

•   we may not be able to successfully integrate an acquisition into our existing operations platform.

we face risks if we expand into new markets.
if opportunities arise, we may acquire or develop properties in markets where we currently have no presence. each of the risks applicable to acquiring or developing properties in our current markets are applicable to acquiring, developing and integrating properties in new markets. in addition, we may not possess the same level of familiarity with the dynamics and conditions of the new markets we may enter, which may adversely affect our operating results and investment returns in those markets.
9
we may be unable to sell properties when desired because of market conditions.
our properties, including their related tangible and intangible assets, represent the majority of our total consolidated assets and they may not be readily convertible to cash. as a result, our ability to sell one or more of our properties, including properties held in joint ventures, in response to changes in economic, industry, or other conditions may be limited. the real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability and terms of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand for space, that are beyond our control. there may be less demand for lower quality properties that we have identified for ultimate disposition in markets with uncertain economic or retail environments, and where buyers are more reliant on the availability of third party mortgage financing. if we want to sell a property, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or even exceed the carrying value of our investment. moreover, if a property is mortgaged, we may not be able to obtain a release of the lien on that property without the payment of a substantial prepayment penalty, which may restrict our ability to dispose of the property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable.
certain properties we own have a low tax basis, which may result in a taxable gain on sale. we intend to utilize 1031 exchanges to mitigate taxable income; however, there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions. in the event that we do not utilize 1031 exchanges, we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax, which may reduce our cash flow available to fund our commitments.
certain of the properties in our portfolio are subject to ground leases; if we are unable to renew a ground lease, purchase the fee simple interest, or are found to be in breach of a ground lease, we may be adversely affected.
we have 28 properties in our portfolio that are either partially or completely on land subject to ground leases with third parties. accordingly, we only own a long-term leasehold or similar interest in those properties. if we are unable to purchase a fee interest in the underlying land or extend the terms of these leases before or upon their expiration, as to which no assurance can be given, we will lose our interest in the improvements and the right to operate such properties.  in addition, if we are found to be in breach of a ground lease, we may lose our interest in the improvements and the right to operate the property that is subject to the ground lease.  the existing lease terms, including renewal options, were taken into consideration when making our investment decisions. the purchase price and subsequent improvements are being depreciated over the shorter of the remaining life of the ground leases or the useful life of the underlying assets. if we were to lose the right to operate a property due to not exercising renewal options of the ground lease or a breach, we would be unable to derive income from such property, which would impair the value of our investments, and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
climate change may adversely impact our properties directly and may lead to additional compliance obligations and costs as well as additional taxes and fees.
to the extent climate change causes adverse changes in weather patterns, our properties in certain markets may experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea‐levels. climate change may result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or, in extreme cases, our inability to operate certain properties at all. climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of insurance, or making insurance unavailable. moreover, compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change, including compliance with "green" building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or pay additional taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties.  although we strive to identify, analyze, and respond to the risk and opportunities that climate change presents, at this time, there can be no assurance that climate change will not have an adverse effect on us.
geographic concentration of our properties makes our business more vulnerable to natural disasters, severe weather conditions and climate change.
a significant number of our properties are located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes, tropical storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, sea-level rise, and other natural disasters. at december 31, 2019, 28% of the total insured value of our portfolio is located in the state of california, including a number of properties in the san francisco bay and los angeles areas. additionally, 18% and 7% of the total insured value of our portfolio is located in the states of florida and texas, respectively. recent intense weather conditions may cause property insurance premiums to increase significantly in the future. we recognize that the frequency and / or intensity of extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and other climatic changes may continue to increase, and as a result, our exposure to these events may increase. these weather conditions may disrupt our business and the business of our tenants, which may affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of tenants or residents to remain in or move to these affected areas. therefore, as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties, we face risks, including disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants and higher costs, such as uninsured property losses, higher insurance premiums, and potential additional regulatory requirements by government agencies in response to perceived risks.
an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties may subject us to loss of capital and revenue on those properties.
we carry comprehensive liability, fire, flood, terrorism, business interruption, and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. some types of losses, such as losses from named windstorms, earthquakes, terrorism, or wars may have limited coverage or be excluded from insurance coverage. although we carry
10
specific insurance coverage for named windstorm and earthquake losses, the policies are subject to deductibles up to 2% to 5% of the total insured value of each property, up to a $10 million maximum deductible per occurrence for each of these perils, with limits of $300 million per occurrence for all perils except earthquake, which has a total annual aggregate limit of $300 million.  terrorism coverage is limited to $200 million per occurrence related to property damage.  liability claims are limited to $151 million per occurrence.  should a loss occur at any of our properties that is subject to a substantial deductible or is in excess of the property or casualty insurance limits of our policies, we may lose part or all of our invested capital and revenues from such property, which may have a material adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.
terrorist activities or violence occurring at our properties also may directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction or loss.  insurance for such acts may be unavailable or cost more resulting in an increase to our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.  to the extent that our tenants are affected by such attacks and threats of attacks, their businesses may be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases.
loss of our key personnel may adversely affect our business and operations.
the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees may significantly impact our future performance. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot be assured that we will retain all of our executive management team and other key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future. losing any one or more of these persons may have an adverse effect on us.
we face competition from numerous sources, including other reits and other real estate owners.
the ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented. we face competition from other public reits, large private investors, institutional investors, and from numerous small owners in the acquisition, ownership, and leasing of shopping centers. we also compete to develop shopping centers with other reits engaged in development activities as well as with local, regional, and national real estate developers. this competition may:
•   reduce the number of properties available for acquisition or development;

•   increase the cost of properties available for acquisition or development; and

•   hinder our ability to attract and retain tenants, leading to increased vacancy rates and/or reduced rents.

if we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets, our cash flow, and therefore distributions to stock and unit holders, may be adversely affected.
costs of environmental remediation may reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders.
under various federal, state, and local laws, an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or addressing the presence of hazardous substances on the property, generally arising from dry cleaners, gas stations, and historic land use practices. these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous substances. the presence of, or the failure to properly address the presence of, hazardous substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral. we can provide no assurance that we are aware of all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that our properties will not be affected by tenants or nearby properties or other unrelated third parties; and that future uses or conditions, or changes in environmental laws and regulations will not result in additional material environmental liabilities to us.
compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make unexpected expenditures.
all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act ("ada"), which generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. compliance with ada requirements may require removal of access barriers, and noncompliance may result in imposition of fines by the u.s. government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both. while the tenants to whom we lease space in our properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions, and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance, if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these tenants to cover costs may be adversely affected. in addition, we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties. we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with these requirements, and these expenditures may have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders.
11
the unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of tenant or employee personal, financial or other data or of regency's proprietary or confidential information stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.
many of our information technology systems (including those we use for administration, accounting, and communications, as well as the systems of our co-investment partners and other third-party business partners and service providers, whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers) contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our tenants and employees. many of our information technology systems also contain our proprietary information and other confidential information related to our business. we are frequently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems. to the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party's information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of tenants' or employees' data or our confidential information stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, such a breach may damage our reputation and cause us to lose tenants and revenues, incur third party claims and cause disruption to our business and plans. such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable u.s. privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer, business partner, or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability, and we may not be able to recover these expenses from our service providers, responsible parties, or insurance carriers.
additionally, federal, state and local authorities continue to develop laws to address data privacy protection.  monitoring such changes, and taking steps to comply, involves significant costs and effort by management, which may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.
the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breaches of information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. we manage cyber risk by evaluating the impact of a potential cyber breach on our business and determining the level of investment in the prevention, detection and response to a breach. we continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.
despite the implementation of security measures for our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, our systems are vulnerable to damages from multiple sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failure.  any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business and cause us to incur additional costs to remedy such damages.
risk factors related to our partnerships and joint ventures we do not have voting control over all of the properties owned in our co-investment partnerships and joint ventures, so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued.
we have invested substantial capital as a partner in a number of partnerships and joint ventures to acquire, own, lease, develop or redevelop properties. these activities are subject to the same risks as our investments in our wholly-owned properties. these investments, and other future similar investments may involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt, suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness, or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. partners or other owners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives.
these investments, and other future similar investments, also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, such as a sale or financing, because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture. disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that may increase our expenses and prevent management from focusing their time and efforts on our business. consequently, actions by, or disputes with, partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. in addition, we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners. these factors may limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates.
the termination of our partnerships may adversely affect our cash flow, operating results, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.
if partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason, we could lose the asset, property management, leasing and construction management fees from these partnerships as well as the operating income of the properties, which may adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders.  certain of our partnership operating agreements provide either member the ability to elect buy/sell clauses.  the election of these dissolution provisions could require us to invest additional capital to acquire the partners' interest or to sell our share of the property thereby losing the operating income and cash flow.
12
risk factors related to funding strategies and capital structure our ability to sell properties and fund acquisitions and developments may be adversely impacted by higher market capitalization rates and lower noi at our properties which may dilute earnings.
as part of our funding strategy, we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards or those with a limited future growth profile. these sales proceeds are used to fund debt repayment, acquisition of operating properties, and the construction of new developments and redevelopments. an increase in market capitalization rates or a decline in noi may cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale, which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated.  additionally, the sale of properties resulting in significant tax gains may require higher distributions to our stockholders or payment of additional income taxes in order to maintain our reit status.
we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax-deferred contribution transactions, which may result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell such assets.
we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in our operating partnership, which may result in stockholder dilution. this acquisition structure may have the effect of, among other things, reducing the amount of tax depreciation we may deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and may require that we agree to protect the contributors' ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and/or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. these restrictions may limit our ability to sell an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions.
we depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all.
to qualify as a reit, the parent company must, among other things, distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90% of its reit taxable income (excluding any net capital gains). because of these distribution requirements, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs with income from operations. in such instances, we would rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of things, including the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings. our access to debt depends on our credit rating, the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets. in addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us, we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their pro rata share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our partnerships and joint ventures are eligible to refinance.
in addition, our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing. additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders' interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage.
without access to external sources of capital, we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales. our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate. if we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales, we may be forced to reduce the amount of, or eliminate altogether, our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business.
our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition.
our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance, which to a certain extent is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. in addition, we do not expect to generate sufficient operating cash flow to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due. if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced (i) to dispose of properties, which might result in losses, or (ii) to obtain financing at unfavorable terms, either of which may reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders. if we cannot make required mortgage payments, the mortgagee may foreclose on the property securing the mortgage.
covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition.
our unsecured notes, unsecured term loans, and unsecured line of credit contain customary covenants, including compliance with financial ratios, such as ratio of indebtedness to total asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio. these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our investment activities. moreover, if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements, and do not cure the breach within the applicable cure period, our lenders may require us to repay the debt immediately, even in the absence of a payment default. many of our debt arrangements, including our unsecured notes, unsecured term loan, and unsecured line of credit are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations. as a result, any default under our debt

covenants may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations, and the market value of our stock.
increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations.
although a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facility and term loan. as of december 31, 2019, 6.5% of our outstanding debt was variable rate debt not hedged to fixed. increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates. in addition, increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures, to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates. this would reduce our future earnings and cash flows, which may adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also may reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders.
hedging activity may expose us to risks, including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate, which may adversely affect us.
we manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements.  these arrangements involve risk, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, and that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes. there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will qualify for hedge accounting or that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations. should we desire to terminate a hedging arrangement, there may be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our obligations under the hedging arrangement. in addition, failure to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.
the interest rates on our unsecured credit facilities as well as on our variable rate mortgages and interest rate swaps might change based on changes to the method in which libor or its replacement rate is determined.
in july 2017, the financial conduct authority ("fca") that regulates libor announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021. as a result, the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york organized the alternative reference rates committee ("arrc") which identified the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") as its preferred alternative to usd-libor in derivatives and other financial contracts.  we are not able to predict when libor will cease to be available or when there will be sufficient liquidity in the sofr markets. any changes adopted by fca or other governing bodies in the method used for determining libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor. if that were to occur, our interest payments could change. in addition, uncertainty about the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher or lower than if libor were to remain available in its current form.
we have contracts that are indexed to libor, including our $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, $265 million term loan, and fifteen mortgages within our consolidated and unconsolidated portfolio totaling $225.5 million on a pro-rata basis, as well as interest rate swaps to fix these variable cash flows with notional amounts totaling $442.0 million on a pro-rata basis.  these libor based instruments mature between 2020 and 2028.  we are monitoring and evaluating the related risks, which include interest on loans or amounts received and paid on derivative instruments. these risks arise in connection with transitioning contracts to a new alternative rate, including any resulting value transfer that may occur. the value of loans, securities, or derivative instruments tied to libor could also be impacted if libor is limited or discontinued. for some instruments, the method of transitioning to an alternative rate may be challenging, as they may require negotiation with the respective counterparty.
if a contract is not transitioned to an alternative rate and libor is discontinued, the impact is likely to vary by contract. if libor is discontinued or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form, interest rates on our current or future indebtedness and related interest rate swaps may be adversely affected.
while we expect libor to be available in substantially its current form until the end of 2021, it is possible that libor will become unavailable prior to that point.  this could result, for example, if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the libor administrator. in that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified.

risk factors related to our company and the market price for our securities changes in economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our securities.
the market price of our debt and equity securities may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, many of which are out of our control, including:
•   actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;

•   changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates;

•   publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry in general and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other reits;

•   the ability of our tenants to pay rent and meet their other obligations to us under current lease terms and our ability to re-lease space as leases expire;

•   increases in market interest rates that drive purchasers of our stock to demand a higher dividend yield;

•   changes in market valuations of similar companies;

•   adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;

•   any future issuances of equity securities;

•   additions or departures of key management personnel;

•   strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;

•   actions by institutional stockholders;

•   reports by corporate governance rating companies;

•   increased investor focus on sustainability-related risks, including climate change;

•   changes in our dividend payments;

•   potential tax law changes on reits;

•   speculation in the press or investment community; and

•   general market and economic conditions.

these factors may cause the market price of our securities to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects. it is impossible to ensure that the market price of our securities, including our common stock, will not fall in the future.  a decrease in the market price of our common stock may reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets. selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders.
there is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates.
our ability to continue to pay dividends at historical rates or to increase our dividend rate will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the following:
•   our financial condition and results of future operations;

•   the terms of our loan covenants; and

•   our ability to acquire, finance, develop or redevelop and lease additional properties at attractive rates.

if we do not maintain or periodically increase the dividend on our common stock, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and other securities.
15
enhanced focus on corporate responsibility and sustainability, specifically related to environmental, social and governance matters, may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.
we, as well as increasing numbers of investors, are focused on corporate responsibility and sustainability, specifically related to environmental, social and governance matters ("esg"). some investors may use these matters to guide their investment strategies. third-party providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports on companies have increased to meet growing investor demand for measurement of corporate responsibility performance. although we have generally scored highly in these metrics to date, there can be no assurance that we will continue to score highly in the future. in addition, the criteria by which companies are rated may change, which could cause us to receive lower scores than in the past. we may face reputational damage in the event our corporate responsibility and sustainability procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies. furthermore, should our competitors outperform us in such metrics, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competition instead. the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on the price of our shares and our business, financial condition and results of operations, including increased capital expenditures and/or increased operating expenses.
risk factors related to laws and regulations if the parent company fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.
we believe that the parent company qualifies for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit. if the parent company continues to qualify as a reit, it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. many reit requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. the determination that the parent company is a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances, some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation. for example, to qualify as a reit, at least 95% of our gross income must come from specific passive sources, like rent, that are itemized in the reit tax laws. there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service ("irs") or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the reit requirements. we are also required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our reit taxable income, excluding net capital gains. we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. the fact that we hold many of our assets through co-investment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements. furthermore, congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings, that make it more difficult for the parent company to remain qualified as a reit.
also, unless the irs granted relief under certain statutory provisions, the parent company would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year it first failed to qualify. if the parent company failed to qualify as a reit (currently and/or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we would have to pay significant income taxes, reducing cash available to pay dividends, which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. in addition, we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders in order to maintain our reit status. although we believe that the parent company qualifies as a reit, we cannot be assured that the parent company will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes.
even if the parent company qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes, we are required to pay certain federal, state, and local taxes on our income and property. for example, if we have net income from "prohibited transactions," that income will be subject to a 100% tax. in general, prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale. while we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years, we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions, but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise.
new legislation, as well as new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions may be introduced, enacted, or promulgated from time to time, that may change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit, or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that is adverse to our stockholders.
recent changes to the u.s. tax laws may have a significant negative impact on the overall economy, our tenants, our investors, and our business.
the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 made significant changes to the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). while the changes in the tax cuts and jobs act generally appear to be favorable with respect to reits, the extensive changes to non-reit provisions in the code may have unanticipated effects on us or our stockholders, including our taxable income, the amount of distributions to our stockholders required in order to maintain our reit status, and our relative tax advantage as a reit. the long-term impact of the tax cuts and jobs act on the overall economy, government revenues, our tenants, us, and the real estate industry cannot be reliably predicted at this stage of the new law's implementation. furthermore, the tax cuts and jobs act may negatively impact certain of our tenants' operating results, financial condition, and future business plans. the tax cuts and jobs act may also
16
result in reduced government revenues, and therefore reduced government spending, which may negatively impact some of our tenants that rely on government funding.  there can be no assurance that the tax cuts and jobs act will not adversely impact our operating results, financial condition, and future business operations.
dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates.
subject to limited exceptions, dividends paid by reits (other than distributions designated as capital gain dividends, qualified dividends or returns of capital) are not eligible for reduced rates for qualified dividends paid by "c" corporations and are taxable at ordinary income tax rates. the more favorable tax rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends may cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-reit corporations that pay dividends, which may adversely affect the value of the shares of reits, including the shares of our capital stock.
under the recently passed tax cuts and jobs act, the rate brackets for non-corporate taxpayer's ordinary income are adjusted, the top tax rate is reduced from 39.6% to 37% (excluding the 3.8% medicare tax on net investment income), and ordinary reit dividends are taxed at even lower effective rates. under the tax cuts and jobs act, for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017, and before january 1, 2026, distributions from reits that are treated as dividends but are not designated as qualified dividends or capital gain dividends are generally taxed as ordinary income after deducting 20% of the amount of the dividend in the case of non-corporate stockholders. at the maximum ordinary income tax rate of 37% applicable for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017, and before january 1, 2026, the maximum tax rate on ordinary reit dividends for non-corporate stockholders is generally 29.6% (plus the 3.8% medicare tax on net investment income).
certain foreign stockholders may be subject to u.s. federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a "domestically controlled" reit.
a foreign person disposing of a u.s. real property interest, including shares of a u.s. corporation whose assets consist principally of u.s. real property interests is generally subject to u.s. federal income tax on any gain recognized on the disposition. this tax does not apply, however, to the disposition of stock in a reit if the reit is "domestically controlled." in general, we will be a domestically controlled reit if at all times during the five-year period ending on the applicable stockholder's disposition of our stock, less than 50% in value of our stock was held directly or indirectly by non-u.s. persons. if we were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled reit, gain recognized by a foreign stockholder on a disposition of our common stock would be subject to u.s. federal income tax unless our common stock was traded on an established securities market and the foreign stockholder did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 10% of our outstanding common stock.
legislative or other actions affecting reits may have a negative effect on us.
the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the u.s. department of the treasury. changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, may adversely affect regency or our investors. we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect regency or our investors. new legislation, treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, may change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit.
complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.
the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge our liabilities. generally, income from a hedging transaction that constitutes "qualifying income" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests applicable to reits, does not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, provided that we properly identify the hedging transaction pursuant to the applicable sections of the code and treasury regulations. to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, or fail to make the proper tax identifications, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests. as a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of otherwise advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable reit subsidiary ("trs").
restrictions on the ownership of the parent company's capital stock to preserve its reit status may delay or prevent a change in control.
ownership of more than 7% by value of our outstanding capital stock is prohibited, with certain exceptions, by the parent company's articles of incorporation, for the purpose of maintaining its qualification as a reit. this 7% limitation may discourage a change in control and may also (i) deter tender offers for our capital stock, which offers may be attractive to our stockholders, or (ii) limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7% of our outstanding capital stock or to affect a change in control.
17
the issuance of the parent company's capital stock may delay or prevent a change in control.
the parent company's articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 10,000,000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued. the issuance of preferred stock or special common stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. the provisions of the florida business corporation act regarding affiliated transactions may also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executing on our strategy we had net income attributable to the company of $239.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2019, as compared to $249.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2018.
we sustained same property noi growth:
•   we attained pro-rata same property noi growth, excluding termination fees, of 2.1%.

•   we executed 1,702 leasing transactions representing 6.1 million pro-rata sf of new and renewal leasing with trailing twelve month rent spreads of 8.5% on comparable retail operating property spaces.

•   at december 31, 2019, our total property portfolio was 94.8% leased while our same property portfolio was 95.1% leased.

we continued our development and redevelopment of high quality shopping centers at attractive returns on investment:
•   we started a new development representing a total pro-rata investment of $27.3 million upon completion with a projected return on investment of 6.0%.

•   we started 11 new redevelopments representing a total incremental pro-rata investment of $237.2 million upon completion with a weighted average projected return on investment of 6.9%, including $74.7 million for two future phases at serramonte center.

•   including these projects, a total of 22 properties were in the process of development or redevelopment as of december 31, 2019 representing a pro-rata investment upon completion of $350.8 million.

•   we completed six new developments during 2019 representing a total pro-rata investment of $223.2 million with a weighted average return on investment of 7.2%.

•   we completed three new redevelopments during 2019 representing a total incremental pro-rata investment of $7.6 million with a weighted average return on investment of 7.0%.

we maintained a conservative balance sheet providing financial flexibility to cost effectively fund investment opportunities and debt maturities:
•   on march 6, 2019, we issued $300.0 million of 4.65% senior unsecured public notes, which priced at 99.661%, and mature in march 2049. the net proceeds of the offering were used to repay in full our $250 million 4.8% notes due april 15, 2021, including a make-whole premium of approximately $9.6 million and accrued interest. the remaining proceeds were used toward repaying in full two mortgages for $52.7 million with interest rates ranging between 6.25% and 7.25%, including a repayment premium of $1.0 million.

•   on august 13, 2019, we issued $425.0 million of 2.95% senior unsecured public notes, which priced at 99.903% and mature in september 2029. the net proceeds of the offering were used to repay in full our $300.0 million term loan that was due to mature in december 2020, including an interest rate swap breakage fee of approximately $1.1 million, and to reduce the outstanding balance on our line.

•   during september 2019, we entered into forward sale agreements under our atm program through which we will issue 1,894,845 shares of common stock at an average offering price of $67.99. the shares under the forward sales agreements may be settled at any time before the required settlement date of september 12, 2020. proceeds from the issuance of shares are expected to be used to fund acquisitions of operating properties, to fund developments and redevelopments, and for general corporate purposes. no shares have been settled through december 31, 2019.

•   at december 31, 2019, our annualized net debt-to-operating ebitdare ratio on a pro-rata basis was 5.4x.

total weighted average base rent on signed shop space leases during 2019 was $33.59 psf and exceeds the average annual base rent of all shop space leases due to expire during the next 12 months of $32.56 psf.  the increase in tenant allowance and landlord work committed on new anchor leases signed in 2019 is attributable to anchor deals that include costs to either convert units to a specialized use, deliver new gla, or demise units to accommodate smaller tenant formats.

bankruptcies and credit concerns our management team devotes significant time to researching and monitoring retail trends, consumer preferences, customer shopping behaviors, changes in retail delivery methods, and changing demographics in order to anticipate the challenges and opportunities impacting the retail industry. a greater shift to e-commerce could negatively impact our tenants' sales potentially resulting in large scale business failures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. we seek to mitigate these potential impacts through tenant diversification, replacing weaker tenants with stronger operators, anchoring our centers with market leading grocery stores that drive foot traffic, and maintaining a presence in affluent suburbs and dense infill trade areas. as a result of our research and findings, we may reduce new leasing, suspend leasing, or curtail allowances for construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer in order to reduce our risk from bankruptcies and store closings.
we closely monitor the operating performance and rent collections of tenants in our shopping centers as well as those retailers experiencing significant changes to their business models as a result of reduced customer traffic in their stores and increased competition from e-commerce sales. retailers that are unable to withstand these and other business pressures, such as significant debt maturities, may file for bankruptcy. although base rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants filing for bankruptcy protection generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims. as a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold. for operating leases in which collectability of lease income is not probable, lease income is recognized on a cash basis and all previously recognized lease income is reversed in the period in which the lease income is determined not to be probable of collection.  additionally, we may incur significant expense to adjudicate our claim and to release the vacated space. in the event that a tenant with a significant amount of annualized base rent files bankruptcy and cancels its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues. tenants who are currently in bankruptcy and continue to occupy space in our shopping centers at december 31, 2019, represent an aggregate of 0.6% of our annual base rent on a pro-rata basis, which includes 0.5% for the 57,000 square foot barneys' space in new york.  the barneys' lease is expected to terminate in february 2020.

(1)   as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, regency adopted asc topic 842, leases, using the modified retrospective adoption method as of january 1, 2019, and elected to apply the transition provisions of the standard at the beginning of the period of adoption. as such, the prior period amounts prepared and presented under the former asc topic 840, leases, were not restated, but were reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. part of the practical expedients in asc topic 842 allow management to avoid separating lease and non-lease components of lease income, therefore all lease income earned pursuant to tenant leases, including recoveries from tenants and percentage rent, in 2019 and as reclassified for 2018 and 2017, is reflected in lease income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

lease income increased $10.5 million, driven by the following contractually billable components of rent from tenants per the lease agreements:
$12.6 million increase from billable base rent, as follows:
•   $12.4 million increase from rent commencing at development properties;

•   $6.2 million increase from acquisitions of operating properties; and

•   $13.5 million net increase from same properties due to rental rate growth on new and renewal leases and rent steps in existing leases; reduced by

•   $19.5 million decrease from the sale of operating properties.

$1.8 million increase from billable recoveries from tenants, which represents amounts contractually billable to tenants per the terms of the lease for their reimbursement to us for the tenants' pro-rata share of the operating, maintenance, and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers. recoveries from tenants increased, on a net basis, as follows:
•   $4.0 million increase from rent commencing at development properties; and

•   $3.5 million increase from acquisitions of operating properties; reduced by

•   $520,000 decrease from same properties, due to a net decrease in the amount of recoverable expenses; and

•   $5.2 million decrease from the sale of operating properties.

$8.7 million decrease in straight-line rent driven by a $4.8 million decrease for known or expected early lease terminations and a $3.9 million net decrease driven by timing of contractual rent steps.
$10.5 million increase in above and below market rent accretion, as follows:
•   $2.8 million increase primarily driven by accelerated below-market rent accretion for an early lease termination at a recently acquired property;

•   $7.4 million increase from same properties primarily driven by $8.8 million of accelerated below-market rent accretion for expected early lease terminations; and

•   $352,000 increase from the sale of operating properties, which had greater above market rent amortization in 2018.

$5.4 million decrease related to uncollectible lease income recorded as a direct charge against lease income beginning on january 1, 2019, with the adoption of asc 842, leases.  during the year ended december 31, 2018, uncollectible lease income of $5.0 million was recorded as provision for doubtful accounts included in other operating expenses below.
41
management, transaction and other fees increased $1.1 million primarily due to an increase in development fees from projects within our unconsolidated partnerships.
changes in our operating expenses are summarized in the following table:

(1)   beginning with the adoption of asc 842, leases, on january 1, 2019, uncollectible lease income is a direct charge against lease income, which totaled $5.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2019.

depreciation and amortization costs changed as follows:
•   $5.8 million increase as we began depreciating costs at development properties where tenant spaces were completed and became available for occupancy;

•   $8.9 million net increase from acquisitions of operating properties; and

•   $10.6 million net increase at same properties, primarily attributable to additional depreciation at redevelopment properties; reduced by

•   $10.7 million decrease from the sale of operating properties.

operating and maintenance costs changed as follows:
•   $3.6 million increase from operations commencing at development properties; and

•   $1.9 million increase at same properties, primarily attributable to $2.7 million of increases in recoverable costs, offset by a reduction in termination fee expense; reduced by

•   $3.7 million decrease from the sale of operating properties.

general and administrative changed as follows:
•   $8.2 million increase due to eliminating capitalization of non-contingent internal leasing costs and legal costs associated with leasing activities upon the adoption of asc 842, leases, on january 1, 2019; and

•   $6.3 million increase in the value of participant obligations within the deferred compensation plan; reduced by

•   $3.4 million decrease from higher development overhead capitalization based on the timing and size of current development and redevelopment projects; and

•   $1.6 million net decrease in compensation and other corporate overhead costs, primarily driven by lower incentive compensation.

42
real estate taxes changed as follows:
•   $2.7 million increase from development properties where capitalization ceased as tenant spaces became available for occupancy; and

•   $1.9 million increase from acquisitions of operating properties; offset by

•   $3.7 million decrease at same properties from successful tax appeals with refunds received in 2019 and 2018 including increases for post-merger tax reassessments; and

•   $2.5 million decrease from the sale of operating properties.

provision for doubtful accounts was $5.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2018.  beginning with the adoption of asc 842, leases, on january 1, 2019, uncollectible lease income is a direct charge against lease income.  the uncollectible lease income was $5.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2019, reflecting changes in collection expectations.
other operating expenses increased $3.1 million, attributable to environmental remediation costs within our same properties and increased development pursuit costs.

the $2.8 million net increase in total interest expense is primarily due to:
•   $2.1 million net increase in interest on notes payable due to additional unsecured debt offerings to fund the repayment of our $300.0 million term loan and several mortgages;

•   $2.8 million increase from lower capitalization of interest based on the size and progress of development and redevelopment projects in process; reduced by

•   $1.4 million decrease in interest on unsecured credit facilities due to repayment of our $300 million term loan in august 2019; and

•   $0.7 million decrease as a result of a previously settled forward hedge for a ten year unsecured note issuance fully amortizing in early 2019.

during 2019, we recognized $54.2 million of impairment losses, including $3.1 million of goodwill impairment, on six operating properties, three of which have been sold.  during 2018, we recognized $38.4 million of impairment losses, including $12.6 million of goodwill impairment, on ten operating properties and two land parcels, all of which have sold.  one of the remaining three properties that was impaired in 2019 is our 101 7th avenue center in new york, which was occupied by a single retail tenant, barneys, who filed bankruptcy and is expected to terminate their lease in february 2020.  as a result, management reassessed the expected hold period of the property as well as its highest and best use, resulting in a $40.3 million impairment loss to reduce the carrying value to its estimated fair value.
during 2019, we sold five operating properties and six land parcels for gains totaling $24.2 million.  during 2018, we sold six operating properties and seven land parcels for gains totaling $28.3 million.
net investment income increased $6.7 million, driven by valuation changes in the stock market, primarily attributable to investments held within the non-qualified deferred compensation plan.

supplemental earnings information we use certain non-gaap performance measures, in addition to certain performance metrics determined under gaap, as we believe these measures improve the understanding of our operating results. we provide pro-rata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships, when read in conjunction with the company's reported results under gaap. we believe presenting our pro-rata share of operating results, along with other non-gaap measures, may assist in comparing the company's operating results to other reits. we continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-gaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change. see "defined terms" in part i, item 1.

(1)   represents amounts included within lease income, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and further discussed in note 1, that are contractually billable to the tenant per the terms of the lease agreements.

(2)   beginning with the adoption of asc 842, leases, on january 1, 2019, uncollectible lease income is a direct charge against lease income. provision for doubtful accounts was included in total real estate operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2018.

billable base rent increased $15.2 million, driven by increases in rental rate growth on new and renewal leases and contractual rent steps in existing leases, partially offset by a decline in rent paying occupancy.
operating and maintenance costs increased $3.6 million due to increases in recoverable costs, including insurance, security, and property maintenance, offset by decreases in snow removal costs.
termination expense decreased $1.2 million due to more significant costs in 2018 to terminate specific tenant leases.
real estate taxes decreased $3.5 million due to successful supplemental tax appeal receipts at certain properties in 2019.  in addition, 2018 included higher real estate tax expense related to supplemental tax bills received from the 2017 merger with equity one.

liquidity and capital resources general we use cash flows generated from operating, investing, and financing activities to strengthen our balance sheet, finance our development and redevelopment projects, fund our investment activities, and maintain financial flexibility. we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt or equity, to repay maturing debt, or fund our capital commitments.
except for $500 million of unsecured public and private placement debt, our parent company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our operating partnership. all remaining debt is held by our operating partnership or by our co-investment partnerships. the operating partnership is a co-issuer and a guarantor of the $500 million of outstanding debt of our parent company. the parent company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the operating partnership in exchange for additional partnership units. based upon our available sources of capital, our current credit ratings, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties we own, we believe our available capital resources are sufficient to meet our expected capital needs.
in addition to our $113.0 million of unrestricted cash at december 31, 2019, we have the following additional sources of capital available:

our dividend distribution policy is set by our board of directors, who monitors our financial position.  our board of directors recently declared a common stock dividend of $0.595 per share, payable on march 5, 2020, to shareholders of record as of february 24, 2020.  future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and will be subject to capital requirements and availability.  we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that, at a minimum, meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a reit for federal income tax purposes.
we expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our dividend distributions. we generated cash flow from operations of approximately $621.3 million and $610.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. we paid $391.6 million and $376.8 million to our common stock and unit holders for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
we estimate that we will require capital during the next twelve months of approximately $391.2 million to fund construction and related costs for in-process developments and redevelopments, to repay maturing debt, and to make capital contributions to our co-investment partnerships. we expect to generate the necessary cash to fund our capital needs from future cash flow from operations after dividends paid, borrowings from our line, proceeds from the sale of real estate, and when the capital markets are favorable, proceeds from the sale of equity or the issuance of new debt.
if we start new developments or redevelopments, commit to new acquisitions, prepay debt prior to maturity, or repurchase shares of our common stock, our cash requirements will increase. in addition, at december 31, 2019, we had an agreement related to our ownership interest in the town and country center in los angeles, ca, to purchase an additional 16.62% ownership interest in this center for approximately $18.1 million.  we closed on the purchase in january 2020.
we endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets. as of december 31, 2019, 88.6% of our wholly-owned real estate assets were unencumbered. such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain availability on the line.
our annualized fixed charge coverage ratio, including our pro-rata share of our partnerships, was 4.3 times and 4.2 times for the periods ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
our line, term loan, and unsecured debt require that we remain in compliance with various covenants, which are described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31, 2019, and expect to remain in compliance.

significant investing and divesting activities included:
•   we acquired four operating properties for $222.4 million during 2019 and three operating properties for $85.3 million during 2018.

•   we invested $26.2 million less in 2019 than 2018 on real estate development, redevelopment, and capital improvements, as further detailed in a table below.

•   we received proceeds of $137.6 million from the sale of seven shopping centers and six land parcels in 2019, compared to $250.4 million for ten shopping centers and nine land parcels in 2018.

•   we received property insurance claim proceeds of $9.4 million during 2019 attributable to a single property that was severely damaged by a tornado in the current year.

•   we received $15.6 million upon the collection of two notes in 2018.

•   we invested $66.9 million in our real estate partnerships during 2019, including:

o   $44.3 million to fund our share of development and redevelopment activities,

o   $9.7 million to fund our share of acquiring an additional equity interest in one partnership,

o   $8.2 million to fund our share of acquiring land under one shopping center that was previously under a ground lease, and

o   $4.7 million to fund our share of repayments for maturing debt.

during the same period in 2018, we invested $74.2 million in our real estate partnerships, including:
o   $48.8 million to fund our share of acquiring four operating properties,

o   $21.9 million to fund our share of development and redevelopment activities,

o   $1.3 million to acquire an interest in one land parcel for development, and

o   $2.2 million to fund our share of maturing debt.

•   distributions from our unconsolidated real estate partnerships include return of capital from sales or financing proceeds. the $63.7 million received in 2019 is driven by the sale of three operating properties, the sale of our ownership interest in a single operating property partnership, and our share of proceeds from debt financing activities. during the same period in 2018, we received $14.6 million from the sale of one land parcel and one operating property plus our share of proceeds from debt financing activities.

•   dividends on securities, acquisition of securities, and proceeds from sale of securities pertain to investment activities held in our captive insurance company and our deferred compensation plan.

we plan to continue developing and redeveloping shopping centers for long-term investment purposes.  during 2019, we deployed capital of $200.0 million for the development, redevelopment, and improvement of our real estate properties as comprised of the following:

•   during 2019, we acquired two land parcels for new development and redevelopment projects as compared to three land parcels during 2018.

•   building and tenant improvements decreased $6.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily related to the timing of capital projects.

•   redevelopment expenditures were higher during 2019 due to the timing, magnitude, and number of projects in process. we intend to continuously improve our portfolio of shopping centers through redevelopment which can include adjacent land acquisition, existing building expansion, façade renovations, new out-parcel building construction, and redevelopment related tenant improvement costs. the size and magnitude of each redevelopment project varies with each redevelopment plan. the timing and duration of these projects, which generally includes tenant vacancies before and during the redevelopment, could also result in volatility in noi. see the tables below for more details about our redevelopment projects.

•   development expenditures were lower in 2019 based on the progress towards completion of our development projects in process. at december 31, 2019 and 2018, we had three and six consolidated development projects, respectively, that were either under construction or in lease up. see the tables below for more details about our development projects.

•   interest is capitalized on our development and redevelopment projects and is based on cumulative actual costs expended. we cease interest capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor opens for business.

•   we have a staff of employees who directly support our development program, which includes redevelopment of our existing properties. we currently expect that our development and redevelopment activities will approximate our recent historical averages, although the amount of activity by type will vary. internal compensation costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized as part of each project. changes in the level of future development activity could adversely impact results of operations by reducing the amount of internal costs for development projects that may be capitalized. a 10% reduction in either development or redevelopment activity without a corresponding reduction in related compensation costs could result in an additional charge to net income of $1.5 million per year.

significant financing activities during the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 include the following:
•   we repurchased for cash a portion of the common stock granted to employees for stock based compensation to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements, which totaled $6.2 million and $6.8 million during the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018.

•   we paid $32.8 million to repurchase 563,229 common shares through our prior share repurchase program that were executed in december 2018 but not settled until january 2019. during 2018, we paid $213.9 million to repurchase 3,689,104 common shares through our repurchase program.

•   net distributions to limited partners in consolidated partnerships decreased by $1.2 million primarily due to contributions made by a new limited partner during 2019.

•   we paid $14.9 million more in dividends during 2019 as a result of an increase in our dividend rate from $2.22 per share during 2018 to $2.34 per share during 2019, partially offset by the reduced shares outstanding during 2019 resulting from our common stock repurchases executed during 2018.

•   we had the following debt related activity during 2019:

o   we borrowed, net of repayments, an additional $75.0 million on our line.

o   we received total proceeds of $723.6 million upon the issuance of two senior unsecured public note offerings during 2019.

o   we paid $624.7 million for other debt repayments, including:

▪   $259.6 million to redeem our senior unsecured public notes originally due april 2021;

▪   $300 million for repayment of a term loan originally due december 2020;

▪   $53.7 million to repay two mortgages; and

▪   $12.4 million in principal mortgage payments.

o   we paid $7.0 million of loan costs in connection with our two public note offerings above.

•   we had the following debt related activity during 2018:

o   we borrowed, net of payments, an additional $85.0 million on our line.

o   we received proceeds of $301.3 million from debt issuances, including $299.5 million of senior unsecured public notes and $1.7 million from construction loan draws used to fund an in-process development project.

o   we paid $283.5 million for other debt payments, including $160.5 million to early redeem our senior unsecured public notes originally due june 2020, $113 million to repay four mortgages, and $10 million in scheduled principal mortgage payments.

o   we paid $9.4 million of loan costs in connection with our public note offering above and expanding our line commitment.

contractual obligations we have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans, unsecured notes, unsecured credit facilities, interest rate swap obligations, and lease agreements as described further below and in note 7, note 9, and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. we have shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct and/or operate a shopping center. we also have non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business. in addition, at december 31, 2019, we had a contractual commitment to purchase an additional 16.62% ownership interest in our town and country shopping center, bringing our ownership interest to 35%.  we closed on the purchase in january 2020 for $18.1 million.
the following table of contractual obligations summarizes our debt maturities, including our pro-rata share of obligations within co-investment partnerships as of december 31, 2019, and excludes the following:
•   recorded debt premiums or discounts and issuance costs that are not obligations;

•   obligations related to construction or development contracts, since payments are only due upon satisfactory performance under the contracts;

•   letters of credit of $12.5 million issued to cover our captive insurance program and performance obligations on certain development projects, which the latter will be satisfied upon completion of the development projects; and

•   obligations for retirement savings plans due to uncertainty around timing of participant withdrawals, which are solely within the control of the participant, and are further discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

(2)   we are obligated to contribute our pro-rata share to fund maturities if they are not refinanced. we believe that our partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements. in the event that a co-investment partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the co-investment partnership, we would have the right, but not the obligation, to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call.

critical accounting estimates knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements. the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period. these accounting estimates are based upon, but not limited to, our judgments about historical and expected future results, current market conditions, and interpretation of industry accounting standards. they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments, or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates. we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness; however, the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates.
accounts receivable and straight line rent lease income, which includes base rent, percentage rent, and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs, insurance and real estate taxes are the company's principal source of revenue. as a result of generating this revenue, we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants. additionally, we recognize lease income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, which generally results in straight line rent receivable for future contractual rent steps.
lease income for operating leases with fixed payment terms is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease for all leases for which collectibility is considered probable at the commencement date.  at lease commencement, the company generally expects that collectibility is probable due to the company's credit assessment of tenants and other creditworthiness analysis undertaken before entering into a new lease; therefore, income from most operating leases is initially recognized on a straight-line basis.  for operating leases in which collectibility of lease income is not considered probable, lease income is recognized on a cash basis and all previously recognized uncollectible lease income is reversed in the period in which the lease income is determined not to be probable of collection.  in addition to the lease-specific collectibility assessment performed under topic 842, the company also recognizes a general reserve, as a reduction to lease income, for its portfolio of operating lease receivables which are not expected to be fully collectible based on the company's historical collection experience.  although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates.
real estate investments acquisition of real estate investments upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases and in-place leases), assumed debt, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. based on these estimates, the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities. transaction costs associated with asset acquisitions are capitalized, while such costs are expensed for business combinations in the period incurred.  beginning in july 2017, the company adopted accounting standard update 2017-01, business combinations (topic 805):  clarifying the definition of a business, under which the acquisition of operating properties are generally considered asset acquisitions.  if, however, the acquisition is determined to be a business combination, any excess consideration above the fair value allocated to the applicable assets and liabilities results in goodwill. fair value is determined based on an exit price approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
the company's methodology for determining fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities includes estimating an "as-if vacant" fair value of the physical property, which includes land, building, and improvements.  in addition, the company determines the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, considering the following categories: (i) value of in-place leases, and (ii) above and below-market value of in-place leases.
the value of in-place leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases compared to the acquired in-place leases as well as the value associated with lost rental and recovery revenue during the assumed lease-up period.  the value of in-place leases is recorded to depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the remaining expected term of the respective leases.
above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for comparable in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease, including below-market renewal options, if applicable.  the value of above-market leases is amortized as a reduction of lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and the value of below-market leases is accreted to lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases, including below-market renewal options, if applicable.
changes to these assumptions could result in a different pattern of recognition.  if tenants do not remain in their lease through the expected term or exercise an assumed renewal option, there could be a material impact to earnings.

development and redevelopment of real estate assets and cost capitalization we have a development program, which includes development of new shopping centers and redevelopment of our existing shopping centers. we capitalize the acquisition of land, the construction of buildings, and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them in real estate assets, at cost, in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. other specifically identifiable development costs include pre-development costs essential to the development process, as well as, interest, real estate taxes, and direct employee costs incurred during the development period. once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy, these indirect costs are no longer capitalized.
•   pre-development costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits, legal, engineering, and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center. if we determine it is probable that a specific project undergoing due diligence will not be developed, we immediately expense all related capitalized pre-development costs not considered recoverable.

•   interest costs are capitalized to each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended. we cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor opens for business. during the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we capitalized interest of $4.2 million, $7.0 million, and $7.9 million, respectively, on our development projects.

•   real estate taxes are capitalized to each development project over the same period as we capitalize interest.

•   we have a staff of employees directly supporting our development and redevelopment program. all direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project. the capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring. during the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we capitalized $20.4 million, $17.1 million, and $17.6 million, respectively, of direct internal costs incurred to support our development program.

valuation of real estate investments in accordance with gaap, we evaluate our real estate for impairment whenever there are indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the carrying value of our real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable. if such indicators occur, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, expected leasing activity, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated hold period, comparable sales information, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate. these key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment, if any, could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arm's length transaction. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.
the fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available, as well as the use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach.  such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors, and therefore is subject to management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value.  in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.  changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the company's financial condition or operating performance.
we evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are indicators, including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired. an investment in a real estate partnership is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an other-than-temporary basis. cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors, such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is other-than-temporary. these factors include the age of the real estate partnerships, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, and the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity. if we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, no impairment charge is recorded. if our analysis indicates that there is an other-than-temporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnership, the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment.

recent accounting pronouncements see note 1 to consolidated financial statements.
environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining primarily to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, underground petroleum storage tanks, and other historic land use practices. we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations. generally, we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems. where available, we have been accepted into state-sponsored environmental programs. we have a blanket environmental insurance policy for third-party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination. we have also placed environmental insurance, where possible, on specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate our environmental risk. we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites. we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so.
as of december 31, 2019, we and our investments in real estate partnerships had accrued liabilities of $9.4 million for our pro-rata share of environmental remediation. we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations; however, we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities (other than our unconsolidated investment partnerships) or other persons, also known as variable interest entities, not previously discussed. many of our unconsolidated investment partnerships' operating properties have been financed with non-recourse loans, to which we have no repayment guarantees.
inflation/deflation inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers; however, inflation may become a greater concern in the near future. most all of our long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation, which require tenants to pay their pro-rata share of operating expenses, including common-area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. in addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates. however, during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness, base rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines. occupancy declines will result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses.

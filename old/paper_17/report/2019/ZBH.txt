item 1a.   risk factors

we operate in a rapidly changing economic and technological environment that presents numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict.  our business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors.  in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations, including causing our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.  the following list of significant risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance.  additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may materially adversely affect us in future periods.  you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.
if we fail to comply with the terms of the dpa that we entered into in january 2017, we may be subject to criminal prosecution and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
on january 12, 2017, we resolved previously-disclosed fcpa matters involving biomet and certain of its subsidiaries.  as part of the settlement, we entered into a dpa with the doj.  a copy of the dpa is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this report.
if we do not comply with the terms of the dpa, we could be subject to prosecution for violating the internal controls provisions of the fcpa and the conduct of biomet and its subsidiaries described in the dpa, which conduct pre-dated our acquisition of biomet, as well as any new or continuing violations.  we could also be subject to exclusion by oig-hhs from participation in federal healthcare programs, including medicare, medicaid and veterans administration health programs.  any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our restructuring program may not be successful or we may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from our restructuring initiatives.
in december 2019, our board of directors approved, and we initiated, a new global restructuring program that includes a restructuring of key businesses to better align our resources with our growth strategies, achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs, simplify our organizational structure, accelerate decision-making and allow us to invest in higher priority growth opportunities.  restructuring initiatives involve complex plans and actions that may include, or result in, workforce reductions, global plant closures and/or consolidations, product portfolio rationalizations and asset impairments.  additionally, as a result of restructuring initiatives, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiencies during transitional periods.  restructuring initiatives present significant risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating enhancements and/or cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, including higher than anticipated costs in implementing our restructuring program, as well as management distraction. for more information on our restructuring program, see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.  if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
14
we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses into our operations or achieve expected cost savings or profitability from our acquisitions.
our acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:
•   unforeseen difficulties in integrating personnel and sales forces, operations, manufacturing, logistics, research and development, information technology, communications, purchasing, accounting, marketing, administration and other systems and processes;

•   difficulties harmonizing and optimizing quality systems and operations;

•   diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;

•   unforeseen difficulties related to entering geographic regions where we do not have prior experience;

•   potential loss of key employees;

•   unforeseen risks and liabilities associated with businesses acquired, including any unknown vulnerabilities in acquired technology or compromises of acquired data; and

•   inability to generate sufficient revenue or realize sufficient cost savings to offset acquisition or investment costs.

as a result, if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions properly, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate.  these risks would likely be greater in the case of larger acquisitions.
interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we have manufacturing sites all over the world.  in some instances, however, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants.  damage to one or more of our facilities from weather or natural disaster-related events, vulnerabilities in our technology, cyber-attacks against our information systems (such as ransomware attacks), or issues in our manufacturing arising from failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, compliance concerns relating to the qsr and good manufacturing practice requirements, equipment breakdown or malfunction or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products.  in the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand.  in the event of a significant interruption, for example, as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to the need for regulatory approvals.  as a result, we may experience loss of market share, which we may be unable to recapture, and harm to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products or the sterilization of our products by third-party suppliers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from third-party suppliers and we outsource some key manufacturing activities.  certain of these materials and components and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources due to quality considerations, expertise, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements.  in certain cases, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials or components or outsourced activities in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of fda regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our suppliers' manufacturing processes.  a reduction or interruption in the supply of materials or components used in manufacturing our products; an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required; or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service.  to the extent we or our contract sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products, whether due to capacity, availability of materials for sterilization, regulatory or other constraints, including federal and state regulations on the use of ethylene oxide, we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizers,
15
sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
moreover, we are subject to the sec's rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as "conflict minerals" (tantalum, tin and tungsten (or their ores) and gold), which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries.  this rule could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products, which could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.  in addition, we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule, including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products.  we have a complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through our due diligence procedures.  as a result, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders.
we are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations relating to the development, design, product standards, packaging, advertising, promotion, postmarket surveillance, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent, unpredictable and complex. the products we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other supranational, national, federal, regional, state and local governmental authorities.  the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and clearances to market these products can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all.  delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs.
both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations and other supranational, national, federal, regional, state and local requirements globally.  compliance with these requirements, including the qsr, recordkeeping regulations, labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations, is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda and other regulators, which may result in observations (such as on form 483), and in some cases warning letters, that require corrective action, or other forms of enforcement.  if the fda or another regulator were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, they could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of payment of such products, refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications, refuse to provide certificates for exports, and/or require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health.  the fda or other regulators may also impose operating restrictions, including a ceasing of operations at one or more facilities, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to our products, seizure of products and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us.  the fda or other regulators could also issue a corporate warning letter or a recidivist warning letter or negotiate the entry of a consent decree of permanent injunction with us, and/or recommend prosecution.  any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively manufacturing, marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in 2012, we received a warning letter from the fda citing concerns relating to certain processes pertaining to products manufactured at our ponce, puerto rico manufacturing facility.  in august 2018, we received a warning letter from the fda related to observed non-conformities with current good manufacturing practice requirements of the qsr at our warsaw north campus manufacturing facility.  as of february 14, 2020, these warning letters remained pending.  until the violations are corrected, we may become subject to additional regulatory action by the fda as described above, the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval applications and/or the fda may refuse to grant export certificates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  additional information regarding these and other fda regulatory matters can be found in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements.
governmental regulations outside the u.s. continue to become increasingly stringent and complex.  in the eu, for example, the mdr will become effective in may 2020 and will include significant additional premarket and post-market requirements.  complying with the requirements of this regulation requires us to incur significant expense.  additionally, the availability of eu notified body services certified to the new requirements is limited, which may delay the marketing approval for some of our products under the mdr.  any such delays, or any failure to meet the
16
requirements of the new regulation, could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements.
our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, such as the international standards organization.  if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our business could be harmed.
if we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse or data privacy and security laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
the sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that medical products companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny around the world.  our industry is subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including the false claims act, the anti-kickback statute, the stark law, the physician payments sunshine act, the food, drug, and cosmetic act and similar laws and regulations in the u.s. and around the world.  in addition, we are subject to various laws concerning anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters (including the fcpa), sales to countries or persons subject to economic sanctions and other matters affecting our international operations.  violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the u.s., exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including medicare, medicaid and veterans administration health programs.  these laws are administered by, among others, the doj, the oig-hhs, the sec, the ofac, the bureau of industry and security of the u.s. department of commerce and state attorneys general.
we are also subject to federal, state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal and protection of health-related and other personal information.  the fda has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical devices.  the fda and the dhs have also issued urgent safety communications regarding cybersecurity vulnerabilities of certain medical devices, which vulnerabilities may apply to some of our current or future devices.
in addition, certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy, security and breach notification regulations promulgated under hipaa.  hipaa governs the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information by hipaa "covered entities" and their "business associates."  covered entities are health plans, health care clearinghouses and health care providers that engage in specific types of electronic transactions.  a business associate is any person or entity (other than members of a covered entity's workforce) that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information.  hhs (through the office for civil rights) has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to compliance with hipaa regulations.  on december 12, 2018, the office for civil rights of hhs issued a request for information seeking input from the public on how the hipaa regulations could be modified to amend existing obligations relating to the processing of protected health information.  we will monitor this process and assess the impact of changes to the hipaa regulations to our business.
in addition to the fda guidance and hipaa regulations described above, a number of u.s. states have also enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal, and protection of personal information, such as social security numbers, medical and financial information and other information.  these laws and regulations may be more restrictive and not preempted by u.s. federal laws.  for example, several u.s. territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individuals, and at times regulators, the media or credit reporting agencies, if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of personal information.  other state laws include the ccpa, which was signed into law on june 28, 2018 and largely took effect on january 1, 2020.  the ccpa, among other things, contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about california residents and affords those individuals numerous rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information or share it with our business partners.  regulations from the california attorney general have not been finalized, and it is expected that additional amendments to the ccpa will be introduced.  meanwhile, over fifteen other states have considered privacy laws like the ccpa, and in october 2019, nevada enacted a similar but generally less restrictive privacy law.  we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws, which may impose substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigations and compliance, allow private class-action litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business.
outside of the u.s., data protection laws, including the gdpr and lgpd, also apply to some of our operations in the countries in which we provide services to our customers.  legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve.  the gdpr imposes, among other
17
things, data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer eu personal data, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances, and possible substantial fines for any violations (including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of 20 million euros or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year).  governmental authorities around the world have enacted similar types of legislative and regulatory requirements concerning data protection, and additional governments are considering similar legal frameworks.
the interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change, and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement compliance with any additional requirements.  failure to comply with u.s. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with previous mergers and acquisitions and may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations, and the phase-out, replacement or unavailability of libor and/or other interest rate benchmarks could adversely affect our indebtedness.
we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with previous mergers and acquisitions.  at december 31, 2019, our total indebtedness was $8.2 billion, as compared to $1.4 billion at december 31, 2014.  as of december 31, 2019, our debt service obligations, comprised of principal and interest (excluding leases and equipment notes), during the next 12 months are expected to be $1.7 billion.  as a result of the increase in our debt, demands on our cash resources have increased.  the increased level of debt could, among other things:
•   require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to the servicing and repayment of our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

•   limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

•   restrict our ability to make strategic acquisitions or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities;

•   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;

•   adversely affect our credit rating, with the result that the cost of servicing our indebtedness might increase and our ability to obtain surety bonds could be impaired;

•   adversely affect the market price of our common stock; and

•   limit our ability to apply proceeds from a future offering or asset sale to purposes other than the servicing and repayment of debt.

in addition, the interest rates applicable to certain of our debt obligations are based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to the london interbank offered rate ("libor"), euro interbank offered rate ("euribor") and/or tokyo interbank offered rate ("tibor").  any increase in interest rates applicable to our debt obligations would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  further, in july 2017, the u.k.'s financial conduct authority, which regulates libor, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021.  in response to concerns regarding the future of libor, the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the federal reserve bank of new york convened the alternative reference rates committee ("arrc") to identify alternatives to libor.  the arrc has recommended a benchmark replacement waterfall to assist issuers in continued capital market entry while safeguarding against libor's discontinuation.  the initial steps in the arrc's recommended provision reference variations of the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr").  at this time, it is not possible to predict whether sofr will attain market traction as a libor replacement.  additionally, it is uncertain if libor will cease to exist after calendar year 2021, or whether additional reforms to libor may be enacted, or whether alternative reference rates will gain market acceptance as a replacement for libor.  further, other central banks have convened working groups to determine replacements or reforms of other interest rate benchmarks, such as euribor, and it is expected, although not known, that a transition away from the use of certain of these other interest rate benchmarks will occur over the course of the next few years and alternative reference rates will be established.
18
certain of our debt obligations that are based on libor will mature before the end of 2021.  however, the revolving credit agreement that we entered into on november 1, 2019 (the "2019 credit agreement") has an initial maturity date of november 1, 2024.  in anticipation of libor's phase out, the 2019 credit agreement provides for alternative base rates as well as a transition mechanism for selecting a benchmark replacement rate for libor, with such benchmark replacement rate to be mutually agreed with the general administrative agent and our lenders.  there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement with our lenders on any such replacement benchmark before experiencing adverse effects due to changes in interest rates, if at all.  we will continue to monitor the situation and address the potential reference rate changes in future debt obligations that we may incur.  accordingly, the potential effect of the phase-out, replacement or unavailability of libor, or the unavailability of any other interest rate benchmark such as euribor or tibor, on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined.  further, the use of an alternative base rate or a benchmark replacement rate as a basis for calculating interest with respect to any outstanding variable rate indebtedness could lead to an increase in the interest we pay and a corresponding increase in our costs of capital or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect our information systems or data, including from data breaches, our business could be adversely affected.
we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure.  as a result of technology initiatives, recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities.  in addition, some of our products and services incorporate software or information technology that collects data regarding patients and patient therapy, and some products or software we provide to customers connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes.  we also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, and, as a result, we manage a number of third-party suppliers who may or could have access to our confidential information, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information of patients, employees and customers (collectively "confidential information").
our information systems, and those of third-party suppliers with whom we contract, require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information.  in addition, given their size and complexity, these systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party suppliers and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products, systems or confidential information.
like other large multi-national corporations, we have experienced instances of successful phishing attacks on our email systems and expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future. we also are subject to other cyber-attacks, including state-sponsored cyber-attacks, industrial espionage, insider threats, computer denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, ransomware and other malware, payment fraud or other cyber incidents.  our incident response efforts, business continuity procedures and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.  if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could:
•   lose existing customers;

•   have difficulty attracting new customers;

•   have problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing;

•   suffer outages or disruptions in our operations or supply chain;

•   have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud;

•   have disputes with customers, physicians, and other healthcare professionals;

•   have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed;

•   incur increased operating expenses;

•   be subject to issues with product functionality that may result in a loss of data, risk to patient safety, field actions and/or product recalls;

•   incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach; or

19
•   suffer other adverse consequences.

while we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will be successful.  we will continue to dedicate significant resources to protect against unauthorized access to our systems and work with government authorities to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents; however, cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated, frequent and adaptive. therefore, despite our efforts, we cannot assure that cyber-attacks or data breaches will not occur or that systems issues will not arise in the future.  any significant breakdown, intrusion, breach, interruption, corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.
our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors.
we operate in a highly competitive environment.  our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies, including biological therapies.  to remain competitive, we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies and improve existing products and technologies.  competition is primarily on the basis of:
•   technology;

•   innovation;

•   quality;

•   reputation;

•   customer service; and

•   pricing.

in markets outside of the u.s., other factors influence competition as well, including:
•   local distribution systems;

•   complex regulatory environments; and

•   differing medical philosophies and product preferences.

our competitors may:
•   have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us;

•   respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies;

•   undertake more extensive marketing campaigns;

•   adopt more aggressive pricing policies; or

•   be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.

any of these factors, alone or in combination, could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products.
if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.
our marketing success in the u.s. and abroad depends significantly upon our agents' and distributors' sales and service expertise in the marketplace.  many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents' detailed knowledge of products and instruments.  a loss of a significant number of our agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
20
if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline demand for our products may change, in certain cases, in ways we may not anticipate because of:
•   evolving customer needs;

•   changing demographics;

•   slowing industry growth rates;

•   declines in the musculoskeletal implant market;

•   the introduction of new products and technologies;

•   evolving surgical philosophies; and

•   evolving industry standards.

without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time.  if that happens, our revenue and operating results would suffer.  the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:
•   properly identify and anticipate customer needs;

•   commercialize new products in a timely manner;

•   manufacture and deliver instruments and products in sufficient volumes on time;

•   differentiate our offerings from competitors' offerings;

•   achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products;

•   satisfy the increased demands by healthcare payors, providers and patients for shorter hospital stays, faster post-operative recovery and lower-cost procedures;

•   innovate and develop new materials, product designs and surgical techniques; and

•   provide adequate medical education relating to new products.

in addition, new materials, product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly, in some or all markets, because of, among other factors:
•   entrenched patterns of clinical practice;

•   the need for regulatory clearance; and

•   uncertainty with respect to third-party reimbursement.

moreover, innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production.  in addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.
if third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels, the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed.
we sell our products and services to hospitals, doctors, dentists and other healthcare providers, all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from third-party payors, such as domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs.  these third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a product or service used in a procedure was not in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication.  third-party payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and products.
21
in addition, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services.  if third-party payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products, demand for our products may decline, or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets.  if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products, our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected.
the ongoing cost-containment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs.  group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization's affiliated hospitals and other members.  if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products, and, if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer's products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement.  our failure to respond to the cost-containment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the u.s., which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs.
we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived approximately 40 percent of our net sales in 2019 from outside the u.s.  we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally, including in emerging markets, which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations.  our international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including:
•   changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs;

•   changes in foreign regulatory requirements, such as more stringent requirements for regulatory clearance of products;

•   differing local product preferences and product requirements;

•   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•   diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the u.s.;

•   trade protection measures, import or export requirements, new or increased tariffs, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers, which may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and may increase our operating costs;

•   foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the u.s.;

•   complex data privacy requirements and labor relations laws;

•   extraterritorial effects of u.s. laws such as the fcpa;

•   effects of foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the uk bribery act;

•   difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;

•   labor force instability;

•   potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and

•   political, social and economic instability and uncertainty, including sovereign debt issues.

violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.
22
we have significant global sales and operations and face risks related to health epidemics that could impact our sales and operating results.
our business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus first identified in wuhan, hubei province, china.  any outbreak of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments, could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.  these could include disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel or to distribute our products, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers or customers, the deferral of elective procedures in impacted countries or the temporary suspension of operations by us or our suppliers or customers.  any disruption of our operations, or those of our suppliers or customers, would likely impact our sales and operating results.  in addition, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and likely impact our operating results.
we may have additional tax liabilities.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions.  significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.  in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.  we are regularly under audit by tax authorities.  although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was signed into law on december 22, 2017 (the "2017 tax act"), with significant changes to the u.s. corporate income tax system, including a federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent, limitations on the deductibility of interest expense, and the transition of u.s. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system.  our tax expense and cash flow could be impacted in the event of adverse future regulatory guidance provided by the u.s. treasury clarifying certain aspects of the 2017 tax act or other changes to the u.s. corporate income tax system.
other changes in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense.  for example, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the "base erosion and profit shifting" project undertaken by the organisation for economic co-operation and development ("oecd").  the oecd, which represents a coalition of member countries, has recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles.  these changes, as adopted by countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.
we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can increase our costs, cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks.
a substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in europe and japan.  the u.s. dollar value of our foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations.  significant increases in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the euro, the japanese yen, the swiss franc or other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities, and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial instruments, those actions may not prove to be fully effective or may create additional financial obligations for us.  further, if the counterparties to the derivative financial instrument transactions fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress or otherwise, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from those transactions.
pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation.
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices.  in the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients.  as discussed further in
23
note 20 to our consolidated financial statements, we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the durom® acetabular component ("durom cup"), certain products within the m/l taper and m/l taper with kinectiv® technology hip stems and versys® femoral head implants, and the m2a-magnumtm hip system.  we are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products.  any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, can be costly to defend.  product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.
we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights, and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.
claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our industry and are frequently time consuming and costly.  at any given time, we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  as discussed further in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements, in 2015 we paid a compensatory damages award of approximately $90 million and in march 2019 we paid approximately $168 million related to an award of treble damages and attorneys' fees in a patent infringement lawsuit.
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology, processes, methodologies and information.  we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and nondisclosure, license, assignment and confidentiality arrangements to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights, as well as the intellectual property rights of third parties whose assets we license.  however, the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights, and the rights of those from whom we license intellectual property, may not be adequate to prevent unauthorized use, misappropriation or theft of our intellectual property.  further, our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors, and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage.  third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.  we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information.
in addition, intellectual property laws differ in various jurisdictions in which we operate and are subject to change at any time, which could further restrict our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights.  in particular, a portion of our revenues is derived from jurisdictions where adequately protecting intellectual property rights may prove more challenging or impossible.  we may also not be able to detect unauthorized uses or take timely and effective steps to remedy unauthorized conduct.  to prevent or respond to unauthorized uses of our intellectual property, we might be required to engage in costly and time-consuming litigation or other proceedings and we may not ultimately prevail.  any failure to establish, maintain or protect our intellectual property or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
we are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.
in addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits, we are involved in various commercial and securities litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.  for example, as discussed further in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements, we are defending a purported class action lawsuit, shah v. zimmer biomet holdings, inc. et al., filed against us, certain of our current and former officers, certain current and former members of our board of directors, and certain former stockholders of ours who sold shares of our common stock in secondary public offerings in 2016, alleging that we and other defendants violated federal securities laws by making materially false and/or misleading statements and/or omissions about our compliance with fda regulations and our ability to continue to accelerate our organic revenue growth rate in the second half of 2016.  there have also been four shareholder derivative actions filed purportedly on our behalf against certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain former stockholders of ours who sold shares of our common stock in secondary public offerings in 2016, alleging breaches of fiduciary duties
24
and insider trading, based on substantially the same factual allegations as shah.  although we believe there are substantial defenses in these matters, litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.  given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome.  we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period.
future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results.
goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets.  at december 31, 2019, we had $9.6 billion in goodwill and $7.3 billion of intangible assets.  the goodwill results from our acquisition activity and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired.  we assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable.  as discussed further in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $975.9 million in 2018.  if the operating performance at one or more of our reporting units falls significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline, or as a result of restructuring initiatives pursuant to which we reorganize our reporting units, we could be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges.  any write-off of a material portion of our goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations.
developments relating to the uk's exit from the eu could adversely affect us.
the uk held a referendum in june 2016 in which voters chose to leave the eu, commonly referred to as "brexit".  following a protracted period of negotiation, the uk ceased to be a member of the eu on january 31, 2020, after the ratification and approval of a withdrawal agreement by the eu and the uk.  the withdrawal agreement provides for a transition period until december 31, 2020 (the "transition period"), during which the terms of the future trading relationship between the eu and the uk will be negotiated.  throughout the transition period, the legal and regulatory framework as between the uk and the eu will remain the same.
brexit and the perceptions as to its potential impact have and may continue to adversely affect business activity and economic conditions in europe and globally and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets both during and after the transition period.  brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services and people between the uk and the eu through the imposition of tariffs, custom inspections, and/or migration restrictions.  the future relationship for medical products regulation and trade between the uk and the eu is currently uncertain and any adjustments we make to our business and operations as a result of brexit could result in significant expense and take significant time to complete.  brexit could also result in the uk or the eu significantly altering its regulations affecting the clearance and approval of medical products.  in addition, as a result of brexit, other european countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to their continuing membership with the eu.  if there is no agreed upon long-term trading arrangement by the end of the transition period (a so-called "hard brexit"), it would likely have a significant adverse impact on labor and trade and create significant short-term currency volatility.
given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent to which we will be affected by brexit is uncertain.  any of the potential negative effects of brexit could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, our restated by-laws and the delaware general corporation law may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.
25
these provisions provide for, among other things:
•   the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without further stockholder action;

•   advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings;

•   certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings; and

•   the prohibition on engaging in a "business combination" with an "interested stockholder" for three years after the time at which a person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met, as set forth in section 203 of the delaware general corporation law.

these anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party's offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders.  as a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.
our restated by-laws designate certain delaware courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.
our restated by-laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, a state court located within the state of delaware (or, if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the district of delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including any beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated by-laws, as either may be amended from time to time, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine.  any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions.  this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees.  alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.  certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes.  certain amounts in the 2018 and 2017 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation.  the following discussion, analysis and comparisons generally focus on the operating results for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018.  discussion, analysis and comparisons of the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this form 10-k can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018.
executive level overview
2019 financial highlights in 2019, our net sales increased by 0.6 percent compared to 2018.  we estimate changes in volume/mix of our products and pricing had a positive effect of 2.2 percent on our 2019 sales while changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative effect of 1.6 percent.  notably, our sales growth was higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year primarily due to various product launches in our knees product category, which drove improved commercial execution.  the improved second half performance was present in all of our product categories and geographic regions.  additionally, the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was less in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half.
our net earnings increased by more than $1.5 billion in 2019 from 2018.  we had significant goodwill and intangible asset impairments and litigation-related charges in 2018, which contributed to a net loss that year.  in 2019, expenses related to quality remediation, as well as acquisition and integration, declined due to the continued progress in completing those projects.  higher sales, lower interest expense and the recognition of a deferred tax benefit related to switzerland tax reform resulted in the significant increase in earnings in 2019 compared to 2018.
2020 outlook we believe that the improved sales performance in the second half of 2019 will continue into 2020.  we estimate sales growth in 2020 compared to 2019 will be in a range of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent.  we anticipate the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates will be minimal for 2020.  we expect to be able to leverage the sales growth into higher operating profits.  additionally, we expect reductions in quality remediation costs, as well as other various project costs, as we complete these initiatives.  we have recently initiated restructuring activities designed to reduce our operating costs in the long-term.  these activities are expected to result in expenses of approximately $350 million to $400 million through the end of 2023, with slightly more than half of that expected to be incurred in 2020.   further, we expect interest expense, net, will continue to decline in 2020 due to lower average outstanding debt balances.
our 2020 outlook does not consider any impacts from the recent outbreak of the coronavirus.  while there could be a near-term effect on our operating results, it is difficult to assess or predict how material the impact will be and what long-term effects the outbreak may have.
results of operations we analyze sales by three geographies, the americas, emea and asia pacific, and by the following product categories: knees, hips, s.e.t., dental, spine & cmf and other.  this sales analysis differs from our reportable operating segments, which are based upon our senior management organizational structure and how we allocate resources towards achieving operating profit goals.  we analyze sales by geography because the underlying market trends in any particular geography tend to be similar across product categories and because we primarily sell the same products in all geographies.

demand (volume/mix) trends increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales had a positive effect of 4.9 percent on year-over-year sales during 2019.  volume/mix growth was driven by recent product introductions, particularly in our knees product category, sales in key emerging markets and market growth.  market growth has generally been influenced by an aging global population, obesity, new technologies, advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles, among other factors.   pricing trends global selling prices had a negative effect of 2.7 percent on year-over-year sales during 2019.  in the majority of countries in which we operate, we continue to experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems.
foreign currency exchange rates in 2019, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative effect of 1.6 percent on year-over-year sales.  if foreign currency exchange rates remain at levels consistent with recent rates, we estimate they will have a minimal effect on sales in 2020 for the full year.  however, we estimate sales will be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates in the first half of the year, but that impact will be offset by positive effects in the second half of the year.
sales by product category knees knee sales increased by 1.3 percent in 2019 compared to 2018.  various product launches resulted in improved volume/mix growth in the knee product category, which was partially offset by price declines and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  knee sales growth was principally driven by increased demand for persona® the personalized knee system, the oxford® partial knee and the rosa® knee system.
hips hip sales increased by 0.7 percent in 2019 compared to 2018.  volume/mix growth in this product category was partially offset by price declines and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  hip sales growth was primarily attributable to increased utilization of our taperloc® complete hip system and g7® acetabular system.
s.e.t.
s.e.t. sales increased by 2.5 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to supply stability, salesforce specialization and new product launches, partially offset by price declines and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

spine & cmf spine and cmf sales decreased by 2.2 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to ongoing sales channel consolidation in our spine division, price declines and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  demand for our thoracic products continued to positively contribute to sales.
dental dental sales increased by 0.7 percent in 2019 compared to 2018.  volume/mix growth in our dental product category improved primarily due to investment of resources in priority areas, as well as other operational improvements.

cost of products sold and intangible asset amortization we calculate gross profit as net sales minus cost of products sold and intangible asset amortization.  our gross margin percentage is gross profit divided by net sales.  the following table sets forth the factors that contributed to the gross margin changes in each of 2019 and 2018 compared to the prior year:

the increase in gross margin percentage in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the effect of our hedging program, lower royalty expense, a refund related to u.s. medical device excise taxes and lower intangible asset amortization.  we incurred hedge gains of $38.4 million in 2019 compared to hedge losses of $26.2 million in 2018.  for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged items affect earnings.  the refund of a portion of the u.s. medical device excise tax was the result of a change in the methodology we used to calculate the constructive sales price upon which the taxes were paid.  on july 1, 2019 the irs approved and agreed to our change in methodology.  the reduction in royalty expense was partially the result of an agreement we entered into on april 1, 2019.  under the agreement, we paid $192.5 million to buy out certain licensing arrangements from an unrelated third party.  this new agreement and the related payment replace the variable royalty payments that otherwise would have been due under the terms of previous licensing arrangements through 2029.  the payment was recorded as an intangible asset and will be amortized through 2029.  intangible asset amortization expense declined in 2019 due to certain intangible assets from past acquisitions being fully amortized, partially offset by additional amortization from the agreement to buy out certain licensing arrangements we entered into on april 1, 2019.  these favorable items were partially offset by lower average selling prices and higher manufacturing costs.
operating expenses r&d expenses as a percentage of net sales increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increased investment in our knee product pipeline, costs associated with the eu mdr and patent licenses acquired for use in r&d activities that were expensed immediately.
selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses and sg&a expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower litigation-related charges.  in 2018, we recognized a $168 million litigation charge for a patent infringement lawsuit.  the lower litigation-related charges were partially offset by higher selling costs due to higher sales, investments in preparation for new product launches, and higher expenses from legal entity, distribution and manufacturing optimization, including distributor contract terminations.
in 2019, we recognized a $70.1 million in-process research and development ("ipr&d") intangible asset impairment on certain ipr&d projects that we terminated.  in 2018, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $975.9 million primarily related to our emea and spine reporting units.
our quality remediation expenses continued to decline in 2019 due to the natural regression of completing our remediation milestones.  similarly, acquisition, integration and related expenses declined mainly due to the completion of certain integration efforts.
in december 2019, our board of directors approved, and we initiated, a new global restructuring program with an overall objective of reducing costs to allow us to invest in higher priority growth opportunities.  we recognized expenses of $50.0 million in 2019 primarily related to severance associated with this program as well as expenses
34
incurred related to a supply chain optimization initiative.  the 2018 cost reduction expenses only included expenses related to the supply chain optimization initiative.
other expense, net, interest expense, net, and income taxes our other expense, net, primarily relates to certain components of pension expense, investment gains and losses and remeasurement gains and losses related to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than an entity's functional currency, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency forward exchange contracts we entered into to mitigate any gain or loss.  the decline in other expense, net in 2019 was driven by higher pension-related gains.
interest expense, net, declined in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to continued debt repayments and gains related to our cross-currency interest rate swaps.
our effective tax rate ("etr") on earnings (loss) before income taxes was negative 24.9 percent (a tax benefit was recognized on earnings before income taxes) and negative 39.9 percent (a tax provision was recognized on a loss before income taxes) for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  in 2019, we recognized an overall tax benefit in the year due to a $315.0 million benefit from switzerland's federal act on tax reform and ahv financing ("traf") in addition to the tax impact of certain restructuring transactions in switzerland.  the traf is effective january 1, 2020 and includes the abolishment of various favorable federal and cantonal tax regimes.  the traf provides transitional relief measures for companies that are losing the tax benefit of a ruling, including a "step-up" for amortizable goodwill, equal to the amount of future tax benefit they would have received under their existing ruling, subject to certain limitations.
in 2018, our negative etr was primarily due to goodwill impairment that resulted in us having a net loss before income taxes with no associated tax benefit recognized for this charge.  in 2018, we also recognized an additional $8.3 million of income tax provision as we completed our estimate of the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 ("2017 tax act").
absent discrete tax events, we expect our future etr will be lower than the u.s. corporate income tax rate of 21.0 percent due to our mix of earnings between u.s. and foreign locations, which have lower corporate income tax rates.  our etr in future periods could also potentially be impacted by: changes in our mix of pre-tax earnings; changes in tax rates, tax laws or their interpretation, including the european union rules on state aid; the outcome of various federal, state and foreign audits; and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.  currently, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of these items on our financial results.

non-gaap operating performance measures we use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") to evaluate our operating performance.  these non-gaap financial
35
measures exclude, as applicable, the impact of inventory step-up; certain inventory and manufacturing-related charges including charges to discontinue certain product lines; intangible asset amortization; goodwill and intangible asset impairment; quality remediation expenses; restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives; acquisition, integration and related expenses;  certain litigation gains and charges; expenses to comply with the eu mdr; other charges; any related effects on our income tax provision associated with these items; the effect of switzerland tax reform; the effect of the 2017 tax act; other certain tax adjustments; and, with respect to earnings per share information, provide for the effect of dilutive shares assuming net earnings in a period of a reported net loss.  we use these non-gaap financial measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business.  additionally, we believe these non-gaap measures provide meaningful incremental information to investors to consider when evaluating our performance.  we believe these measures offer the ability to make period-to-period comparisons that are not impacted by certain items that can cause dramatic changes in reported income but that do not impact the fundamentals of our operations.  the non-gaap measures enable the evaluation of operating results and trend analysis by allowing a reader to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items that are excluded from the non-gaap measures.  in addition, adjusted diluted earnings per share is used as a performance metric in our incentive compensation programs.
our non-gaap adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $1,626.4 million, $1,565.4 million and $1,636.4 million, respectively, and our non-gaap adjusted diluted earnings per share were $7.87, $7.64 and $8.03, respectively.

(1)   inventory step-up and other inventory and manufacturing-related charges relate to inventory step-up expense, excess and obsolete inventory charges on certain product lines we intend to discontinue and other inventory and manufacturing-related charges. the year ended december 31, 2019 included a $20.8 million charge incurred to terminate a raw material supply agreement. inventory step-up expense represents the incremental expense of inventory sold recognized at its fair value after business combination accounting is applied versus the expense that would have been recognized if sold at its cost to manufacture. since only the inventory that existed at the business combination date was stepped-up to fair value, we believe excluding the incremental expense provides investors useful information as to what our costs may have been if we had not been required to increase the inventory's book value to fair value. the excess and obsolete inventory charges on certain product lines are driven by acquisitions where there are competing product lines and we have plans to discontinue one of the competing product lines.

(2)   we exclude intangible asset amortization from our non-gaap financial measures because we internally assess our performance against our peers without this amortization. due to various levels of acquisitions among our peers, intangible asset amortization can vary significantly from company to company.

(3)   in 2019 and 2018, we recognized $70.1 and $3.8 million, respectively, of intangible asset impairments from merger-related ipr&amp;d intangible assets. also in 2018, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $975.9 million. the impairment was comprised of $401.2 million in our spine reporting unit, $567.0 million in our emea reporting unit and $7.7 million in an insignificant reporting unit. in 2017, we recognized $18.8 million and $8.0 million of intangible asset impairment from merger-related ipr&amp;d and trademark intangible assets, respectively. also in 2017, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $32.7 million and $272.0 million on our office based technologies and spine reporting units, respectively.

(4)   we are addressing inspectional observations on form 483 and a warning letter issued by the u.s. food and drug administration ("fda") following its previous inspections of our warsaw north campus facility, among other matters. this quality remediation has required us to devote significant financial resources and is for a discrete period of time. the majority of the expenses are related to consultants who are helping us to update previous documents and redesign certain processes.

(5)   in december 2019, our board of directors approved, and we initiated, a new global restructuring program with an overall objective of reducing costs to allow us to invest in higher priority growth opportunities. in 2019, the expenses were primarily related to severance and our supply chain optimization initiative. the 2018 and 2017 expenses were related to our supply chain optimization initiative.

(6)   the acquisition, integration and related gains and expenses we have excluded from our non-gaap financial measures resulted from various acquisitions. the acquisition, integration and related gains and expenses include the following types of gains and expenses:

•   consulting and professional fees related to third-party integration consulting performed in a variety of areas, such as tax, compliance, logistics and human resources, and legal fees related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions.

37
•   employee termination benefits related to terminating employees with overlapping responsibilities in various areas of our business.

•   dedicated project personnel expenses which include the salary, benefits, travel expenses and other costs directly associated with employees who are 100 percent dedicated to our integration of acquired businesses and employees who have been notified of termination, but are continuing to work on transferring their responsibilities.

•   contract termination expenses related to terminated contracts, primarily with sales agents and distribution agreements.

•   other various expenses to relocate facilities, integrate information technology, losses incurred on assets resulting from the applicable acquisition, and other various expenses.

(7)   we are involved in routine patent litigation, product liability litigation, commercial litigation and other various litigation matters. we review litigation matters from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective to determine if excluding the losses or gains will provide our investors with useful incremental information. litigation matters can vary in their characteristics, frequency and significance to our operating results. the litigation charges and gains excluded from our non-gaap financial measures in the periods presented relate to product liability matters where we have received numerous claims on specific products, patent litigation and commercial litigation related to a common matter in multiple jurisdictions. in regards to the product liability matters, due to the complexities involved and claims filed in multiple districts, the expenses associated with these matters are significant to our operating results. once the litigation matter has been excluded from our non-gaap financial measures in a particular period, any additional expenses or gains from changes in estimates are also excluded, even if they are not significant, to ensure consistency in our non-gaap financial measures from period-to-period.

(8)   in the first quarter of 2019, we settled a patent infringement lawsuit out of court, and the other party agreed to pay us an upfront, lump-sum amount for a non-exclusive license to the patent.

(9)   the eu mdr imposes significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements. the new regulations provide a transition period until may 2020 for currently-approved medical devices to meet the additional requirements. for certain devices, this transition period can be extended until may 2024. we are excluding from our non-gaap financial measures the incremental costs incurred to establish initial compliance with the regulations related to our currently-approved medical devices. the incremental costs primarily include third-party consulting necessary to supplement our internal resources.

(10)   we have incurred other various expenses from specific events or projects that we consider highly variable or that have a significant impact to our operating results that we have excluded from our non-gaap measures. these include costs related to legal entity, distribution and manufacturing optimization, including contract terminations, as well as our costs of complying with our deferred prosecution agreement ("dpa") with the u.s. government related to certain foreign corrupt practices act matters involving biomet and certain of its subsidiaries. under the dpa, which has a three-year term, we are subject to oversight by an independent compliance monitor, which monitorship commenced in august 2017. the excluded costs include the fees paid to the independent compliance monitor and to external legal counsel assisting in the matter.

(11)   represents the tax effects on the previously specified items. the tax effect for the u.s. jurisdiction is calculated based on an effective rate considering federal and state taxes, as well as permanent items. for jurisdictions outside the u.s., the tax effect is calculated based upon the statutory rates where the items were incurred.

(12)   the 2017 tax act resulted in a net favorable provisional adjustment due to the reduction of deferred tax liabilities for unremitted earnings and revaluation of deferred tax liabilities to a 21 percent rate, which was partially offset by provisional tax charges related to the toll charge provision of the 2017 tax act. in 2018, we finalized our estimates of the effects of the 2017 tax act based upon final guidance issued by u.s. tax authorities.

(13)   we recognized a tax benefit related to traf in addition to an impact from certain restructuring transactions in switzerland.

(14)   other certain tax adjustments relate to various discrete tax period adjustments, including changes in statutory tax rates, adjustments from internal restructuring transactions that provide us access to offshore funds in a tax efficient manner and resolutions of various tax matters.

cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,585.8 million in 2019 compared to $1,747.4 million and $1,582.3 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.  the decrease in operating cash flows in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a payment of approximately $168 million on a patent infringement lawsuit.  additionally, in 2018 we expanded our sale of accounts receivable in certain countries which provided additional cash inflows, compared to 2019 when we sold fewer receivables at the end of the year which had a negative effect on operating cash flows.
cash flows used in investing activities were $729.3 million in 2019 compared to $416.6 million and $510.8 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.  in 2019, we paid $197.6 million to buy out certain licensing arrangements from unrelated third parties.  instrument and property, plant and equipment additions reflected ongoing investments in our product portfolio and optimization of our manufacturing and logistics network, including investments in instruments in 2019 to support new product launches.
cash flows used in financing activities were $779.9 million in 2019.  our primary use of available cash in 2019 was for debt repayment.  we received net proceeds of $549.2 million from the issuance of additional euro-denominated senior notes which we used to repay $500.0 million of senior notes that became due on november 30, 2019.  in january 2019, we borrowed an additional $200.0 million under a u.s. term loan ("u.s. term loan c") and used those proceeds, along with cash on hand, to repay the remaining $225.0 million outstanding under the u.s. term loan ("u.s. term loan b") provided for under our 2016 credit agreement.  during 2019 we also repaid the $735.0 million outstanding balance under u.s. term loan c, with the remainder of the proceeds from the euro-denominated senior notes issuance and cash from operations.  overall, we had approximately $710 million of net principal repayments on our senior notes and term loans in 2019.  in 2018, we received net proceeds of $749.5 million from the issuance of additional senior notes and borrowed $400.0 million from our $1.5 billion multicurrency revolving facility provided for under our 2016 credit agreement (the "2016 multicurrency revolving facility") to repay $1,150.0 million of senior notes that became due on april 2, 2018.  we subsequently repaid the $400.0 million of 2016 multicurrency revolving facility borrowings in 2018.  also in 2018, we borrowed $675.0 million under u.s. term loan c and used the cash proceeds along with cash generated from operations throughout the year to repay an aggregate of $835.0 million on u.s. term loan a, $450.0 million on u.s. term loan b, and we subsequently repaid $140.0 million on u.s. term loan c.  overall, we had approximately $1,150 million of net principal repayments on our senior notes and term loans in 2018.
in february, may, august and december 2019, our board of directors declared cash dividends of $0.24 per share.  we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.
in february 2016, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program effective march 1, 2016, with no expiration date.  as of december 31, 2019, all $1.0 billion remained authorized for repurchase under the program.
we will continue to exercise disciplined capital allocation designed to drive stockholder value creation.  we intend to use available cash for debt repayment, reinvestment in the business and payment of dividends.  if the right opportunities arise, we may also use available cash to pursue business development opportunities.
as discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, in december 2019, our board of directors approved, and we initiated, a new global restructuring program with an objective of reducing costs to allow us to further invest in higher priority growth opportunities.  the restructuring program is expected to result in total pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $350 million to $400 million, with slightly more than half of that expected to be incurred in 2020.  we expect to reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $200 million to $300 million by the end of 2023 as program benefits are realized.
as discussed in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements, the internal revenue service ("irs") has issued proposed adjustments for years 2005 through 2012 reallocating profits between certain of our u.s. and foreign subsidiaries.  we have disputed these proposed adjustments and continue to pursue resolution with the irs.  although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain, future payments may be significant to our operating cash flows.
as discussed in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements, as of december 31, 2019, we have an estimated liability of $59.9 million related to durom cup product liability claims and a liability of $50.1 million related to biomet metal-on-metal hip implant claims on our consolidated balance sheet.  we expect to continue paying these claims over the next few years.

we have a five-year unsecured multicurrency revolving facility of $1.5 billion (the "2019 multicurrency revolving facility") that will mature on november 1, 2024.  there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility as of december 31, 2019.  the 2019 multicurrency revolving facility replaced the 2016 multicurrency revolving facility, effective november 1, 2019.  we also had other available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $45.3 million as of december 31, 2019.
we have $1.5 billion principal amount of notes due april 1, 2020.  we believe we can satisfy this debt obligation with cash generated from our operations, by issuing new debt, and/or by borrowing on our 2019 multicurrency revolving facility.  we believe that our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if necessary, to satisfy this debt obligation.
for additional information on our debt, see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
we place our cash and cash equivalents in highly-rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity.  we invest only in high-quality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy.
as of december 31, 2019, $373.4 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held in jurisdictions outside of the u.s.  of this amount, $102.1 million is denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, bears no foreign currency translation risk.  the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate.  in the future, we intend to repatriate at least $5.0 billion of unremitted earnings, of which the additional tax related to remitting earnings is deemed immaterial.
management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the 2019 multicurrency revolving facility are sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs, as well as return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.  should additional investment opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if necessary.

$118.6 million of the other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet as of december 31, 2019 are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans.  defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans; they are not based upon future contributions.  due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions, we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2020.  therefore, this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans.  see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans.
under the 2017 tax act, we have a $234.9 million toll charge liability for the one-time deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. this amount was recorded in non-current income tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2019.  we have elected to pay the toll charge in installments over eight years.
also included in long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon.  due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities, such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made.  therefore, this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits.  see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these tax-related accounts.
we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product r&d milestones, sales milestones, or, at our discretion, maintenance of exclusive rights to distribute a product.  since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made, we have not included them in this table.  these payments could range from $0 to $60 million.
critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods.  significant accounting policies which require management's judgment are discussed below.
excess inventory and instruments - we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost.  similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply.  accordingly, inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value.  to determine the appropriate net realizable value, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components.  the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work‐in‐process inventory, which is recorded at cost.  obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off.  management evaluates the need for changes to the net realizable values of inventory and instruments based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis.
income taxes - our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid.  we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.

we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction.  realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits.  we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is "more likely than not" that the deferred tax benefit will be realized.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations.  we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances, including existing tax laws, our experience with previous settlement agreements, the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters.
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available.  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.  these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
commitments and contingencies - accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported.  we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims.  historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model.
goodwill and intangible assets - we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets and risk-adjusted discount rates.  as such, these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs.  changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets.
in our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2019, we estimated the fair value of our emea and dental reporting units only exceeded their carrying values by less than 5 percent.  fair value was determined using income and market approaches.  fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting units.  significant assumptions are incorporated into the income approach, such as estimated growth rates and risk-adjusted discount rates.  fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology, which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to our emea and dental reporting units.  as of december 31, 2019, the remaining goodwill on the emea and dental reporting units were $749.8 million and $397.7 million, respectively.
future impairment in the emea and dental reporting units could occur if the estimates used in the income and market approaches change.  if our estimates of profitability in the reporting unit decline, the fair value estimate under the income approach will decline.  additionally, changes in the broader economic environment could cause changes to our estimated discount rates, foreign currency exchange rates used to translate cash flows and comparable company valuation indicators, which may impact our estimated fair values.
we have three other reporting units that have goodwill assigned to them.  the fair value of each of these three reporting units is sufficiently in excess of its carrying value which leads us to believe only a significant, unforeseen event could cause impairment to any of these reporting units.

item 1a. risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10-k, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.
risks associated with capital markets, credit markets, and real estate volatility in capital and credit markets, or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, either nationally or regionally in one or more of the markets in which we operate, could adversely impact us.
the capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption. we therefore may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all, which would adversely affect our liquidity, our ability to make distributions to shareholders, acquire assets and continue our development activities. other weakened economic conditions, including job losses, high unemployment levels, stock market volatility, and uncertainty about the future, could adversely affect rental rates and occupancy levels. unfavorable changes in economic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results.
additional key economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following:
•   local conditions, such as an oversupply of apartments or other housing available for rent, or a reduction in demand for apartments in the area;
•   declines in the financial condition of our residents, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some residents;
•   declines in market rental rates;
•   low mortgage interest rates and home pricing, making alternative housing more affordable;
•   government or builder incentives which enable home buyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing options more attractive;
•   regional economic downturns, including, but not limited to, business layoffs, downsizing and increased unemployment, which may impact one or more of our geographical markets; and
•   increased operating costs, if these costs cannot be passed through to our residents.
short-term leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents.
our apartment leases are generally for a term of fifteen months or less. as these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms.
competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income.
there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents. our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties, condominiums, single-family homes, third-party providers of short-term rentals and serviced apartments, which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located. this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property, as well as on the rents realized.
we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities.
we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings. the risks inherent in purchasing, owning, and developing land increase as demand for apartments, or rental rates, decrease. real estate markets are highly uncertain and, as a result, the value of undeveloped land may fluctuate significantly. in addition, carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability. as a result, we hold certain land, and may in the future acquire additional land, in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which may preclude us from developing a profitable multifamily community. if there are subsequent changes in the fair market value of our land holdings which we determine is less than the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell, we may be required to take future impairment charges which would reduce our net income.
risks associated with our operations development, redevelopment and construction risks could impact our profitability.
we intend to continue to develop, redevelop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our portfolio. in 2020, we expect to incur costs between approximately $220 million and $240 million related to the construction of seven consolidated projects. additionally, during 2020, we expect to incur costs between approximately $65 million and $75 million related to the start of new development activities, between approximately $52 million and $56 million related to repositions and revenue enhancing expenditures of existing properties and between approximately $16 million and $20 million in extensive redevelopment expenditures of existing properties. our development, redevelopment and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks which may increase our construction costs and decrease our profitability, including the following:
•   inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other required permits and authorizations;
•   increased materials and labor costs, problems with contractors or subcontractors, or other costs including those costs due to errors and omissions which occur in the design or construction process;
•   inability to obtain financing with favorable terms;
•   inability to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule;
•   forecasted occupancy and rental rates may differ from the actual results; and
•   the incurrence of costs related to the abandonment of development opportunities which we have pursued and subsequently deemed unfeasible.
our inability to successfully implement our development, redevelopment and construction strategy could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders.
one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is engaged in the business of providing general contracting services under construction contracts entered into between it and third parties (which may include our nonconsolidated affiliates). the terms of those construction contracts generally require this subsidiary to estimate the time and costs to complete a project to calculate the cost plus margin for the project fee, but not to exceed a maximum amount, and to assume the risk when these estimates may be greater than anticipated. as a result, profitability on those contracts is dependent on the ability to accurately predict such factors. the time and costs necessary to complete a project may be affected by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, those listed above, many of which are beyond this subsidiary's control. in addition, the terms of those contracts generally require this subsidiary to warrant its work for a period of time during which it may be required to repair, replace, or rebuild non-conforming work. further, trailing liabilities, based on various legal theories such as claims of negligent construction, may result from such projects, and these trailing liabilities may go on for a number of years depending on the length of the statute of repose in the applicable jurisdictions.
investments through joint ventures and investment funds involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor.
we have invested and may continue to invest as a joint venture partner in joint ventures. these investments involve risks, including, but not limited to, the possibility the other joint venture partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours, possess the ability to take or force action or withhold consent contrary to our requests, or become insolvent and require us to assume and fulfill the joint venture's financial obligations. we and our joint venture partners may each have the right to initiate a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire a joint venture partner's interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction. each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate, finance, or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the applicable joint venture agreement. we account for three investment funds (collectively, the "funds") utilizing the equity method of accounting. as of december 31, 2019, we had two discretionary investment funds, and in march 2015, we completed the formation of a third fund with an unaffiliated third party which did not own any properties in 2019, 2018, or 2017. the risks associated with our funds, which we manage as the general partner and advisor, include, but are not limited to, the following:
•   one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner of the funds and has unlimited liability for the third-party debts, obligations, and liabilities of the funds pursuant to partnership law;
•   investors in the funds (other than us), by majority vote, may remove our subsidiary as the general partner of the funds with or without cause and the funds' advisory boards, by a majority vote of their members, may remove our subsidiary as the general partner of the funds at any time for cause;
•   while we have broad discretion to manage the funds and make investment decisions on behalf of the funds, the investors or the funds' advisory boards must approve certain matters, and as a result we may be unable to make certain investments or implement certain decisions on behalf of the funds which we consider beneficial;
•   our ability to dispose of all or a portion of our investments in the funds is subject to significant restrictions; and
•   we may be liable if the funds fail to comply with various tax or other regulatory matters.
competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties.
we expect other real estate investors will compete with us to acquire additional operating properties. this competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or achieve the expected profitability of such properties upon acquisition.
our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected.
we may acquire additional operating properties on a selective basis. our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the following:
•   we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired properties into our existing operations;
•   our estimates of the costs, if any, of repositioning or redeveloping the acquired property may prove inaccurate;
•   the expected occupancy, rental rates and operating expenses may differ from the actual results;
•   we may not be able to obtain adequate financing; and
•   we may not be able to identify suitable candidates on terms acceptable to us and may not achieve expected returns or other benefits as a result of integration challenges, such as personnel and technology.
changes in rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations could adversely affect our operations and property values.
certain states and local municipalities have recently adopted rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations, imposing restrictions on amounts of rent increases which may be charged based solely on market conditions.  there are a number of additional states and local municipalities in which we operate also considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider imposing rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations.  such laws and regulations could limit our ability to increase rents, charge certain fees, evict residents, or recover increases in our operating expenses and could make it more difficult to dispose of properties in certain circumstances. the terms of laws and regulations recently enacted, future laws and regulations which may be enacted, as well as any lawsuits against the company arising from such issues, could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and could reduce the value of our operating properties.
failure to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences.
we may not continue to qualify as a reit in the future. also, the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years. if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we may be subject to federal and state income taxes for such year. in addition, we may not be able to requalify as a reit for the four subsequent taxable years and may be subject to federal and state income taxes in those years as well. this may also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital which may adversely affect the value of our common shares.
we may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow. these potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property values at either the corporate or individual property levels. any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for cash distributions to our common shareholders and non-controlling interest holders. additionally, in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90% of our adjusted taxable income.
tax laws have recently changed and may continue to change at any time, and any such legislative or other actions could have a negative effect on us.
tax laws remain under constant review by persons involved in the legislative process, at the internal revenue service, the u.s. department of treasury, and by various state and local tax authorities. future changes in tax laws, including to administrative interpretations, enacted tax rates, or new pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect us in a number of ways, including making it more difficult or more costly for us to qualify as a reit.
litigation risks could affect our business.
as an owner, manager and developer of multifamily properties, we may incur liability based on various conditions at our properties and the buildings thereon, and we also have become and in the future may become involved in legal proceedings, including consumer, employment, tort or commercial litigation, which if decided adversely to or settled by us, and not adequately covered by insurance, could result in liability which is material to our financial condition or results of operations.
damage from catastrophic weather and other natural events could result in losses.
a certain number of our properties are located in areas which have experienced and may in the future experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time, including fires, snow or ice storms, windstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding or other severe weather, or other environmental events. these adverse weather or natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed our insurance coverage. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected property, anticipated future revenue from the property, and could also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the implementation of future enhancements to our new enterprise resource planning system could interfere with our business and operations.
we have completed the first phase of a multi-year implementation of an enterprise resource planning (erp) system which replaced our previous financial accounting system. this erp system maintains our books and records, records transactions, and provides important information relating to the operations of our business to our management. the implementation of this erp system has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant personnel and financial resources. while we have invested, and will continue to invest, significant resources in planning and project management, issues may arise during the implementation of future enhancements which may result in operational or financial reporting delays, increased costs or other difficulties not presently contemplated.  any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of future enhancements to the erp system could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
a cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively impact our business.
we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations, including internet and cloud-based systems and applications. we also use mobile devices, social networking, outside vendors and other online activities to connect with our employees, suppliers and residents. such uses and the on-going advancement in technology give rise to potential cybersecurity risks with increasing sophistication, including but not limited to, security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of confidential information. our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and confidential information and intellectual property, including residents' and suppliers' personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about us. further, as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and developments and to pursue new initiatives to improve our operations, we are also expanding our information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with our operations, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks and may be liable for the consequential litigation and remediation costs. additionally, the measures we have implemented to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents may not be effective and there can be no complete assurance of prevention or anticipation of such incidents. the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive data, confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of residents, potential liability and competitive disadvantage, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
our third-party service providers are primarily responsible for the security of their own information technology environments and in certain instances, we rely significantly on third-party service providers to supply and store our sensitive data in a secure manner. all of these third parties face potential risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours which could disrupt their businesses and therefore adversely impact us. while we provide guidance and specific requirements in some cases, we do not directly control any of these parties' information technology security operations, or the amount of investment they place in guarding against cybersecurity threats. accordingly, we are subject to any flaws in or breaches to their information technology systems or those which they operate for us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
risks associated with our indebtedness and financing we have significant debt, which could have adverse consequences.
as of december 31, 2019, we had outstanding debt of approximately $2.5 billion. this indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:
•   our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions is increased; and
•   our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in business and industry conditions is limited.
our unsecured credit facility and the indenture under which our unsecured debt was issued contain customary restrictions, requirements, and other limitations, as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios. maintaining compliance with these provisions could limit our financial flexibility. a default in these provisions, if uncured, could require us to repay the indebtedness before the scheduled maturity date, which could adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs.
insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders.
substantially all of our income is derived from rental and other income from our multifamily communities. as a result, our performance depends in large part on our ability to collect rent from residents, which could be negatively affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:
•   delay in resident lease commencements;
•   decline in occupancy;
•   failure of residents to make rental payments when due;
•   the attractiveness of our properties to residents and potential residents;
•   our ability to adequately manage and maintain our communities;
•   competition from other available apartments and housing alternatives;
•   changes in market rents;
•   increases in operating expenses; and
•   changes in governmental regulations such as rent control or stabilization laws regulating rental housing.
cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing. in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90% of our adjusted taxable income. this requirement limits the cash available to meet required principal payments on our debt.
issuances of additional debt may adversely impact our financial condition.
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including the rental and occupancy rates of our multifamily properties, minimum dividend requirements to our equity holders, development, redevelopment and other capital expenditures, costs of operations, and potential acquisitions. if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans, we may require additional financing earlier than anticipated. if we issue more debt, we could become more leveraged, resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements, both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future.
we may be unable to renew, repay, or refinance our outstanding debt.
we are subject to the risk our unsecured indebtedness will not be renewed, repaid, or refinanced when due or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness. if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses to us. such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to pay amounts due on our debt and make distributions to our shareholders.
we may be adversely affected by changes in libor reporting practices or the method in which libor is determined.
our unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loan are indexed to the london interbank offered rate ("libor"). it is unclear whether libor will continue to be calculated or published as a reference rate/benchmark after 2021. to address the potential for libor's cessation, the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york (frbny), in coordination with multiple other regulators and large industry participants, convened the alternative reference rates committee ("arrc"). the arrc has identified the secured overnight financing rate (sofr) as the preferred successor rate for libor. we are closely monitoring the progress of the phase-out of libor and incorporating relatively standardized fallback language into our libor-indexed debt documents for transitioning to an alternative index (which is defined to be the index that becomes generally used by lenders and other market participants) and a spread adjustment mechanism to prevent lenders from receiving a lower rate upon transition. there is significant uncertainty with respect to how the phase-out will be implemented and what alternative index will be adopted, which will ultimately be determined by the market as a whole. it therefore remains uncertain how such changes will be implemented and the effects such changes would have on us and the financial markets generally. these changes may have a material adverse impact on the availability of financing and on our financing costs.
rising interest rates could both increase our borrowing costs, thereby adversely affecting our cash flows and the amounts available for distribution to our shareholders, and decrease our share price, if investors seek higher yields through other investments.
we have an unsecured credit facility and an unsecured term loan bearing interest at variable rates on all amounts drawn. we may incur mortgage debt or other additional variable rate debt in the future. increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense, unless we make arrangements which hedge the risk of rising interest rates, and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt. accordingly, higher interest rates would adversely affect cash flow, net income, and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders.
an environment of rising interest rates could also lead holders of our securities to seek higher yields through other investments, which could adversely affect the market price of our shares. one of the factors which may influence the price of our stock in public markets is the annual distribution rate we pay as compared with the yields on alternative investments.
failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets.
moody's, fitch, and standard & poor's, the major debt rating agencies, routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings of a3 with stable outlook, a- with stable outlook, and a- with stable outlook, respectively, on our senior unsecured debt as of december 31, 2019. these ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. due to changes in market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets.
risks associated with our shares share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders.
for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals. as defined for federal income tax purposes, the term "individuals" includes a number of specified entities. to minimize the possibility of us failing to qualify as a reit under this test, our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits. the ownership limits, as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities, may delay, defer, or prevent a change in control. these provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares which may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares which might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction.
our share price will fluctuate.
the market price and trading volume of our common shares are subject to fluctuation due to general market conditions, the risks discussed in this report and other matters, including, but not limited to, the following:
•   operating results which vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;
•   investor interest in our property portfolio;
•   the reputation and performance of reits;
•   the attractiveness of reits as compared to other investment vehicles;
•   the results of our financial condition and operations;
•   the perception of our growth and earnings potential;
•   minimum dividend requirements;
•   increases in market interest rates, which may lead purchasers of our common shares to demand a higher yield; and
•   changes in financial markets and national and regional economic and general market conditions.
the form, timing and amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations.
the form, timing and amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of our board of trust managers and will depend on actual cash from operations, our financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of trust managers may consider relevant. the board of trust managers may modify the form, timing and amount of dividends from time to time.

executive summary we are primarily engaged in the ownership, management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, and construction of multifamily apartment communities. overall, we focus on investing in markets characterized by high-growth economic conditions, strong employment, and attractive quality of life which we believe leads to higher demand and retention of our apartments. as of december 31, 2019, we owned interests in, operated, or were developing 172 multifamily properties comprised of 58,315 apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the following property portfolio table. in addition, we own other land holdings which we may develop into multifamily apartment communities in the future.
consolidated results net income attributable to common shareholders was approximately $219.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to $156.1 million for the same period in 2018. the approximately $63.5 million, or 40.7% increase was primarily due to an increase from property operations relating to our existing operating, newly developed and acquired operating communities. the increase also related to gains recognized on dispositions in 2019, including two consolidated operating properties and our proportionate share of one operating property by one of our unconsolidated joint ventures. these increases were partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense and a loss on early retirement of debt.
property operations our results for the year ended december 31, 2019 reflect an increase in same store revenues of 3.7% as compared to 2018. these increases were primarily due to higher average rental rates which we believe was primarily attributable to improving job growth, favorable demographics, a manageable supply of new multifamily housing, and in part to more individuals choosing to rent versus buy as evidenced by the continued low level of homeownership rates. we believe the continued low levels of homeownership rates are mainly attributable to costs of obtaining mortgage loans as well as changing trends of certain age-sectors having a higher propensity to rent, all of which promote apartment rentals. we also believe u.s. economic and employment growth are likely to continue during 2020 and the supply of new multifamily homes will likely remain at manageable levels. if economic conditions were to worsen or any of these factors were to adversely change, our operating results could be adversely affected.
construction activity at december 31, 2019, we had a total of eight projects under construction to be comprised of 2,208 apartment homes, including one development project to be comprised of 234 apartment homes owned by one of our unconsolidated discretionary investment funds in which we have a 31.3% ownership interest. initial occupancies of these eight projects are currently scheduled to occur within the next 24 months. excluding the project owned by one of the funds, we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the seven projects to be approximately $358.6 million.
acquisitions operating properties: in december 2019, we acquired one operating property comprised of 186 apartment homes in raleigh, north carolina for approximately $75.1 million, and one operating property comprised of 552 apartment homes in houston, texas for approximately $147.2 million. in may 2019, we acquired one operating property comprised of 326 apartment homes located in austin, texas for approximately $120.4 million. in february 2019, we acquired one operating property comprised of 316 apartment homes located in scottsdale, arizona for approximately $97.1 million.
land: in connection with the acquisition of the operating property in houston, texas in december 2019, we acquired approximately 2.3 acres of land adjacent to the operating property for approximately $8.0 million for the future development of approximately 300 apartment homes. in may 2019, we acquired approximately 11.6 acres of land in tempe, arizona for approximately $18.0 million for the future development of approximately 400 apartment homes. in april 2019, we acquired approximately 4.3 acres of land in charlotte, north carolina for approximately $10.9 million for the future development of approximately 400 apartment homes.
in january 2020, we acquired 4.9 acres of land in raleigh, north carolina for approximately $18.2 million for the future development of approximately 355 apartment homes.
dispositions sale of operating properties: during the year ended december 31, 2019, we sold our remaining three operating properties in corpus christi, texas. the operating properties sold included two consolidated communities comprised of 632 apartment homes and one joint venture community with 270 apartment homes. the total net proceeds from the disposition of the two consolidated communities was approximately $69.4 million and we recognized a gain of approximately $49.9 million. the proceeds from the disposition of the one property owned through the unconsolidated joint venture was approximately $38.5 million and our portion of the gain of approximately $6.2 million was recognized in equity in income of joint ventures.

•   in 2019, we issued approximately 0.2 million shares under our 2017 atm program and received approximately $24.8 million in net proceeds.
future outlook subject to market conditions, we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop new communities, and to redevelop, reposition and acquire existing communities. we also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise. we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations, maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios, and controlling overhead costs. we intend to meet our near-term liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following: cash flows generated from operations, draws on our unsecured credit facility, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our atm programs, other unsecured borrowings, or secured mortgages.
as of december 31, 2019, we had approximately $23.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $847.1 million available under our $900.0 million unsecured credit facility. as of the date of this filing, we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $287.7 million remaining available for sale under our 2017 atm program and do not have any debt maturing through the year ending 2021. additionally, as of december 31, 2019 and through the date of this filing, 100% of our consolidated properties were unencumbered. we believe we are well-positioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to fund new development, redevelopment, and other capital funding requirements. we will, however, continue to assess and take further actions we believe are prudent to meet our objectives and capital requirements.
property portfolio our multifamily property portfolio is summarized as follows:

results of operations changes in revenues and expenses related to our operating properties from period to period are due primarily to the performance of stabilized properties in the portfolio, the lease-up of newly constructed properties, acquisitions, and dispositions. where appropriate, comparisons of income and expense for communities included in continuing operations are made on a dollars-per-weighted average apartment home basis in order to adjust for such changes in the number of apartment homes owned during each period. selected weighted averages for the years ended december 31 are as follows:

management considers property net operating income ("noi") to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance to net income because it reflects the operating performance of our communities without an allocation of corporate level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. we define noi as total property income less property operating and maintenance expenses less real estate taxes. noi is further detailed in the property-level noi table as seen below. noi is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap") and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance, should not be considered an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, and should not be considered an indication of cash available to fund cash needs. additionally, noi as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation.

(1)   for 2019, same store communities are communities we owned and were stabilized since january 1, 2018, excluding communities under redevelopment and properties held for sale. non-same store communities are stabilized communities not owned or stabilized since january 1, 2018, including communities under redevelopment and excluding properties held for sale. we define communities under redevelopment as communities with capital expenditures that improve a community's cash flow and competitive position through extensive unit, exterior building, common area, and amenity upgrades. management believes same store information is useful as it allows both management and investors to determine financial results over a particular period for the same set of communities. development and lease-up communities are non-stabilized communities we have developed since january 1, 2018, excluding properties held for sale. dispositions/other includes those communities disposed of or held for sale which are not classified as discontinued operations, non-multifamily rental properties, expenses related to land holdings not under active development, and other miscellaneous revenues and expenses.
same store analysis year ended december 2019 compared to year ended december 2018
same store property noi increased approximately $24.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. the increase was due to an increase of approximately $30.5 million in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019, partially offset by an increase of approximately $5.8 million in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018.
the $30.5 million increase in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily due to an increase of approximately $28.6 million in rental revenues primarily from a 3.4% increase in average rental rates and an approximately $1.9 million increase in income from our bulk internet rebilling program.
the $5.8 million increase in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily due to higher salary expenses of approximately $3.9 million, higher property insurance expenses of approximately $1.0 million as a result of higher premiums, higher real estate taxes of approximately $0.7 million as a result of higher property valuations and tax rates at a number of our communities, and higher other miscellaneous property expenses of approximately $0.6 million. these increases were partially offset by an approximate $0.4 million decrease related to lower repair and maintenance costs as compared to the same period in 2018.
non-same store and development and lease-up analysis property noi from non-same store and development and lease-up communities increased approximately $26.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. the increase was due to an increase of approximately $42.4 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019, partially offset by an increase of approximately $16.4 million in expenses for the year ended december 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018. the increases in property revenues and expenses from our non-same store communities were primarily due to the acquisition of three operating properties in 2018 and four operating properties in 2019 and the stabilization of one operating property in 2018 and three operating properties in 2019. the increases in property revenues and expenses from our development and lease-up communities were primarily due to the timing of completion and partial lease-up of two properties during 2019. the following table details the changes, described above, relating to non-same store and development and lease-up noi:

* not a meaningful percentage fee and asset management income from property management, asset management, construction, and development activities at our joint ventures and our third-party construction projects increased approximately $1.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. the increase for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher fees earned on capital projects at fund communities, an increase in third-party construction activity, and higher property management fees.
interest and other income increased approximately $1.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, as compared to 2018. the increase was primarily related to higher interest income earned on investments in cash and cash equivalents due to maintaining higher average cash balances in 2019, as compared to 2018.
our deferred compensation plans recognized income of approximately $21.7 million in 2019 and a loss of approximately $6.5 million in 2018. the changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the expense (benefit) related to these plans, as discussed below.

* not a meaningful percentage property management expenses, which primarily represent regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations, decreased approximately $0.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 . the decrease was primarily related to lower discretionary expenses and lower incentive compensation expenses due to a decrease in amortization costs as a result of having substantially three-year awards outstanding in 2019 as compared to having three and five year awards in 2018. the decrease was partially offset by higher other compensation related costs. property management expenses were 2.5% and 2.7% of total property revenues for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
fee and asset management expense from property management, asset management, construction, and development activities at our joint ventures and our third-party construction projects increased approximately $1.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. the increase was primarily due to higher expenses incurred as a result of an increase in capital projects at fund communities and an increase in third-party construction activity.
general and administrative expenses increased approximately $2.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. the increase was primarily due to higher compensation-related costs, professional fees, information technology costs, and other corporate initiative costs. excluding deferred compensation plans, general and administrative expenses were 5.1% and 5.3% of total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
interest expense decreased approximately $3.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. the decrease was primarily due to the repayment of $380 million of secured conventional mortgage notes with a weighted average interest rate of 4.43% in october 2018, the repayment of approximately $439.3 million of secured conventional mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% in the first quarter of 2019, the early redemption of our $250 million, 4.78% senior unsecured notes due 2021, and the prepayment of an approximately $45.3 million, 4.38% secured conventional mortgage note in october 2019. the decrease was partially offset by the issuance of a $100 million unsecured floating rate term loan in september 2018; the issuance of $400 million, 3.74% senior unsecured notes in october 2018; the issuance of $600 million, 3.67% senior unsecured notes in june 2019; and the issuance of $300 million, 3.35% senior unsecured notes in october 2019. the decrease was further offset by an increase in interest expense recognized on our unsecured credit facility due to having higher balances outstanding in 2019 as compared to 2018.
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $35.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of one operating property in september 2018 and four operating properties in 2019, the completion of units in our development pipeline, the completion of repositions and the partial completion of redevelopments during 2019 and 2018.
our deferred compensation plans incurred an expense of approximately $21.7 million in 2019 and a benefit of approximately $6.5 million in 2018. these changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the income (loss) related to these plans, as discussed in the non-property income section above.

gain on sale of operating properties for the year ended december 31, 2019 was due to the sale of two operating properties located in corpus christi, texas in the fourth quarter.
equity in income of joint ventures increased approximately $6.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. the increase was primarily due to the recognition of a $6.2 million proportionate share of the gain related to the sale of one operating property by one of the funds in december 2019 as well as increases in earnings from the operating properties owned by the funds.
income tax expense decreased approximately $0.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, as compared to 2018. the decrease was primarily due to lower state income taxes, which included an approximate $0.1 million state income tax refund. the decrease was partially offset by an increase in taxable income related to our third-party construction activities conducted in a taxable reit subsidiary.
funds from operations ("ffo") and adjusted ffo ("affo")
management considers ffo and affo to be appropriate supplementary measures of the financial performance of an equity reit. the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") currently defines ffo as net income (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains (or losses) associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties, real estate depreciation and amortization, impairments of depreciable assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis. our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities, including certain non-controlling interests, which are convertible into common shares. we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and depreciation, ffo can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company's real estate investments between periods or to different companies.
affo is calculated utilizing ffo less recurring capitalized expenditures which are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain the functionality at our communities. we also consider affo to be a useful supplemental measure because it is frequently used by analysts and investors to evaluate a reit's operating performance between periods or different companies. our definition of recurring capital expenditures may differ from other reits, and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other reits.
to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, we believe ffo and affo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report. ffo and affo are not defined by gaap and should not be considered alternatives to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance. additionally, ffo and affo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation.

(1)   net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december 31, 2019 included an approximate $12 million loss on early retirement of debt related to the redemption of our 4.78% senior notes due 2021 and the prepayment of a 4.38% secured conventional mortgage note due 2045.
liquidity and capital resources financial condition and sources of liquidity we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility, which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available. we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by:
•   extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where practicable;
•   managing interest rate exposure using what management believes to be prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt;
•   maintaining what management believes to be conservative coverage ratios; and
•   using what management believes to be a prudent combination of debt and equity.
our interest expense coverage ratio, net of capitalized interest, was approximately 7.3 and 6.4 times for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses, non-property income, and other expenses after adding back depreciation, amortization, and interest expense. all of our properties were unencumbered at december 31, 2019 and approximately 89.6% and 80.0% of our properties were unencumbered at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. our weighted average maturity of debt was approximately 8.9 years at december 31, 2019.
we also intend to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals, which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations, maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios, and controlling overhead costs.
our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flow generated from operations. other sources may include one or more of the following: availability under our unsecured credit facility, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our atm programs, and other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages. we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2020 including:
•   normal recurring operating expenses;
•   current debt service requirements, including debt maturities;
•   recurring capital expenditures;
•   reposition expenditures;
•   funding of property developments, redevelopments, acquisitions, and joint venture investments; and
•   the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our reit qualification under the code.
factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets, changes in rent control or rent stabilization laws, sources of financing, the minimum reit dividend requirements, our ability to complete asset purchases, sales, or developments, the effect our debt level and changes in credit ratings could have on our cost of funds, and our ability to access capital markets.
cash flows the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018.
net cash from operating activities was approximately $555.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to approximately $503.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was primarily due to growth attributable to our same store, non-same store communities, and development and lease-up communities and changes in our operating accounts. these increases were partially offset by cash outflows related to the settlement of our forward interest rate swaps in 2019 as compared to cash inflows received in 2018. see further discussions of our 2019 operations as compared to 2018 in "results of operations."
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2019 totaled approximately $792.4 million as compared to $640.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2018. cash outflows during 2019 primarily related to property development and capital improvements of approximately $407.6 million, the acquisition of four operating properties for approximately $436.3 million, and increases in non-real estate assets of $17.2 million. these outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of two operating properties of approximately $67.6 million and a net decrease in notes receivable of $1.4 million. cash outflows during 2018 primarily related to property development and capital improvements of approximately $359.2 million, the acquisition of three operating properties for approximately $290.0 million, and increases in non-real estate assets of $14.5 million. these outflows were partially offset by the sale of land of approximately $11.3 million and a net decrease in notes receivable of $9.5 million. the increase in property development and capital improvements for 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily due to the acquisition of three development properties in 2019 as compared to one development property in 2018, the timing and completion of five consolidated operating properties in 2018 and 2019, and the completion of repositions at several of our operating properties. the property development and capital improvements during 2019 and 2018, included the following:

net cash from financing activities totaled approximately $220.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to net cash used of approximately $197.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2018. cash inflows during 2019 primarily related to net proceeds of approximately $890.0 million from the issuance of $600.0 million senior unsecured notes in june 2019 and $300.0 million senior unsecured notes in october 2019, as well as net proceeds of approximately $353.2 million from the issuance of approximately 3.4 million common shares through an underwritten equity offering completed in february 2019 and approximately 0.2 million common shares through our 2017 atm program. we also had net proceeds of $44.0 million of borrowings from our unsecured line of credit. these cash inflows were partially offset by the repayment of approximately $439.3 million of secured conventional mortgage debt in the first quarter of 2019, and the early redemption of our $250 million unsecured notes payable due 2021 and the prepayment of the approximate $45.3 million secured conventional mortgage note due 2045 and associated prepayment penalties in the fourth quarter of 2019. we also used approximately $317.3 million to pay distributions to common shareholders and non-controlling interest holders. cash outflows during 2018 primarily related to the repayment of approximately $380.0 million variable and fixed rate secured conventional mortgage notes, approximately $298.0 million to pay distributions to common shareholders and non-controlling interest holders, and approximately $14.7 million for the repurchase of our common shares and redemption of units. these cash outflows during 2018 were partially offset by net proceeds of approximately $495.5 million from the issuance of $400.0 million senior unsecured notes and the issuance of a $100.0 million unsecured floating-rate term loan.
financial flexibility in march 2019, we amended and restated our $600 million unsecured credit facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date from august 2019 to march 2023, with two options to further extend the facility at our election for two additional six-month periods, and increase the facility from $600 million to $900 million, which may be expanded three times by up to an additional $500 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. the interest rate on our unsecured credit facility is based upon the london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus a margin which is subject to change as our credit ratings change. advances under our credit facility may be priced at the scheduled rates, or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates. these bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of $450 million or the remaining amount available under our credit facility. our credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations. we believe we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations as of december 31, 2019 and through the date of this filing.
our credit facility provides us with the ability to issue up to $50.0 million in letters of credit. while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, it does reduce the amount available. at december 31, 2019, we had approximately $44.0 million of borrowings outstanding on our $900.0 million credit facility and we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $8.9 million, leaving approximately $847.1 million available under our credit facility.
we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement which allows us to offer common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, or warrants, and our amended and restated declaration of trust provides we may issue up to 185 million shares of beneficial interest, consisting of 175 million common shares and 10 million preferred shares. at december 31, 2019, we had approximately 97.2 million common shares outstanding, net of treasury shares and shares held in our deferred compensation arrangements, and no preferred shares outstanding.
in may 2017, we created an at-the market ("atm") share offering program through which we can, but have no obligation to, sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $315.3 million (the "2017 atm program"), in amounts and at times as we determine, into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions. actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common shares, and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us. the proceeds from the sale of our common shares under the 2017 atm program are intended to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include reducing future borrowings under our unsecured line of credit, the repayment of other indebtedness, the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities, funding for development activities, and financing for acquisitions. as of the date of this filing, we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $287.7 million remaining available for sale under the 2017 atm program. no additional shares under the 2017 atm program were sold subsequent to december 31, 2019 through the date of this filing.
we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody's, fitch, and standard and poor's, which were a3 with stable outlook, a- with stable outlook, and a- with stable outlook, respectively, as of december 31, 2019. we believe our ability to access capital markets is also enhanced by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks, fannie mae, freddie mac, or life insurance companies. however, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future.
future cash requirements and contractual obligations one of our principal long-term liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt, including any future borrowings under our unsecured credit facility. as of the date of this filing, we did not have any debt maturing through the year ending december 31, 2021. see note 9, "notes payable," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities.
we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the seven consolidated projects to be approximately $358.6 million. of this amount, we expect to incur costs between approximately $220 million and $240 million during 2020 and to incur the remaining costs during 2021. additionally, we expect to incur costs between approximately $65 million and $75 million related to the start of new development activities, between approximately $52 million and $56 million of repositions and revenue enhancing expenditures, between approximately $16 million and $20 million in redevelopment expenditures and between approximately $72 million and $76 million of additional recurring capital expenditures.
we anticipate meeting our near-term liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following: cash flows generated from operations, draws on our unsecured credit facility, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our 2017 atm program, other unsecured borrowings, or secured mortgages. we continue to evaluate our operating properties and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise.
as a reit, we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute current dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90% of our annual taxable income. in order to reduce the amount of income taxes, our general policy is to distribute at least 100% of our taxable income. in december 2019, we announced our board of trust managers had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.80 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of december 16, 2019. this dividend was subsequently paid on january 17, 2020 and we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units. when aggregated with previous 2019 dividends, this distribution to common shareholders and holders of the common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of $3.20 per share or unit for the year ended december 31, 2019.
in the first quarter of 2020, the company's board of trust managers declared a first quarter dividend of $0.83 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of march 31, 2020. future dividend payments are paid at the discretion of the board of trust managers and depend on cash flows generated from operations, the company's financial condition and capital requirements, distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors which may be deemed relevant by our board of trust managers. assuming similar dividend distributions for the remainder of 2020, our annualized dividend rate for 2020 would be $3.32 as compared to a dividend rate of $3.20 in 2019.
the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december 31, 2019:

(1)   includes all available extension options, amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs, net of scheduled principal payments.
(2)   includes contractual interest payments for our senior unsecured notes and all available extension options. the interest payments on our unsecured term loan with floating interest rates were calculated based on the interest rates in effect as of december 31, 2019.
off-balance sheet arrangements the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured, third-party debt. at december 31, 2019, our unconsolidated joint ventures had outstanding debt of approximately $496.9 million. as of december 31, 2019, we had no outstanding guarantees related to the loans of our unconsolidated joint ventures.
inflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from twelve to fifteen months. in an inflationary environment, we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases. we believe the short-term nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation.
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period. these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies. for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, see note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements," to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
valuation of assets. long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. impairment may exist if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with long-lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets. we consider projected future undiscounted cash flows, trends, strategic decisions regarding future development plans, and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist. while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding a number of factors, including market rents, economic conditions, and occupancies, could significantly affect these estimates. when impairment exists, the long-lived asset is adjusted to its fair value. in estimating fair value, management uses appraisals, management estimates, and discounted cash flow calculations which utilize inputs from a marketplace participant's perspective. in addition, we evaluate our equity investments in joint ventures and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment below our carrying value, we will record an impairment charge.
the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions, including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities. we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses. due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses, it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated.
we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets, properties under development, and land is currently recoverable. however, if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value estimates, we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets. any such material non-cash charges could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

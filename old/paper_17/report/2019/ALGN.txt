item 1a.   risk factors the following discussion is divided into two sections. the first, entitled "risks relating to our business," discusses some of the risks that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. the second, captioned "risks related to our common stock," discusses some of the risks relating to owning our common stock. you should carefully review both sections, as well as our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information appearing in this annual report on form 10-k, for important information regarding these and other risks that may affect us. the fact we have chosen to list one section before the other or that we have identified risks in either section earlier than others should not be interpreted to mean we deem any risks to be more or less important or more likely to occur than others or, if any do occur, that their impact may be any less significant than others. these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this report because they could cause our actual results and conditions to differ materially from those statements. before you invest in align, you should know that investing involves risks, including those described below. the risks below are not the only ones we face. if any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
risks relating to our business our net revenues are dependent primarily on our invisalign system and itero scanners and any decline in sales or average selling price of these products for any reason, would adversely affect net revenues, gross margin and net income.
our net revenues are largely dependent on the sales of our invisalign system of clear aligners and itero intraoral scanners. of the two, we expect net revenues from the sale of the invisalign system, primarily our comprehensive products, will continue to account for the vast majority of our net revenues for the foreseeable future. continued and widespread acceptance of the invisalign system by orthodontists, gps and consumers is critical to our future success. our itero scanners are used by dental professionals for restorative and orthodontic procedures as well as invisalign system case submissions. sales of our itero scanners are continuing to grow, becoming a larger percentage of our overall revenues and as a means to further adoption of digital dentistry and the invisalign system. if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services, if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign system treatment as rapidly or in the volumes we anticipate and at the prices offered, if orthodontists or gps choose to use wires and brackets or competitive products rather than invisalign, if sales of our itero scanners decline or fail to grow sufficiently or as expected, or if the average selling price of our products decline for any reason, particularly in the case of our invisalign system as a result of a shift in product mix towards lower priced products or as a result of promotions, or competition, our operating results would be harmed.
competition in the markets for our products is increasing and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future.
the dental industry is in a period of immense and rapid transformation involving products, technologies, distribution channels and business models, much of which is based on digital transformation involving information technology, data, artificial intelligence, scanning, 3d printing, software and algorithms. while our clear aligner and itero scanners facilitate this transition, there remains significant uncertainty concerning the technologies that will achieve market acceptance and, if adopted, whether and when they may become obsolete as new offerings become available.
currently, our clear aligner products compete directly against traditional metal brackets and wires and increasingly against clear aligner products manufactured and distributed by new market entrants as well as traditional manufacturers of wires and brackets, both within and outside the u.s., and from traditional medical device companies, laboratories, startups and, in some cases, from doctors themselves. although the number and type of competitors varies by segment, geography and customer, we encounter a wide variety of competitors, including new and well-established regional competitors in certain foreign markets, as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales, marketing, research and financial capabilities. due in part to the expiration of certain of our key patents beginning in 2017, we have faced increased competition in the clear aligner market. these competitors include existing larger companies in certain markets who have the ability to leverage their existing channels in the dental market to compete directly with us, direct-to-consumer ("dtc") companies that provide clear aligners using a remote teledentistry model that requires little or no in-office care from trained and licensed physicians, and doctors themselves who can manufacture custom aligners in their offices using modern 3d printing technology. in addition, corresponding foreign patents began expiring in 2018 which has resulted in increased competition in markets outside the u.s. large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market.
the manipulation and movement of teeth and bone is a delicate process with potentially painful and debilitating results if not appropriately performed and monitored. accordingly, we remain committed to delivering our solutions primarily through trained and skilled doctors. invisalign treatment requires a doctor's prescription and an in person physical examination of the patient's dentition before beginning treatment. however, with the advent of dtc providers accompanied by significant advertising campaigns, there has been some shifting away from traditional practices that may impact our primary selling channels. we also believe doctors are sampling alternative products and/or taking advantage of wires and brackets bundles that essentially give clear aligners away for free or at reduced prices. in addition, we may also face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies. we may be unable to compete with these competitors or one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive. if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any new technologies, our business could be harmed. increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions, reduced gross margins and profitability, loss of market share, and result in the reduction of dental professionals' efforts and commitment to use our products, any of which could materially adversely affect our net revenues, volume growth, net income and stock price. we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we are dependent on our international operations, which exposes us to foreign operational, political and other risks that may harm our business.
our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the u.s. technicians use a sophisticated, internally developed computer-modeling program to prepare digital clinical treatment plans ("clincheck"), which are then transmitted electronically to our aligner fabrication facilities. these digital files form the basis of the clincheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture aligner molds and aligners. our digital treatment planning and aligner fabrication are performed in multiple international locations and we are continuing to establish these functions closer to our international customers to improve doctor and patient experiences and our operational efficiency. also, in addition to research and development efforts conducted in the u.s., russia and israel, we have operations in israel and china where we assemble wands, and our intraoral scanner is manufactured. our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation, including:
•   difficulties in hiring and retaining employees generally, as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations;
•   difficulties in managing international operations, including any travel restrictions on us or our customers such as those recently imposed in china in response to the novel coronavirus epidemic;
•   fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
•   import and export controls, license requirements and restrictions;
•   controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process;
•   political, social and economic instability, including increased levels of violence in juarez, mexico, hong kong or the middle east. we cannot predict the effect on us of any future armed conflict, political instability or violence in these regions. in addition, some of our employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and may be called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances. we cannot predict the full impact of these conditions on us, particularly if emergency circumstances or an escalation in political situations occur. if many of our employees are called for active duty, our operations in israel and our business may not be able to function at full capacity;
•   acts of terrorism and acts of war;
•   general geopolitical instability and the responses to it, such as the possibility of sanctions, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs, including recent sanctions against china and russia and tariffs imposed by the u.s. and china and the possibility of additional tariffs or other trade restrictions between the u.s. and mexico;
•   interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services;
•   product or material transportation delays or disruption, including as a result of customs clearance, violence, protests, police and military actions, or as a result of natural disasters, such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions;
•   burdens of complying with a wide variety of regional and local laws, including competition and anti-bribery laws;
•   the impact of government-led initiatives to encourage the purchase or support of domestic vendors, which can affect the willingness of customers to purchase products from, or collaborate to promote interoperability of products with, companies whose headquarters or primarily operations are not domestic;
•   unexpected issues and expenses related to our corporate structure reorganization;
•   reduced intellectual property rights protections as compared to the u.s;
•   longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection; and
•   potential adverse tax consequences.
the united kingdom's ("u.k.") withdrawal from the eu on january 31, 2020, commonly known as "brexit," has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above. the withdrawal of the u.k. from the eu could, among other potential outcomes, adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject. the withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the u.k. and the eu and significantly disrupt trade between the u.k. and the eu and other parties. further, uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the u.k., eu and the other economies in which we operate. as the withdrawal continues to unfold, the actual implications of brexit in their entirety are unlikely to be known for years.
if any of the risks outlined above materialize in the future, we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenues.
we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales and face risks attendant to those operations.
we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales generated through our foreign direct and indirect operations. since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to penetrate international markets and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the u.s., particularly in markets we believe to have high-growth potential. our international operations are subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-u.s. operations, including:
•   local political and economic instability;
•   the engagement of activities by our employees, contractors, partners and agents, especially in countries with developing economies, that are prohibited by international and local trade and labor laws and other laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act of 2010 and export control laws, in spite of our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws;
•   fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
•   increased expense of developing, testing and making localized versions of our products; and
•   health pandemics such as the new coronavirus in china and natural disasters including weather and fires such as those common in california and recently in australia.
any of these factors, either individually or in combination, could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole.
demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a weakness in general economic conditions and resistance to non-traditional treatment methods.
consumer spending habits are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. a general slowdown in the u.s. economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may, among other things, result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts, reduced patient traffic in dentists' offices, reduction in consumer spending on elective, non-urgent, or higher value procedures or a reduction in the demand for dental services generally, each of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results. weakness in the global economy results in a challenging environment for selling dental technologies and dentists may postpone investments in capital equipment, such as intraoral scanners. in addition, invisalign treatment, which currently accounts for the vast majority of our net revenues, represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment involving metal brackets and wires, and customers and consumers may be reluctant to accept it, or may not find it cost-effective or preferable to traditional treatment. we have generally received positive feedback from orthodontists, gps and consumers regarding invisalign treatment as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for the treatment of malocclusion, but a number of dental professionals believe that the invisalign treatment is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients. increased market acceptance of all of our products will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals, as well as other factors including effectiveness, safety, ease of use, reliability, aesthetics, and price compared to competing products and treatment methods.
our success may depend on our ability to develop, successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products or product offerings.
our success depends on our ability to profitably develop, manufacture, market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products and improvements to existing products. there is no assurance we can successfully develop, sell and achieve market acceptance of new or improved products and services. the extent of, and rate at which, market acceptance and penetration are achieved by new or future products or offerings is a function of many variables, which include, among other things, our ability to:
•   correctly predict, timely develop and cost effectively manufacture or bring to market solutions that meet future customer needs and preferences with the features and functionality they desire or expect;
•   allocate our research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;
•   ensure compatibility of our computer operating systems and hardware configurations with those of our customers;
•   anticipate and rapidly respond to new competitive products, product offerings and technological innovations;
•   differentiate our products and product offerings from our competitors as well as other products in our own portfolio and successfully articulate the benefits of those differences to our customers;
•   innovate and develop new technologies and applications;
•   the availability of third-party reimbursement of procedures using our products;
•   obtain and protect adequate intellectual property rights; and
•   encourage customers to adopt new technologies.
if we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenues. even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements, we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer. in addition, even if our new products are successfully introduced, it may be difficult to gain market share and acceptance, particularly if doctors require education to understand the benefits of the new products or measure their success only after extended periods of time required to treat patients. for instance, it can take up to 24 months or longer to treat patients using our invisalign system. similarly, we recently introduced our mandibular advancement treatment and expect it will require significant time and effort on our part to educate doctors to the benefits of this treatment method. consequently, doctors may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available.
our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation, including approval or clearance by the fda and foreign government agencies. any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our net revenues to decline.
we may experience declines in average selling prices of our products which may decrease our net revenues.
we provide volume-based discount programs to our customers. in addition, we sell a number of products at different list prices which also differ based on regions and or country. if we change volume-based discount programs affecting our average selling prices; if we introduce any price reductions or consumer rebate programs; if we expand our discount programs or participation in these programs increases; if our critical accounting estimates materially differ from actual behavior or results; or if our geographic, channel, or product mix shifts to lower priced products or to products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue, our average selling prices would be adversely affected. moreover, we may find that some programs are unsuccessful or, even if successful may drive demand in unexpected ways. were any of the foregoing to occur, our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin and net income may be reduced.
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
although the u.s. dollar is our reporting currency, a growing portion of our net revenues and net income are generated in foreign currencies. net revenues and net income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the u.s. are translated into u.s. dollars using constantly fluctuating, often substantially, exchange rates during the respective period. as a result, negative movements in exchange rates against the u.s. dollar have and may increasingly adversely affect our net revenues and net income in our consolidated financial statements. we enter into currency forward contract transactions in an effort to cover some of our exposure to currency fluctuations but there is no assurance these transactions will fully or effectively hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations, and, under certain circumstances, these transactions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
as we continue to grow, we are subject to growth related risks, including risks related to excess or constrained capacity and operational inefficiencies at our manufacturing and treat facilities.
we are subject to growth related risks, including excess or constrained capacity and pressure on our internal systems and personnel. in order to manage current operations and future growth effectively, we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational, financial and management information systems and to hire, train, motivate, manage and retain employees. we may be unable to manage such growth effectively. any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations and prospects. we continue to establish additional order acquisition, treatment planning and manufacturing facilities closer to our international customers in order to provide doctors with a better experience, improve their confidence in using invisalign to treat more patients, more often and provide redundancy should other facilities be temporarily or permanently unavailable. our ability to plan, construct and equip additional order acquisition, treatment planning and manufacturing facilities is subject to significant risk and uncertainty, including risks inherent in the establishment of a facility, such as hiring and retaining employees and delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors, any of which may be out of our control and may negatively impact our gross margin. in addition, these facilities may be located in higher cost regions compared to mexico and costa rica, which may negatively impact our gross margin. if the transition into additional facilities is significantly delayed or demand for our products exceeds our current expectations, we may be unable to fulfill orders timely, which may negatively impact our financial results, reputation and overall business. in addition, because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, our facility capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. production of our intraoral scanners may also be limited by capacity constraints due to a variety of factors, including our dependency on third party vendors for key components in addition to limited production yields. any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results.
if we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods, our profitability may decline.
if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods, we need to continue increasing our net revenues, while controlling expenses. because our business is evolving, it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth, and we have not in the past and may be unable in the future to sustain our historical growth rates which may cause our profitability to decline.
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future, making it difficult to predict the timing and amount of revenues, costs and expenditures.
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons, particularly as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products.  some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include:
•   limited visibility into and difficulty predicting from quarter to quarter, the level of activity in our customers' practices;
•   changes in geographic, channel, or product mix;
•   weakness in consumer spending as a result of a slowdown in the global, u.s. or other economies;
•   higher manufacturing costs;
•   competition in general and competitive developments in the market;
•   changes in relationships with our dental support organizations and distributors, including timing of orders;
•   changes in the timing of when revenues are recognized, including as a result of the timing of receipt of product orders and shipments, the introduction of new products and software releases, product offerings or promotions, modifications to our terms and conditions or as a result of new accounting pronouncements or changes to critical accounting estimates including, without limitation, those estimates based on such matters as our predicted usage of additional aligners;
•   fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the u.s. dollar;
•   our inability to scale, suspend or reduce production based on variations in product demand;
•   increased participation in our customer rebate or discount programs could adversely affect our average selling prices;
•   seasonal fluctuations, including those related to patient demographics such as teen buying habits in china and europe as well as the number of doctors in their offices and their availability to take appointments;
•   success of or changes to our marketing programs from quarter to quarter;
•   our reliance on our contract manufacturers for the production of sub-assemblies for our intraoral scanners;
•   increased advertising or marketing efforts or aggressive price competition from competitors;
•   changes to our effective tax rate;
•   unanticipated delays and disruptions in the manufacturing process caused by insufficient capacity or availability of raw materials, turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes, power outages or natural or other disasters beyond our control;
•   underutilization of manufacturing and treat facilities;
•   major changes in available technology or the preferences of customers may cause our current product offerings to become less competitive or obsolete;
•   costs and expenditures in connection with litigation;
•   costs and expenditures in connection with the establishment of treatment planning and fabrication facilities in international locations;
•   costs and expenditures in connection with hiring and deployment of direct sales force personnel;
•   unanticipated delays in our receipt of patient records made through intraoral scanners for any reason;
•   disruptions to our business due to political, economic or other social instability or any governmental regulatory or similar actions, including the impact of an epidemic such as recent developments beginning in china in connection with the novel coronavirus, any of which results in changes in consumer spending habits, consumers unable or unwilling to visit the orthodontist or general practitioners office, as well as any impact on workforce absenteeism;
•   inaccurate forecasting of net revenues, production and other operating costs;
•   investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements;
•   material impairments in the value of our privately held companies; and
•   timing of industry tradeshows.
to respond to these and other factors, we may make business decisions that adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy, promotions, development efforts, product releases, business structure or operations. most of our expenses, such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations, are relatively fixed in the short term. moreover, our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future revenue levels. as a result, if our net revenues for a particular period fall below expectations, we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in net revenues. due to these and other factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance.
a disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings.
we are dependent on commercial freight carriers, primarily ups, to deliver our products. if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason, we may be unable to timely deliver our products to our customers. if we cannot deliver our products on time and cost effectively, our customers may choose competitive offerings or create their own aligners causing our net revenues and gross margins to decline, possibly materially. in a rising fuel cost environment, our freight costs will increase. in addition, we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales. international sales carry higher shipping costs which could negatively impact our gross margin and results of operations. if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of net revenues, our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected.
if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand, or hire technicians faster than our actual growth projections, the delivery time of our products could be delayed or our costs may exceed our revenues, each of which could adversely affect our results of operations.
treatment planning is a key step leading to our manufacturing process which relies on sophisticated computer software. this requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process, often up to 120 days or longer. as a result, if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth, we may have an insufficient number of trained technicians to deliver our products within the time frame our customers expect. such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers. this could cause a decline in our net revenues and net income and could adversely affect our results of operations. conversely, if we hire and train technicians in anticipation of volume growth that does not materialize or materializes at a rate we do not anticipate, our costs and expenditures may outpace our revenue growth, harming our gross margins, operating expenses and financial results.
our information technology systems are critical to our business. system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.
we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems. all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources. as our business has grown in size and complexity, the growth has placed, and will continue to place significant demands on such systems. to effectively manage this growth, our information systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. we are continuing to transform certain business processes, extend established processes to new subsidiaries and/or implement additional functionality in our enterprise resource planning ("erp") software system which entails certain risks, including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt our operations, such as our ability to track orders and timely ship products, manage our supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data.
system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources. delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.
additionally, we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications, specifically the clincheck software, myaligntech and the invisalign doctor site. software applications frequently contain errors or defects, especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released. the discovery of a defect or error in our software applications or information systems, or incompatibility with customers' computer operating systems and hardware configurations with a new release or upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences, among others: delay or loss of revenues or delay in market acceptance, damage to our reputation, loss of market share to competition or increased service costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
if the information we rely on to run our businesses were to be found to be inaccurate or unreliable, if we fail to properly maintain our information systems and data integrity, or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner, we could suffer operational disruptions, have customer disputes, fail to produce timely and accurate reports, have regulatory or other legal problems, experience increases in operating and administrative expenses, lose existing customers, have difficulty in attracting new customers or in implementing our growth strategies, or suffer other adverse consequences. in addition, experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security or our cloud-based software servers hosted by third parties and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. furthermore, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture, including "bugs" and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems, viruses and bugs could be significant, and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations, net revenues and operating results.
furthermore, our business requires the secure transmission of confidential patient health information over public networks. because we store and transmit sensitive information including protected patient health information, security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action, litigation, possible liability and loss. we have experienced breaches in the past and our security measures may be inadequate to prevent future security breaches, and our business operations and profitability would be adversely affected by, among other things, loss of customers and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented.
there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems, developing new systems to support our expanding operations, integrating new systems, protecting confidential patient health information, and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised or we are unable to comply with data protection laws, patient care could suffer, and we could be liable for related damages, and our reputation could be impaired.
we retain confidential customer financial as well as patient health information in our processing centers. therefore, it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are also perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure. despite the implementation of security measures, we have experienced breaches in the past and our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors or other technical malfunctions, hacking or phishing attacks by third parties, employee error or malfeasance or similar disruptive problems. if we fail to meet our customer and patients' expectations regarding the security of customer and patient information, we could be liable for damages and our reputation and competitive position could be impaired. affected parties could initiate legal or regulatory action against us, which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders forcing us to modify our business practices. concerns over our privacy practices could adversely affect others' perception of us and deter customers, advertisers and partners from using our products. in addition, patient care could suffer, and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner. we have cybersecurity insurance related to a breach event covering expenses for notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations and legal advice. the policy also provides coverage for regulatory action defense including fines and penalties, potential payment card industry fines and penalties and costs related to cyber extortion; however, damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any coverage.
we are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, including ones relating to privacy, data protection, content regulation, and consumer protection. we may be or become subject to data localization or data residency laws which generally require that certain types of data collected within a country be stored and processed only within that country or approved countries. some countries, including russia and china, have enacted, and others are considering enacting, data localization or data residency laws. if countries in which we have customers adopt data localization or data residency laws, we could be required to implement new or expand existing data storage protocols, build new storage facilities, and/or devote additional resources to comply with the requirements of such laws, any of which could have significant cost implications. we may also be subject to data export restrictions, or international transfer laws which prohibit or impose conditions upon the transfer of such data from one country to another. these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created or amended in a manner that could adversely affect our business.
in addition, we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the u.s. to multinational requirements in the eu. in the eu, we must comply with the general data protection regulation ("gdpr") which serves as a harmonization of european data-privacy laws. we believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of applicable data protection laws and regulations. maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients. additionally, our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers in managing data protection requirements.
in order to deepen our market penetration and raise awareness of our brand and products, we have increased the amount we spend on marketing activities, which may not ultimately prove successful or an effective use of our resources.
to increase awareness of our products and services domestically and internationally, we have increased the amount we spend, and anticipate spending in the future on marketing activities. our marketing efforts and costs are significant and include national and regional campaigns involving television, print media, social media and, more recently, alliances with professional sports teams and other strategic partners. we attempt to structure our advertising campaigns in ways we believe most likely to increase brand awareness and adoption; however, there is no assurance our campaigns will achieve the returns on advertising spend desired or successfully increase brand or product awareness sufficiently to sustain or increase our growth goals, which could have an adverse effect on our gross margin and business overall.
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology, and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position may be harmed. litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price.
our success depends in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property rights and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products, both in the u.s. and in other countries. our inability to do so could harm our competitive position. for further details concerning our patents and other intellectual property, please see "intellectual property" in part i, item 1. business" of this annual report on form 10-k.
we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the u.s. and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position; however, our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents. additionally, any patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable, circumvented, or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products. in addition, any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under u.s. patents and intellectual property laws. certain of our key patents began to expire in 2017, which have resulted in increased competition and less expensive competitive products. we also rely on protection of our copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and proprietary information. we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us; however, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information, and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur. our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents, copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and future growth prospects. in particular, a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology, which could adversely affect our pricing and market share. in addition, in an effort to protect our intellectual property we are currently, have in the past been, and may in the future be involved in litigation. the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future, whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us, are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations.
litigation, interferences, oppositions, re-exams, inter partes reviews, post grant reviews or other proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. litigation, interference, oppositions, re-exams, inter partes reviews, post grant reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. the outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages. an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases where injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products. any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price.
obtaining approvals and complying with regulations enforced by the fda and foreign regulatory authorities is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to obtain or maintain approvals for our products or services or failure to comply with regulations could materially harm our sales, result in substantial penalties and cause harm to our reputation.
our products are considered medical devices and are subject to extensive and widely varying regulations in the u.s. and internationally. before we can sell a new medical device in the u.s., or market a new use of or claim for an existing product, we must obtain fda clearance or approval unless an exemption applies. internationally, similar requirements apply on a country by country basis. in the u.s., fda regulations are wide ranging and govern, among other things:
•   product design, development, manufacturing and testing;
•   product labeling;
•   product storage;
•   pre-market clearance or approval;
•   complaint handling and corrective actions;
•   advertising and promotion; and
•   product sales and distribution.
it takes significant time, effort and expense to obtain and maintain fda approvals of our products and services. in other countries, the requirements to obtain and maintain similar approvals may differ materially from those of the fda. moreover, there is no guarantee we will successfully obtain or maintain approvals in all or any of the countries in which we do business now or in the future. even if we are successful, the time and effort may take significantly longer, and costs may be significantly greater.  if approvals to market our products or services are delayed, whether in the u.s. or other countries, we may be unable to market our products or services in markets we deem important to our business. were any of these risks to occur, our domestic or international operations may be materially harmed, and our business as a whole adversely impacted.
in addition, our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement actions in the u.s. and other countries. for example, enforcement actions by the fda may include any of the following sanctions:
•   warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•   repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;
•   operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•   refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;
•   withdrawing clearance or pre-market approvals that have already been granted; and
•   criminal prosecution.
we must also comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations. the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections. our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action, and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers, which could be a long and costly process. any enforcement action by the fda or foreign governments could have a material adverse effect on us.
the sourcing and availability of metals used in the manufacture of a limited number of parts (if any) contained in our products may be affected by laws and regulations in the u.s. or internationally regarding the use of minerals obtained from certain regions of the world like the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries. these laws and regulations may decrease the number of suppliers capable of supplying our needs for certain metals, thereby negatively affecting our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. we may furthermore suffer financial and reputational harm if customers require, and we are unable to deliver, certification that our products are conflict free. regardless, we will incur additional costs associated with compliance with these laws and regulations, including time-consuming and costly efforts to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products.
we are required to annually assess our internal control over financial reporting and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.
we have implemented and routinely assess, update and refine our internal control over financial reporting for its effectiveness. pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec, we are required to furnish in our form 10-k a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. the report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. our internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions including changes in personnel, updates and upgrades to existing software including our erp software system, changes in accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards, and, as a result, the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the existing policies or procedures may become ineffective. establishing, testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff, may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments and increases our costs of doing business. if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period (or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective), the timely filing of our financial reports could be delayed or we could be required to restate past reports, and cause us to lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel, we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products.
we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering, technology development, sales, training and marketing personnel and management teams. the loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business. our future success will also depend on our ability to identify, recruit, train and retain additional qualified personnel, including orthodontists and production technicians in our treatment planning facilities. few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices, universities and other research institutions. thus, we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business. furthermore, we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be materially harmed.
if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim, our ability to grow our business may be severely limited.
extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry. we have been sued for infringement of third party's patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future. we periodically receive and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights. while we do not believe we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention, there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware. the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel. an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities. an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties. licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, in which event, our business would be materially adversely affected.
we maintain single supply relationships for certain key machines and materials, and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases.
we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment, rapid prototyping machines, resin and other advanced materials, as well as the optics, electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners. we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies. in particular, our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our scanners are provided by single suppliers. we are also committed to purchasing the vast majority of our resin and polymer, the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners, from a single source. if these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we may be unable to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply and could face production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies. in addition, technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive, time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes. our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth. conversely, in order to secure supplies for production of products, we sometimes enter into non-cancelable minimum purchase commitments with vendors, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. if demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer. in the event of technology changes, delivery delays, or shortages of or increases in price for these items, our business and growth prospects may be harmed.
we depend on a single contract manufacturer and supplier of parts used in our itero scanner and any disruption in this relationship may cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships.
we rely on a third-party manufacturer to supply key sub-assemblies for our itero element scanner. as a result, if this manufacturer fails to deliver its components, if we lose its services or if we fail to negotiate or maintain acceptable terms, we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed. furthermore, any difficulties encountered by this manufacturer with respect to hiring personnel and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards, controls, procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to timely deliver our products. finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive, time-consuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our intraoral scanning products. any failure by our contract manufacturer that results in delays in our fulfillment of customer orders may cause us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships.
we primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products, and any failure to train and maintain our direct sales force could harm our business.
our ability to sell our products and generate revenues primarily depends upon our direct sales force within our americas and international markets. we do not have any long-term employment contracts with our direct sales force and the loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business. in order to provide more comprehensive sales and service coverage, we continue to increase the size of our sales force to pursue growth opportunities within and outside of our existing geographic markets. moreover, as we focus on market penetration, we have begun to segregate sales personnel to focus on specific markets such as orthodontists and gps. to adequately train new representatives to successfully market and sell our products and for them to establish strong customer relationships can take up to twelve months or more. as a result, if we are unable to retain our direct sales personnel or quickly replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications, if we are unable to successfully instill technical expertise in new and existing sales representatives, if we fail to establish and maintain strong relationships with our customers, or if our efforts at specializing our selling techniques do not prove successful and cost-effective, our net revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed. in addition, due to our large and fragmented customer base, we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product. as a result, adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our net revenues may be harmed.
as compliance with healthcare regulations becomes more costly and difficult for us or our customers, we may be unable to grow our business.
participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal, state and local levels, some of which are, and others of which may be, applicable to our business.
furthermore, our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us. the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act ("hipaa"), including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services, result in delays or cancellations of orders, or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants. the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities.
extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties.
in addition to medical device laws and regulations, numerous state and federal healthcare-related laws regulate our business, covering areas such as:
•   storage, transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records;
•   prohibitions against the offer, payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order, purchase or recommendation of our products; and
•   the marketing and advertising of our products.
complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and time-consuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues.
our business exposes us to potential product liability claims, and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation.
medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity. we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unhealthy or unsuitable. although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance, adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. a product liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could result in significant legal defense costs and damage our reputation. these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management's attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business.
business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.
our global operations may be disrupted by natural or human induced disasters including, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, drought, hurricanes, typhoons, wildfires, extreme weather conditions, power shortages, telecommunications failures, materials scarcity and price volatility, and medical epidemics or health pandemics. climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of natural disasters and, consequently, risks to our operations and growth. the occurrence of business disruptions could harm our growth and expansion, result in significant losses, seriously harm our revenue, profitability and financial condition, adversely affect our competitive position, increase our costs and expenses, and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. our digital dental modeling is primarily processed in our facility located in san jose, costa rica. the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software. in addition, our customer facing operations are located in costa rica. our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in juarez, mexico and, we have and are building additional facilities in china. both locations in costa rica and mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters. if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located, our ability to create clincheck treatment plans, respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing significant delays receiving their aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time. additionally, our sales and operations in china have been impacted and are likely to continue to be disrupted as a result of the novel coronavirus outbreak. moreover, our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california, which suffers from earthquakes, periodic droughts, and wildfires affecting the health and safety of our employees. any such business interruptions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
changes in, or interpretations of, accounting rules and regulations, could result in unfavorable accounting charges.
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. ("gaap"). these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. a change in these policies or in the way these policies are interpreted by us or regulators can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions.
if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully, our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted.
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal. to achieve this objective, a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade, liquid, fixed-income securities and money market instruments denominated in u.s. dollars. if the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value, and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we will be required to write down the value of our investments, which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition. moreover, the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the u.s. financial sector. in an unstable credit environment, we might incur significant realized, unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments.
if our goodwill or long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
under gaap, we review our goodwill and long-lived asset group for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. additionally, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. the qualitative and quantitative analysis used to test goodwill are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management's best estimates. changes in certain assumptions including revenue growth rates, discount rates, earnings multiples and future cash flows may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or the asset group may be impaired. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or asset group are determined.
we may experience unexpected issues and expenses associated with our corporate structure reorganization, including the relocation of our emea regional headquarters to switzerland.
we reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships in january 2020 in an effort to more closely align our international business activities and to achieve financial and operational efficiencies. the implementation of this reorganization plan included the move of our emea regional headquarters from the netherlands to switzerland, has been time-consuming and costly, may be disruptive to our business, and, following completion of the reorganization plan, may not be more efficient or effective. this relocation is accompanied by a number of risks and uncertainties that may affect our results of operations and statement of cash flows, including:
•   failure to retain key employees who possess specific knowledge or expertise and upon whom we are depending upon for the timely and successful transition;
•   difficulties in hiring employees in switzerland with the necessary skills and expertise; and
•   increased costs as we transition the operations to switzerland along with higher costs of doing business in switzerland.
if any of these risks materialize in the future, our operating results, statement of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.
our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period.
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate. these factors include, but are not limited to, changes in legal entity structure and/or activities performed within our entities, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, new or changes to accounting pronouncements, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates, changes in overall levels of pretax earnings, the future levels of tax benefits of stock-based compensation, settlement of income tax audits and non-deductible goodwill impairments. for example, our effective tax rate will vary significantly in our first quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the relocation of our emea regional headquarters from the netherlands to switzerland effective january 1, 2020. also, we may continue to experience significant variation in our effective tax rate related to excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation, particularly in the first quarter of each year when the majority of our equity awards vest.
changes in tax laws or tax rulings could negatively impact our income tax provision and net income.
as a u.s. multinational corporation, we are subject to changing tax laws both within and outside of the u.s. changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, could affect our income tax provision and net income or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. in addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. many countries in europe, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws. for example, the organization for economic cooperation and development ("oecd") has been working on a "base erosion and profit shifting project," which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions. the oecd has issued and is expected to continue to issue, guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business.
we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments. impairments in the value of our investments and unsecured promissory note could negatively impact our financial results.
we have invested in privately held companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives, and we may not realize a return on our strategic investments. many of such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services or technologies may be slow to develop. further, valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. if we determine that our investments have experienced a decline in value or are determined to be uncollectible, we may be required to record impairments which could be material and could have an adverse impact on our financial results.
risks related to our common stock historically, the market price for our common stock has been volatile.
the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. the factors include:
•   quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity or changes in our forecasts and guidance;
•   changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our net revenues or operating results;
•   speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations;
•   announcements by competitors or new market entrants;
•   strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as management changes, material transactions or acquisitions;
•   announcements regarding stock repurchases, sales of our common stock, credit agreements and debt issuances;
•   announcements of technological innovations or new products or product offerings by us, our customers or competitors;
•   key decisions in pending litigation
•   sales of stock by us, our officers or directors; and
•   general economic market conditions.
in addition, the stock market, in general, and the market for technology and medical device companies, in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. historically, class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities and we have not been excepted from such litigation.
we cannot guarantee we will continue to repurchase our common stock, and any repurchases may not achieve our objectives.
we have a history of recurring stock repurchase programs intended to return capital to our investors. any authorization or continuance of our share repurchase programs is contingent on a variety of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, and our board of directors' continuing determination that share repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders and in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements. there is no assurance that we will continue to repurchase stock consistent with historical levels or at all, or that our stock repurchase programs will have a beneficial impact on our stock price.
future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price.
a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders. these stockholders have sold in the past, and may sell in the future, large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time. sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price.
item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with "selected consolidated financial data" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 is presented under results of operations of this form 10-k. discussions regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2018 compared to 2017 have been omitted from this annual report on form 10-k, but can be found in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018, filed with the sec on february 28, 2019, which is available without charge on the sec's website at www.sec.gov and on our investor relations website at investor.aligntech.com.
overview our goals are to establish invisalign clear aligners as the standard method for treating malocclusion which, to date, over 8 million people worldwide have been treated with our invisalign system, and to establish the itero intraoral scanner as the preferred scanning device for 3d digital scans, ultimately driving increased clear aligner and other product adoption by dental professionals. we intend to achieve these goals by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers set forth in the business strategy section of this annual report on form 10-k.
the successful execution of our business strategy in 2020 and beyond may be affected by a number of factors including:
•   new invisalign products and feature enhancements. we believe product innovation drives greater treatment predictability, clinical applicability and ease of use for the dental professionals we serve customers which supports adoption of invisalign treatment in their practices. our focus is to develop solutions and features to treat a wide range of cases from simple to complex.
•   we rolled out invisalign treatment with mandibular advancement, the first clear aligner solution for class ii correction in growing tween and teen patients in multiple regions and countries throughout 2018. this offering combines the benefits of our clear aligner system with features for moving the lower jaw forward while simultaneously aligning the teeth without the need for elastics typically used to treat teen class ii patients.
•   in april 2018, we announced invisalign go product with more user-friendly itero digital chairside experience and greater flexibility to treat a wider range of mild to moderate cases. invisalign go also incorporates new data-driven clinical protocols for predictable tooth movement and automated case assessments that leverages our invisalign patients treated to date. these improvements make it easier for general practitioner ("gp") dentists to tailor their treatment plans to the individual needs of each patient.
•   in july 2018, we announced invisalign first clear aligners which are a treatment option designed with features specifically for younger patients with early mixed dentition with a mixture of primary/baby and permanent teeth. phase 1 treatment is an early interceptive orthodontic treatment for young patients, traditionally done through arch expanders, or partial metal braces, before all permanent teeth have erupted, typically at ages seven through ten years. invisalign first clear aligners are designed specifically to address a broad range of younger patients' malocclusions, including shorter clinical crowns, management of erupting dentition and predictable dental arch expansion.
•   in october 2019, we launched the invisalign moderate package for the treatment of mild to moderate malocclusion. the invisalign moderate treatment includes all the features of invisalign treatment, plus additional features that address the orthodontic needs of teenage patients such as compliance indicators and compensation for tooth eruption.
•   new itero products and technology innovation. the itero scanner is an important component to our customer experience and is central to a digital approach as well as overall customer utilization of invisalign.
•   in april 2018, we expanded the itero element portfolio with the launch of the itero element 2 and the itero element flex scanners, building on the existing high precision, full-color imaging and fast scan times of the itero element portfolio while streamlining orthodontic and restorative workflows. the next-generation itero element 2 is designed for greater performance with 2x faster start-up and 25% faster scan processing time compared to the itero element. the new itero element flex wand-only configuration is a portable scanner for easy transport from office to office.
as we continue to expand our global presence, we expect to seek regulatory approvals to offer our itero portfolio products in more countries, thereby tapping potential growth opportunities in underserved markets
•   in february 2019, we announced the launch of itero element 5d imaging system for comprehensive, preventative and restorative oral care. the itero element 5d imaging system provides a new comprehensive approach to clinical applications, workflows and user experience that expands the suite of existing high-precision, full color imaging and fast scan times of the itero element portfolio. the itero element 5d imaging system is available in the majority of emea and select apac countries. the itero element 5d imaging system is pending regulatory approval and is not yet available in the u.s. or latam countries.
•   in june 2019, we announced the launch of itero element foundation intraoral scanner with restorative software. the itero element foundation extends align's portfolio of intraoral scanners with powerful 3d visualization to better meet the needs of doctors, labs and patients. the itero element foundation is available in north america and will also be available in other select countries in 2020.
we believe that over the longterm, clinical solutions and treatment tools will increase adoption of invisalign and increase sales of our intraoral scanners; however, it is difficult to predict the rate of adoption which may vary by region and channel.
the use of itero and other digital scanners for invisalign case submission in place of pvs impressions continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for invisalign utilization. for the fourth quarter of 2019, total invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the americas increased to 79.5%, up slightly from 78.8% in the third quarter of 2019. international scans increased to 64.7%, up from 62.6% in the third quarter of 2019. we believe that over the longterm, technology innovation and added features and functionality of our itero scanners will increase adoption of invisalign and increase sales of our intraoral scanners; however, it is difficult to predict the rate of adoption which may vary by region and channel.
•   invisalign adoption. our goal is to establish invisalign as the treatment of choice for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption and frequency of use by dental professionals, also known as "utilization rates." our annual utilization rates for the last three fiscal years are as follows:
* invisalign utilization rates are calculated by the # of cases shipped divided by the # of doctors to whom cases were shipped. our international region includes emea and apac. latam is excluded from the above chart as it is immaterial.
◦   total utilization in 2019 increased to 15.9 cases per doctor compared to 15.7 cases in 2018.
▪   north america: utilization for both our north american orthodontist and gp customers increased in 2019 to 65.0 and 9.5 cases per doctor compared to 56.7 cases and 9.1 cases per doctor in 2018, respectively. the increase in utilization in 2019 reflects improvements in product and technology which continues to strengthen our doctors' clinical confidence such that they now utilize invisalign more often and on more complex cases, including their teenage patients.
▪   international: international doctor utilization remained relatively flat at 13.8 cases per doctor in 2019 compared to 13.9 cases in 2018.
we expect our utilization rates to gradually improve as a result of advancements in product and technology, which continue to strengthen our doctors' clinical confidence in the use of invisalign clear aligners. in addition, since the teenage and younger market makes up 75% of the approximately 12 million total orthodontic case starts each year, and as we continue to drive adoption of teenage and younger patients through sales and marketing programs, we expect our utilization rates to improve. our utilization rates, however, may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, including seasonal trends in our business along with adoption rates of new products and features.
•   number of new invisalign doctors trained. we continue to expand our invisalign customer base through the training of new doctors. in 2019, we trained 22,270 new invisalign doctors of which 9,765 were trained in the americas region and 12,505 in the international region.
•   international invisalign growth. we continue to focus our efforts towards increasing invisalign clear aligner adoption by dental professionals in the emea and apac markets. on a year-over-year basis, our international invisalign volume increased 34.0% driven primarily by increased adoption as well as expansion of our customer base in both the emea and apac regions. however, beginning in the second quarter of 2019, we experienced slower growth rates than prior periods in china primarily due to the us-china trade war and resulting economic uncertainty which caused headwind for consumer demand especially for consumption of luxury goods and considered purchases. we also believe there has been increased competitive activity from wires and bracket manufacturers and clear aligner suppliers. in addition, in the first quarter of 2020, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019 ncov) in china has caused increased uncertainty and disruption to our employees, doctors' practices, their patients and consumers. we expect the impact of the novel coronavirus and related efforts by the chinese government to contain its spread, including travel restrictions, extension of the lunar new year and discouraging non-essential medical and dental procedures to adversely impact sales and operations in china for a currently indeterminate period of time. notwithstanding these current issues in china, we continue to see growth from our international orthodontists and gp customers and are seeing more positive traction in the gp channel as we continue to segment our sales and marketing resources and programs specifically around each customer channel. in 2019, we continued to expand in our existing markets through targeted investments in sales coverage and professional marketing and education programs, along with consumer marketing in select country markets. we expect international revenues to continue to grow at a faster rate than the americas for the foreseeable future due to our continued investment in international market expansion, the size of the market opportunities and our relatively low market penetration of these regions. our future growth is dependent upon the continued growth of invisalign adoption and international market penetration.
•   increasing competition. starting in the second quarter of 2019, we began experiencing slower adult case growth from north american orthodontists, reflecting a more competitive environment especially for the young adult demographic. given increased awareness for direct to consumer clear aligners and heavy advertising spend from direct to consumer companies, case starts may be shifting away from traditional practices. we also believe that doctors are sampling alternative products and/or taking advantage of wires and brackets bundles that essentially give clear aligners away for free or at low prices. in the third quarter of 2019, we increased investment in consumer demand with a new advertising campaign for north america and expanding marketing programs such as our concierge service, which connects potential patients with invisalign doctors increasing conversion and loyalty. in addition, we launched new sales tools and professional marketing materials and we also expect to see increased productivity from the approximate 100 sales representatives we added in the first quarter of 2019. if, however, we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors, our business could be harmed.
•   establish regional order acquisition, treatment planning and manufacturing operations. we expect to continue establishing and expanding additional order acquisition, treatment planning and manufacturing operations closer to our international customers in order to improve our operational efficiency and increase doctors' confidence in invisalign clear aligners. in the fourth quarter of 2018, we began fabricating our aligners in our manufacturing facility in ziyang, china, our first aligner fabrication facility outside of juarez, mexico. in the third quarter of 2019, we opened our new order acquisition and treatment facility in wroclaw, poland and new treatment facility in yokohama, japan.
•   corporate structure reorganization. in january 2020, we reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities with the goal of achieving financial and operational efficiencies. as part of this corporate structure reorganization, our emea regional headquarters was moved from amsterdam, the netherlands to rotkreuz, switzerland. as a result, we will continue to incur expenses in the near term and expect to realize the related benefits in subsequent years. the implementation of this reorganization plan has been disruptive to our business, and may not ultimately be more efficient or effective. moreover, our reorganization activities, including any related expenses and the impact from affected employees, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and effective tax rates.
•   expenses. we expect expenses to increase in 2020 due in part to:
▪   investments in manufacturing capacity and facilities to enhance our regional capabilities;
▪   investments in international expansion;
▪   investments in expansion of number of direct sales force personnel;
▪   increase in sales, marketing and customer support resources including our new advertising campaign; and
▪   product and technology innovation to enhance product efficiency and operational productivity.
we believe that these investments will position us to increase our revenues and continue to grow our market share, but will negatively impact results of operations, particularly in the near term.
•   stock repurchases. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we repurchased $200.0 million of our common stock on the open market at an average price of $264.93 per share. we also entered into an accelerated stock repurchase agreement to repurchase $200.0 million of our common stock and received a total of 1.1 million shares for an average share price of $176.61. as of december 31, 2019, we have $100.0 million available for repurchase under the $600.0 million repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in may 2018 (refer to note 12 "common stock repurchase programs" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on our stock repurchase programs).
results of operations net revenues by reportable segment we group our operations into two reportable segments: clear aligner segment and scanner segment.
•   our clear aligner segment consists of comprehensive products, non-comprehensive products and non-case revenues as defined below:
•   comprehensive products include invisalign comprehensive and invisalign first.
•   non-comprehensive products include, but are not limited to, invisalign moderate, lite and express packages and invisalign go, in addition to revenues from the sale of aligners to smiledirectclub ("sdc") under our supply agreement that expired on december 31, 2019.
•   non-case includes, but is not limited to, vivera retainers along with our training and ancillary products for treating malocclusion.
•   our scanner segment consists of intraoral scanning systems, which includes a single hardware platform and restorative or orthodontic software options, additional services and ancillary products. this segment includes our itero scanner and orthocad services.

total net revenues increased by $440.3 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily as a result of invisalign case and scanner volume growth across all regions.
clear aligner - americas americas net revenues increased by $118.8 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to invisalign case volume growth across all channels and products which contributed to the net revenue growth by $100.2 million and higher average selling prices ("asp") which increased net revenues by $18.7 million. higher asp was mainly the result of price increases across most products which increased net revenues by $35.1 million and $23.4 million increase in net revenues driven by a product mix shift towards comprehensive products and less sdc revenues, which carry a lower asp. we no longer manufacture aligners for sdc as our supply agreement with sdc expired by its terms on december 31, 2019. these asp increases were partially offset by a reduction in net revenues of $23.1 million from higher promotional discounts and $17.6 million reduction in net revenues as a result of higher net revenue deferrals and unfavorable foreign exchange rates.
clear aligner - international international net revenues increased by $197.2 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily driven by case volume growth across all channels and products which increased net revenues by $232.5 million. this increase was partially offset by lower asp that reduced net revenues by $35.3 million. the asp decline was mainly the result of higher promotional discounts which reduced net revenues by $45.0 million, unfavorable foreign exchange rates lowered net revenues by $37.2 million, and a product mix shift towards non-comprehensive products reduced net revenues by $19.0 million. these asp decreases were partially offset by a $47.8 million improvement in net revenues related to price increases across most products along with a benefit from going direct in several additional countries, and lower net revenue deferrals and sales credits that increased net revenues by $18.1 million.
clear aligner - non-case non-case net revenues, consisting of vivera retainers, training fees and other product revenues, increased by $18.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to increased vivera volume across all regions.
scanner scanner and services net revenues increased by $106.0 million in 2019 as compared to 2018. this increase is primarily a result of scanner volume growth which increased net revenues by $58.4 million, and higher cad/cam services that increased net revenues by $37.7 million primarily due to a larger install base and increased scanner subscription services. additionally, net revenues increased by $10.0 million due to an improvement in the scanner asp mainly attributable to price increases in several regions.

clear aligner operating margin percentage decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower clear aligner gross margin percentage as a result of an increase in aligners per case combined with impairment charges on operating lease right-of-use assets, store leasehold improvement and other fixed assets. these decreases were partially offset by a gain recognized from the litigation settlement with straumann.
scanner operating margin percentage remained flat in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies and higher asp partially offset by higher operating expenses.

the increase in effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is primarily attributable to tax benefits recorded last year as a result of expiration of statute limitations that did not recur in 2019 and reduced excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation mainly due to non-deductible officers' compensation. for the year ended december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, we recognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes of $1.6 million and $22.5 million, respectively, related to expiration of statute of limitations and $13.4 million and $26.5 million, respectively, related to stock-based compensation.
effective january 1, 2020, as a result of the relocation of our emea regional headquarters from amsterdam, the netherlands to rotkreuz, switzerland, our tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 and for the rest of the year, will reflect a significant one-time tax benefit of up to $1.6 billion associated with the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to the intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual property rights. we continue to assess the realizability of this deferred tax asset as we take into account new information, including the profitability of our swiss headquarters and ongoing communication with the swiss tax authorities.

investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $350.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable securities of $693.3 million, purchases of property, plant and equipment of $149.7 million and other investing activities of $14.7 million. these outflows were partially offset by maturities and sales of marketable securities of $485.4 million and payments of $21.8 million received on an unsecured promissory note issued by sdc in exchange for tendering our shares to them.
for 2020, we expect to invest $180 million to $200 million in capital expenditures related to building purchases and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired (refer to note 10 "commitments and contingencies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on the purchases of buildings in petach tivka, israel and san jose, california).
net cash provided by investing activities was $6.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, which primarily consisted of maturities and sales of our marketable securities of $384.7 million and loan repayment from equity investee of $30.0 million. these inflows were partially offset by purchases property, plant and equipment of $223.3 million, purchases of marketable securities of $180.2 million and purchases of investments in privately held companies of $5.0 million.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $485.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $400.0 million, payroll taxes paid for equity awards through share withholdings of $57.7 million and the purchase of a building that we previously leased under a finance lease of $45.8 million. these outflows were offset in part by $17.9 million proceeds from the issuance of common stock.
net cash used in financing activities was $369.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $300.0 million and payroll taxes of $86.1 million paid for vesting of rsus through share withholdings. these outflows were offset in part by $16.6 million from proceeds from the issuance of common stock.
common stock repurchases refer to note 12 "common stock repurchase programs" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details.
•   april 2016 repurchase program. in 2018, we repurchased approximately $200.0 million of our common stock on the open market, completing the april 2016 repurchase program.
•   may 2018 repurchase program. in may 2018, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a plan to repurchase up to $600.0 million of our common stock. we repurchased $100.0 million and $400.0 million of our common stock in 2018 and 2019, respectively, and as of december 31, 2019, we have $100.0 million remaining under this program.
we believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities combined with our existing borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows and need more funds beyond our available liquid investments and those available under our credit facility, we may need to suspend our stock repurchase programs or seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing, collaborative or other arrangements with other companies, bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations. there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. if adequate funds are not available, we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy, business structure or operations. accordingly, the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
credit facility on february 27, 2018, we entered into a new credit facility for a $200.0 million revolving line of credit, with a $50.0 million letter of credit sublimit, and a maturity date of february 27, 2021. as of december 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility (refer to note 7 "credit facility" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the credit facility).
contractual obligations / off balance sheet arrangements the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2019 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows (in thousands):

1 sublease income is not material and excluded from the table above.
our contractual obligations table above excludes approximately $42.7 million of non-current uncertain tax benefits which are included in other long-term obligations and deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of december 31, 2019. we have not included this amount because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, if any.
as of december 31, 2019, we had additional operating leases that have not yet commenced of $7.9 million. these operating leases will commence between 2020 through 2021 with lease terms of 2 years to 4 years.
we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s-k item 303(a) (4) as of december 31, 2019 other than certain items disclosed in note 10 "commitments and contingencies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
indemnification provisions in the normal course of business to facilitate transactions in our services and products, we indemnify certain parties: customers, vendors, lessors, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, services to be provided by us and intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. in addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and our executive officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.
it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. additionally, we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. however, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. as of december 31, 2019, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements. we evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, goodwill and finite-lived assets and related impairment, and income taxes. we use authoritative pronouncements, historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates. actual results could differ from those estimates.
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. for further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item 8.
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of aligners, scanners, and services from our clear aligner and scanner segments. we enter into sales contracts that may consist of multiple distinct performance obligations where certain performance obligations of the sales contract are not delivered in one reporting period. we measure and allocate revenues according to asc 606-10, "revenues from contracts with customers."
we identify a performance obligation as distinct if both of the following criteria are met: the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. determining the standalone selling price ("ssp"), allocation of consideration from the contract to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition, is the result of significant qualitative and quantitative judgments. while changes in the allocation of the ssp between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenues recognized for a particular contract, any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which would have a material effect on our financial position and result of operations. this is because the contract consideration is allocated to each performance obligation, delivered or undelivered, at the inception of the contract based on the ssp of each distinct performance obligation.
clear aligner we enter into contracts ("treatment plan(s)") that involve multiple future performance obligations. invisalign comprehensive, invisalign first, invisalign moderate, and lite and express packages, include optional additional aligners at no charge for a certain period of time ranging from six months to five years after initial shipment, and invisalign go includes optional additional aligners at no charge for a period of up to two years after initial shipment.
our treatment plans comprise the following performance obligations that also represent distinct deliverables: initial aligners, additional aligners, case refinement, and replacement aligners. we take the practical expedient to consider shipping and handling costs as activities to fulfill the performance obligation. we allocate revenues for each treatment plan based on each unit's ssp. management considers a variety of factors such as historical sales, costs, and gross margin, which may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation in making these estimates. we also consider usage rates, which is the number of times a customer is expected to order additional aligners. our process for estimating usage rates requires significant judgment and evaluation of inputs, including historical usage data by region, country and channel. we recognize the revenues upon shipment, as the customers obtain physical possession and we have enforceable rights to payment. as we collect most consideration upfront, we consider whether a significant financing component exists; however, as the delivery of the performance obligations are at the customer's discretion, we conclude that no significant financing component exists.
scanner we sell intraoral scanners and cad/cam services through both our direct sales force and distribution partners. the intraoral scanner sales price includes one year of warranty and unlimited scanning services. the customer may also select, for additional fees, extended warranty and unlimited scanning services for periods beyond the initial year. when intraoral scanners are sold with an unlimited scanning service agreement and/or extended warranty, we allocate revenues based on the respective ssps of the scanner and the subscription service. we estimate the ssp of each element, taking into consideration historical prices as well as our discounting strategies. revenues are then recognized over time as the monthly services are rendered and upon shipment of the scanner, as that is when we deem the customer to have obtained control. most consideration is collected upfront and in cases where there are payment plans, consideration is collected by the one year mark and, therefore, there are no significant financing components.
volume discounts in certain situations, we offer promotions in which the discount will increase depending upon the volume purchased over time. we concluded that in these situations, the promotions can represent either variable consideration or options, depending upon the specifics of the promotion. in the event the promotion contains an option, the option is considered a material right and, therefore, included in the accounting for the initial arrangement. we estimate the average anticipated discount over the lifetime of the promotion or contract, and apply that discount to each unit as it is sold. on a quarterly basis, we review our estimates and, if needed, updates are made and changes are applied prospectively.
unfulfilled performance obligations for clear aligners and scanners our unfilled performance obligations, including deferred revenues and backlog, as of december 31, 2019 and the estimated revenues expected to be recognized in the future related to these performance obligations are $610.3 million. this includes performance obligations from the clear aligner segment, primarily the shipment of additional aligners, which are fulfilled over six months to five years. also included are the performance obligations from the itero scanner segment, primarily services and support, which are fulfilled over one to five years, and contracted deliveries of additional scanners. the estimate includes both product and service unfulfilled performance obligations and the time range reflects our best estimate of when we will transfer control to the customer and may change based on customer usage patterns, timing of shipments, readiness of customers' facilities for installation, and manufacturing availability.
contract balances the timing of revenue recognition results in deferred revenues being recognized on our consolidated balance sheet. for both aligners and scanners, we usually collect the total consideration owed prior to all performance obligations being performed with payment terms generally varying from net 30 to net 180 days. contract liabilities are recorded as deferred revenue balances, which are generated based upon timing of invoices and recognition patterns, not payments. if the revenue recognition exceeds the billing, the exceeded amount is considered unbilled receivable and a contract asset. conversely, if the billing occurs prior to the revenue recognition, the amount is considered deferred revenue and a contract liability.
goodwill and finite-lived acquired intangible assets and long-lived assets goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the respective reporting units based on relative synergies generated.
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually on november 30th or more frequently if indicators are present, an event occurs or changes in circumstances suggest an impairment may exist and that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. the allocation of goodwill to the respective reporting unit is based on relative synergies generated as a result of an acquisition.
we perform an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. in performing the qualitative assessment, we identify and consider the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that affect the fair value of our reporting units. these factors include external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as our actual and planned financial performance. we also give consideration to the difference between the reporting unit fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed. if, after assessing the totality of relevant events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and there is no indication of impairment, no further testing is performed; however, if we conclude otherwise, the first step of the two-step impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying value, including goodwill. refer to note 6 "goodwill and intangible assets" of notes to consolidated financial statements for details on goodwill.
finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets our intangible assets primarily consist of intangible assets acquired as part of acquisitions and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, reflecting the period in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized.
we evaluate long-lived assets (including finite-lived intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. an asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. if an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair market value. our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our long-lived assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors. factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends, significant loss of customers and changes in the competitive environment. the estimation of fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow approach includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected growth rates and the selection of discount rates, as well as assumptions regarding general economic and business conditions, and the structure that would yield the highest economic value, among other factors. refer to note 6 "goodwill and intangible assets" of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the impairment analysis.
accounting for income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes.
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the applicable tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheet.
we account for uncertainty in income taxes pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit based on its technical merits, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of estimates due to new information. to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statement of operation in the period in which such determination is made.
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot realize our deferred tax assets. we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. if it is more likely than not that we will not realize our deferred tax assets, we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be realized.
the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act includes provisions for certain foreign-sourced earnings referred to as global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") which imposes a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. we have made the election to record gilti tax using the period cost method.

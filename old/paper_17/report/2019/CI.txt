item 1a. risk factors as a large global health service company operating in a complex industry, we encounter a variety of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition or the trading price of our securities. you should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties discussed below, together with other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, including management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition. these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us. the following risk factors have been organized by category for ease of use; however many of the risks may have impacts in more than one category. these categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. risk factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance.
strategic and operational risks future performance of our business will depend on our ability to execute our strategic and operational initiatives effectively.
the future performance of our business will depend in large part on our ability to effectively implement and execute our strategic and operational initiatives. successfully executing on these initiatives depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:
•differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors;
•develop and introduce new and innovative products, solutions or programs that focus on improving patient outcomes and assist in controlling costs or are in response to government regulation and the increased focus on consumer-directed products;
•grow our product portfolio and identify and introduce the proper mix or integration of products that will be accepted by the marketplace;
•evaluate drugs for efficacy, value and price to assist clients in selecting a cost-effective formulary;
•offer cost-effective home delivery pharmacy and specialty services;
•access or continue accessing key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories in our specialty business;
•leverage purchase volume to deliver discounts to health benefit providers;
•attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees;
•attract, develop and maintain collaborative relationships with a sufficient number of qualified partners;
•attract new and maintain existing customer and client relationships;
•transition health care providers from volume-based fee-for-service arrangements to a value-based system;
•improve medical cost competitiveness in our targeted markets;
•manage our medical, pharmacy, administrative, and other operating costs effectively; and
•contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmacy providers on favorable terms.
for our strategic initiatives to succeed, we must effectively integrate our operations, including with express scripts and other acquired businesses, actively work to ensure consistency throughout the organization, and promote a global mind-set along with a focus on individual customers and clients. if we fail to do so, our business may be unable to grow as planned, or the result of expansion may be unsatisfactory. we will be unable to rapidly respond to competitive, economic and regulatory changes if we do not make important strategic and operational decisions quickly, define our appetite for risk, implement new governance, managerial and organizational processes smoothly and communicate roles and responsibilities clearly. if these initiatives fail or are not executed effectively, our consolidated financial position and results of operations could be negatively affected.
31
we operate in a highly competitive, evolving and rapidly changing industry and our failure to adapt could negatively impact our business.
the health service industry continues to be dynamic and rapidly evolving. any significant shifts in the structure of the industry could alter industry dynamics and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain clients and customers. industry shifts could result (and have resulted) from, among other things:
•a large intra- or inter-industry merger or industry consolidation;
•strategic alliances;
•new or alternative business models;
•continuing consolidation among physicians, hospitals and other health care providers, as well as changes in the organizational structures chosen by physicians, hospitals and health care providers;
•new market entrants, including those not traditionally in the health service industry;
•the ability of larger employers and clients to contract directly with providers;
•technological changes and rapid shifts in the use of technology, such as telemedicine;
•the impact or consequences of legislation or regulatory changes;
•changes in the united states postal service or the consolidation of shipping carriers;
•increased drug acquisition cost or unexpected changes to drug pricing trend;
•change in the generic drug market or the failure of new generic drugs to come to market;
•a change in drug utilization; or
•a change in utilization under risk-based contracts in the health benefit management market.
our failure to anticipate or appropriately adapt to changes in the industry could negatively impact our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
our failure to compete effectively to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors and maintain or increase market share could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
we operate in a highly competitive environment and an industry subject to significant market pressures brought about by customer and client needs, legislative and regulatory developments and other market factors. in particular markets, our competitors may have greater, better or more established capabilities, resources, market share, reputation or business relationships, or lower profit margin or financial return expectations. our clients are well informed and organized and can easily move between our competitors and us. our express scripts client contracts generally have three-year terms. as described in greater detail in the description of our business in item 1 of this form 10-k, one of our key clients in the health services segment is the united states department of defense. if one or more of our large clients terminates or does not renew a contract for any reason, including as a result of being acquired, or if the provisions of a contract with a large client are modified, renewed or otherwise changed with terms less favorable to us, our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could experience a negative reaction in the investment community resulting in decreases in the trading price of our securities or other adverse effects.
our success depends, in part, on our ability to compete effectively in our markets, set prices appropriately in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share, increase customers as planned, differentiate our business offerings by innovating and delivering products and services that provide enhanced value to our customers, provide quality and satisfactory levels of service, and retain accounts with favorable medical cost experience or more profitable products versus retaining or increasing our customer base in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience or less profitable products.
we must remain competitive to attract new customers, retain existing customers, and further integrate additional product and service offerings. to succeed in this highly competitive marketplace, it is imperative that we maintain a strong reputation. the negative
32
reputational impact of a significant event, including a failure to execute on customer or client contracts or strategic or operational initiatives, failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or failure to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate greater value to our customers, could affect our ability to grow and retain profitable arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
we face price competition and other pressures that could compress our margins or result in premiums that are insufficient to cover the cost of services delivered to our customers.
while we compete on the basis of many service and quality-related factors, we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. our client contracts are subject to negotiation as clients seek to contain their costs, including by reducing benefits offered. increasingly, our clients seek to negotiate performance guarantees that require us to pay penalties if the guaranteed performance standard is not met. clients can easily move between our competitors and us. our clients are well informed and typically have knowledgeable consultants that seek competing bids from our competitors before contract renewal. in addition, as brokers and benefit consultants seek to enhance their revenue streams, they look to take on services that we typically provide. each of these events could negatively impact our financial results.
further, federal and state regulatory agencies may restrict our ability to implement changes in premium rates. fiscal or other concerns related to the government-sponsored programs in which we participate, such as medicare, may cause decreasing reimbursement rates, delays in premium payments, restrictions on implementing changes in premium rates or insufficient increases in reimbursement rates. any limitation on our ability to maintain or increase our premium or reimbursement levels, or a significant loss of customers or clients resulting from our need to increase or maintain premium or reimbursement levels, could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
premiums in the integrated medical segment are generally set for one-year periods and are priced well in advance of the date on which the contract commences or renews. our revenue on individual and family plans ("ifp") and medicare policies is based on bids submitted midyear in the year before the contract year. although we base the premiums we charge and our ifp and medicare bids on our estimate of future health care costs over the contract period, actual costs may exceed what we estimate in setting premiums. our health care costs also are affected by external events that we cannot forecast or project and over which we have little or no control, as well as changes in customers' health care utilization patterns and provider billing practices. our profitability depends, in part, on our ability to accurately predict, price for and effectively manage future health care costs. relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenue can result in significant changes in our financial results.
strong competition within the pharmacy benefit business has also generated greater demand for lower product and service pricing, increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offerings. these competitive factors have historically applied pressure on our operating margins and caused many companies, including us, to reduce the prices charged for products and services while sharing with clients a greater portion of the formulary fees and related rebates received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. our inability to maintain positive trends, or failure to identify and implement new ways to mitigate pricing pressures, could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain clients or sell additional services, which could negatively impact our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
the reserves we hold for expected medical claims are based on estimates that involve an extensive degree of judgment and are inherently variable. if actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating results could be materially adversely affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to contain future costs may be limited.
we maintain and record medical claims reserves on our balance sheet for estimated future payments. our estimates of health care costs payable are based on a number of factors, including historical claim experience, but this estimation process requires extensive judgment. considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, and the accuracy of the estimates is highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and processing patterns or procedures, changes in customer base and product mix, changes in the utilization of prescription drugs, medical or other covered items or services, changes in medical cost trends, changes in our health management practices and the introduction of new benefits and products. if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends, our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited. additionally, we must estimate the amount of rebates payable by us under the aca's and cms's minimum loss ratio rules and the amounts payable by us to, and receivable by us from, the united states federal government under the aca's remaining premium stabilization program. because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing reserves.
33
if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals and other health service providers and with producers and consultants, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
we contract with or employ physicians, hospitals and other health service providers and facilities to provide health services to our customers. our results of operations are substantially dependent on our ability to contract for these services at competitive prices. in any particular market, physicians, hospitals and health service providers may enter into exclusive arrangements with competitors or simply refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or less desirable products or services for our customers. in some markets, certain providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations and multispecialty physician groups, may have significant or controlling market positions that could result in a diminished bargaining position for us. if providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate more favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially adversely affected. establishing collaborative arrangements with physician groups, specialist groups, independent practice associations, hospitals and health care delivery systems is key to our strategic focus to transition from volume-based fee-for-service arrangements to a value-based health care system. if such collaborative arrangements do not result in the lower medical costs that we project or if we fail to attract health care providers to such arrangements, or are less successful at implementing such arrangements than our competitors, our attractiveness to customers may be reduced and our ability to profitably grow our business may be adversely affected.
our ability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with providers may also be negatively impacted by other factors not associated with us, such as changes in medicare or medicaid reimbursement levels, increasing pressure on revenue and other pressures on health care providers and increasing consolidation activity among hospitals, physician groups and providers. continuing consolidation among physicians, hospitals and other providers, the emergence of accountable care organizations, vertical integration of providers and other entities, changes in the organizational structures chosen by physicians, hospitals and providers and new market entrants, including those not traditionally in the health care industry, may affect the way providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape in which we operate. in some instances, these organizations may compete directly with us, potentially affecting the way we price our products and services or causing us to incur increased costs if we change our operations to be more competitive.
out-of-network providers are not limited by any agreement with us in the amounts they bill. while benefit plans place limits on the amount of charges that will be considered for reimbursement and state regulations seek to establish methodologies and dispute resolution processes, out-of-network providers are increasingly sophisticated and aggressive. as a result, the outcome of disputes where we do not have a provider contract may cause us to pay higher medical or other benefit costs than we projected.
additionally, certain of our products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we compete. our sales could be materially adversely affected if we were are unable to attract, retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels.
if we lose our relationship with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers, or if the payments made or discounts provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
we maintain contractual relationships with numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers, which provide us with, among other things:
•discounts for drugs we purchase to be dispensed from our home delivery and specialty pharmacies;
•discounts, in the form of rebates, for drug utilization;
•fees for administering rebate programs, including invoicing, allocating and collecting rebates;
•fees for services provided to pharmaceutical manufacturers by our specialty pharmacies; and
•access to limited distribution specialty pharmaceuticals by our specialty pharmacies.
our contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers are typically nonexclusive and terminable on relatively short notice by either party. the consolidation of pharmaceutical manufacturers, the termination or material alteration of our contractual relationships, or our failure to renew such contracts on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. in addition, arrangements between payors and pharmaceutical manufacturers have been the subject of debate in federal and state legislatures and various other public and governmental forums. adoption of new laws, rules or regulations or changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, rules or regulations, relating to any of these programs could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
34
if significant changes occur within the pharmacy provider marketplace, or if other issues arise with respect to our pharmacy networks, including the loss of or adverse change in our relationship with one or more key pharmacy providers, our business and financial results could be impaired.
more than 67,700 retail pharmacies, which represent over 99% of all united states retail pharmacies, participated in one or more of our networks as of december 31, 2019. the ten largest retail pharmacy chains represent approximately 65% of the total number of stores in our largest network. in certain geographic areas of the united states, our networks may be comprised of higher concentrations of one or more large pharmacy chains. contracts with retail pharmacies are generally nonexclusive and are terminable on relatively short notice by either party. if one or more of the larger pharmacy chains terminates its relationship with us, or is able to renegotiate terms substantially less favorable to us, our customers' access to retail pharmacies or our business could be materially adversely affected. the entry of one or more additional large pharmacy chains into the pharmacy benefit management business, the consolidation of existing pharmacy chains or increased leverage or market share by the largest pharmacy providers could increase the likelihood of negative changes in our relationship with such pharmacies. changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks, or reduced pharmacy access under our networks, could have a negative impact on our claims volume or our competitiveness in the marketplace, which could cause us to fall short of certain guarantees in our contracts with clients or otherwise impair our business or results of operations.
changes in drug pricing or industry pricing benchmarks could materially impact our financial performance.
contracts in the prescription drug industry, including our contracts with retail pharmacy networks and our pharmacy and specialty pharmacy clients, generally use pricing metrics published by third parties as benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs. if these benchmarks are no longer published by third parties, we, or our contractual partners, adopt other pricing benchmarks for establishing prices within the industry, legislation or regulation requires the use of other pricing benchmarks, or future changes in drug prices substantially deviate from our expectations, the short- or long-term impacts may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
as a global company, we face political, legal, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks that present challenges and could negatively affect our multinational operations or our long-term growth.
as a global company, our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations. these risks can vary substantially by market, and include political, legal, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks, including government intervention that we do not face in our u.s. operations. the global nature of our business and operations may present challenges including, but not limited to, those arising from:
•geopolitical business conditions and demands, including the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union;
•regulation that may discriminate against u.s. companies, favor nationalization or expropriate assets;
•price controls or other pricing issues and exchange controls; restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds out of the countries in which we operate; foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations and restrictions on converting currencies from foreign operations into other currencies; uncertainty with respect to the interpretation of tax positions;
•reliance on local employees and interpretations of labor laws in foreign jurisdictions;
•managing our partner relationships in countries outside of the united states;
•providing data protection on a global basis and sufficient levels of technical support in different locations;
•the global trend for companies to enact local data residency requirements;
•acts of civil unrest, war, terrorism, natural disasters or pandemics, such as the recent coronavirus outbreak, in locations where we operate; and
•general economic and political conditions.
these factors may increase in significance as we continue to expand globally and operating in new foreign markets may require considerable management time before operations generate any significant revenues and earnings. any one of these challenges could negatively affect our operations or long-term growth. for example, due to the concentration of our international business in south korea, the international markets segment is exposed to potential losses resulting from economic and regulatory changes in that
35
country and the geopolitical climate in the korean peninsula, as well as foreign currency movements affecting the south korean currency, that could have a significant impact on the segment's results and our consolidated financial results.
international operations also require us to devote significant resources to implement controls and systems in new markets to comply with, and to ensure that our vendors and partners comply with, u.s. and foreign laws prohibiting bribery, corruption and money laundering, in addition to other regulations regarding, among other things, our products, direct-to-consumer communications, customer privacy, data protection and data residency. violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business and significant reputational harm. our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges. our failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to establish constructive relations with non-u.s. regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and long-term growth.
strategic transactions, including our acquisition of express scripts, involve risks and we may not realize the expected benefits because of integration difficulties, underperformance relative to our expectations and other challenges.
as part of our strategy, we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing arrangements, divestitures and other relationships (collectively referred to as "strategic transactions"). there is significant competition for attractive targets and opportunities and we may be unable to identify and successfully complete strategic transactions in the future. in addition, from time to time, we evaluate alternatives for our businesses that do not meet our strategic, growth or profitability objectives, and we may divest or wind down such businesses. we may be unable to complete any such divestiture on terms favorable to us, within the expected timeframes, or at all. we may have continued financial exposure to divested businesses following the completion of any such transaction, including increased costs due to potential litigation, contingent liabilities and indemnification of the buyer related to, among other things, lawsuits, regulatory matters or tax liabilities.
our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of strategic transactions is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including our ability to integrate or separate operations, resources and systems, including data security systems, in an efficient and effective manner. for example, the continued success of the express scripts acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to successfully combine the businesses of cigna and express scripts and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies, from the combination.
key risks of the express scripts integration include, but are not limited to, retaining existing clients and attracting new clients on profitable terms; maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and realizing operational synergies; integrating information technology, communications programs, financial procedures and operations, and other systems, procedures and policies; coordinating geographically separate organizations; and on-going modifications to internal financial control standards.
integration and separation activities may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits, including with respect to the express scripts integration, may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected. these activities are complex, costly and time-consuming and may divert management's attention from ongoing business concerns. delays or issues encountered in these activities could have a material adverse effect on the revenues, expenses, operating results and financial condition of the combined company.
strategic transactions could result in increased costs, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and costs to retain key employees, decreases in expected revenues, earnings or cash flows, and goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges. additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of express scripts' businesses. although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of those businesses, should allow us to more than offset incremental transaction and merger-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. as of december 31, 2019, our goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of approximately $81 billion, representing 52% of our total consolidated assets. the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if the businesses we acquire do not perform in a manner consistent with our assumptions. future evaluations requiring an impairment to goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders' equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. a material decrease in shareholders' equity could negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants. in addition, the trading price of our securities may decline if, among other things, we are unable to achieve our estimates of earnings growth and operational cost savings, or the transaction costs related to the acquisition and integration are greater than expected. the trading price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts.
additionally, joint ventures and equity investments present risks that are different from acquisitions, including risks related to: specific operations and finances of the businesses we invest in, selection of appropriate parties, differing objectives of the various
36
parties, competition between and among parties, compliance activities (including compliance with applicable cms requirements), growing the business in a manner acceptable to all the parties, maintaining positive relationships among the parties, clients and customers, initial and ongoing governance of joint ventures, and customer and business disruption that may occur upon a joint venture termination.
further, we may finance strategic transactions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price that could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders, or by incurring additional debt that could increase costs and impact our ability to access capital in the future.
in addition, effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to mitigate the risk of fraud. the integration of businesses is likely to cause increasing complexity in our systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage. any difficulties in assimilating businesses into our control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. we also rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of joint venture entities and other entities in which we invest and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us. ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information that could negatively impact the trading price of our securities and our access to capital.
we are dependent on the success of our relationships with third parties for various services and functions.
to improve operating costs, productivity and efficiencies, we contract with third parties for the provision of specific services. our operations may be adversely affected if a third party fails to satisfy its obligations to us, if the arrangement is terminated in whole or in part or if there is a contractual dispute between us and the third party. even though contracts are intended to provide certain protections, we have limited control over the actions of third parties. for example, noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations, any security breach involving one of our third-party vendors or a dispute between us and a third-party vendor related to our arrangement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation.
outsourcing also may require us to change our existing operations, adopt new processes for managing these service providers or redistribute responsibilities to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies. if there are delays or difficulties in changing business processes or our third-party vendors do not perform as expected, we may not realize, or not realize on a timely basis, the anticipated economic and other benefits of these relationships. this could result in additional costs or regulatory compliance issues or create other operational or financial problems for us. terminating or transitioning, in whole or in part, arrangements with key vendors could result in additional costs or penalties, risks of operational delays or potential errors and control issues during the termination or transition phase. we may not be able to find an alternative vendor in a timely manner or on acceptable terms. if there is an interruption in business or loss of access to data resulting from a security breach, termination or transition in services, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and, in turn, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
a significant disruption in service within our operations or among our key suppliers or other third parties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions, such as claims processing and payment, internet support and customer call centers, data centers and corporate facilities, processing new and renewal business, maintaining appropriate shipment and storage conditions for prescriptions (such as temperature and protection from contamination) and home delivery processing. in some instances, our ability to provide services or products (including processing and dispensing prescriptions) depends on the availability of services and products provided by suppliers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, vendors or shipping carriers. a disruption in our supply chain, including, as a result of the recent coronavirus outbreak, or inability to access or deliver products that meet requisite quality safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our business. additionally, any failure or disruption of our performance of, or our ability to perform, key business functions, including through unavailability or cyberattack of our information technology systems or those of third parties, could cause slower response times, decreased levels of service satisfaction and harm to our reputation. our information technology and other systems interface with and depend on third-party systems and we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. our failure to implement adequate business continuity and disaster recovery strategies could significantly reduce our ability to provide products and services to our customers and clients, which could have material adverse effects on our business and results of operations.
37
our business depends on our ability to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems.
our business is highly dependent on maintaining effective information systems as well as the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our customers and health care providers and to operate our business. if our data were found to be inaccurate or unreliable due to fraud or other error, or if we, or any of the third-party service providers we engage, were to fail to maintain information systems and data integrity effectively, we could experience operational disruptions that may impact our clients, customers and health care providers and hinder our ability to provide services and products, establish appropriate pricing for products and services, retain and attract clients and customers, establish reserves and report financial results timely and accurately and maintain regulatory compliance, among other things.
our information technology strategy and execution are critical to our continued success. we must continue to invest in long-term solutions that will enable us to anticipate customer needs and expectations, enhance the customer experience, act as a differentiator in the market and protect against cybersecurity risks and threats. our success is dependent, in large part, on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and continuing to deliver and enhance technology systems that support our business processes in a cost-efficient and resource-efficient manner. increasing regulatory and legislative changes will place additional demands on our information technology infrastructure that could have a direct impact on resources available for other projects tied to our strategic initiatives. in addition, recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important. we must also develop new systems to meet current market standards and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and customer needs. failure to do so may present compliance challenges and impede our ability to deliver services in a competitive manner. further, because system development projects are long term in nature, they may be more costly than expected to complete and may not deliver the expected benefits upon completion. our failure to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flow.
as a large health service company, we are subject to cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents. if we are unable to prevent or contain the effects of any such attacks, we may suffer exposure to substantial liability, reputational harm, loss of revenue or other damages.
our business depends on our clients' and customers' willingness to entrust us with their health-related and other sensitive personal information. computer systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses or malware, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. we have been, and will likely continue to be, the target of computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyberattacks or other computer-related penetrations. there have been, and will likely continue to be, large scale cyberattacks within the health service industry. additionally, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design, manufacturer defects or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information technology. human or technological error has and could in the future result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third-party data or systems; theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks or other means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service.
as we increase the amount of personal information that we store and share digitally, our exposure to unintended disclosures, data security and related cybersecurity risks increases, including the risk of undetected attacks, damage, loss or unauthorized access or misappropriation of proprietary or personal information, and the cost of attempting to protect against these risks also increases. if disruptions, disclosures or breaches are not detected quickly, their effect could be compounded. we have implemented security technologies, processes and procedures to protect consumer identity and provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware and other cyber risks; however, there are no assurances that such measures will be effective against all types of breaches.
cybersecurity threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to our proprietary systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated. cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including third parties, such as external service providers, and the techniques used change frequently or are often not recognized until after they have been launched. those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. in addition, while we have certain standards for all vendors that provide us services, our vendors, and in turn, their own service providers, may become subject to the same types of security breaches. finally, our offices may be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, misplaced or lost data, human error or similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our customers' and clients' data.
38
the costs to eliminate or address security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers.
in addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information, proprietary information or confidential information about us, our customers or other third parties could expose our customers' private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft. unauthorized dissemination of confidential and proprietary information about our business and strategy could also negatively affect the achievement of our strategic initiatives. such events could cause us to breach our contractual confidentiality obligations and violate applicable laws. these events would negatively affect our ability to compete, others' trust in us, our reputation, customer base and revenues and expose us to mandatory disclosure requirements, litigation and other enforcement proceedings, material fines, penalties or remediation costs, and compensatory, special, punitive and statutory damages, consent orders and other adverse actions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
in managing medical practices and operating pharmacies, onsite clinics and other types of medical facilities, we may be subject to additional liability that could result in significant time and expense.
in addition to contracting with physicians and other health care providers for services, we employ physicians, pharmacists, nurses and other health care providers at our home delivery and specialty pharmacies, onsite low acuity and primary care practices and infusion clinics that we manage and operate for our customers, as well as certain clinics for our employees. we also provide in-home care through health care providers that we employ, as well as, through third-party contractors. as such, we may be subject to liability for certain acts, omissions, or injuries caused by our employees or agents, or occurring at one of these practices, pharmacies or clinics. the defense of any actions may result in significant expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation.
legal and compliance risks our business is subject to substantial government regulation, as well as new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
our business is regulated at the federal, state, local and international levels. the laws and rules governing our business and related interpretations are increasing in number and complexity, are subject to frequent change and can be inconsistent or in conflict with each other. noncompliance with applicable regulations by us or our third-party vendors could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation.
we must identify, assess and respond to new trends in the legislative and regulatory environment, as well as comply with the various existing regulations applicable to our business. there are currently pending, and in the future there will likely be, legislative or regulatory proposals which seek to manage the health care industry, including managing prescription drug costs and health records, as well as regulating drug distribution. we expect federal and state governments to continue to enact and seriously consider many broad-based legislative and regulatory proposals that will or could materially impact various aspects of the health care and related benefits system. the trading price of our securities may react to the announcement of such proposals. we are unable to predict whether any such proposals will be enacted, or the specific terms thereof, including their effect on our operations; however, certain of these proposals could, if enacted, adversely impact our business and results of operations.
existing or future laws, rules, regulatory interpretations or judgments could force us to change how we conduct our business, affect the products and services we offer, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our costs, including operating, health care technology and administrative costs, and require enhancements to our compliance infrastructure and internal controls environment. for example, a decision invalidating the aca or portions thereof could result in material changes to the way we conduct our business, as well as the loss of subsidies related to our ifp offerings. we are required to obtain and maintain insurance and other regulatory approvals to, among other things, market many of our products, expand into additional geographic or product markets, increase prices for certain regulated products and consummate some of our acquisitions and dispositions. delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs. existing or future laws and rules could also require or lead us to take other actions such as changing our business practices, and could increase our liability.
further, failure to effectively implement or adjust our strategic and operational initiatives, such as by reducing operating costs, adjusting premium pricing or benefit design or transforming our business model in response to regulatory changes may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, including, but not limited to, our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.

there are various risks associated with participating in government-sponsored programs, such as medicare, including dependence upon government funding, compliance with government contracts and increased regulatory oversight and enforcement.
through our government business, we contract with cms and various state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services including medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans. additionally, our health services business provides services to government entities and payers participating in government health care programs.
our revenues from government funded programs, including our medicare programs and our government clients, are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government or applicable state or local governments. funding for these programs is dependent on many factors outside our control, including general economic conditions, continuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issues and priorities. these entities generally have the right to not renew or cancel their contracts with us on short notice without cause or if funds are not available. unanticipated changes in funding, such as the application of sequestration by the federal or state governments or the failure to provide for continued appropriations or regular ongoing scheduled payments to us, could substantially reduce our revenues and profitability.
the medicare program has been the subject of regulatory reform initiatives. the premium rates paid to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans are established by contract, although the rates differ depending on a combination of factors, some of which are outside our control. for example, a portion of each medicare advantage plan's reimbursement is tied to the plan's star rating, with those plans receiving a rating of four or more stars eligible for quality-based bonus payments. a plan's star rating affects its image in the market and plans that perform well are able to offer enhanced benefits, market more effectively and for longer periods of time than other plans. the star rating system is subject to change annually by cms, which may make it more difficult to achieve four stars or greater. our medicare advantage plans' and medicare part d plans' operating results, premium revenue and benefit offerings are likely to continue to be significantly determined by their star ratings. there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years. in addition, audits of our performance for past or future periods may result in downgrades to our star ratings. accordingly, our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses, which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer, reduce membership or impact our financial performance. see part ii, item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of information - industry developments and other matters affecting our health services and integrated medical segments for additional information on our star ratings.
additionally, if we fail to comply with cms's contractual requirements, including data submission, enrollment and marketing, provider network adequacy, provider directory accuracy, quality measures, claims payment, continuity of care and call center performance, we may be subject to administrative actions, including enrollment sanctions or contract termination, fines or other penalties that could impact our profitability. as described under "business - regulation" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k, on november 1, 2018, cms released a proposed rule that would revise its radv methodology by, among other things, excluding an adjustment for underlying fee-for-service data errors and extrapolating radv results at the contract level for radv audits of contract year 2011 and all subsequent years. if adopted in its current form, the rule could result in some combination of degraded plan benefits, higher monthly premiums or reduced choice for the population served by all medicare advantage insurers. the company, along with other medicare advantage organizations and additional interested parties, submitted comments to cms on the proposed rule as part of the notice-and-comment rulemaking process. the comment period concluded on august 28, 2019. while it is uncertain that cms will finalize the rule as proposed, if adopted, it could have a material impact on the company's future results of operations.
our participation in health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers through our ifp offerings involves uncertainties associated with mix and volume of business and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. the executive order signed in october 2017 that halted payment of the cost-sharing reduction subsidies under the aca has created additional uncertainty regarding the future of public health insurance exchanges.
any failure to comply with various state and federal health care laws and regulations, including those directed at preventing fraud and abuse in government funded programs, could result in investigations or litigation, such as actions under the federal false claims act and similar whistleblower statutes under state laws. this could subject us to damage awards, including treble damages, fines, penalties or other enforcement actions, restrictions on our ability to market or enroll new customers, limits on expansion, restrictions or exclusions from programs or other agreements with federal or state governmental agencies, which could adversely impact our business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.
40
we face risks related to litigation, regulatory audits and investigations.
we are routinely involved in numerous claims, lawsuits, regulatory audits, investigations and other legal matters arising, for the most part, in the ordinary course of business. these legal matters could include benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, claims arising from consumer protection laws, false claims act laws, claims disputes under federal or state laws and disputes regarding reinsurance arrangements, employment and employment discrimination-related suits, antitrust claims, employee benefit claims, wage and hour claims, tax, privacy, intellectual property and whistleblower claims, shareholder suits and other securities law claims, real estate disputes, claims related to disclosure of certain business practices and claims arising from customer audits and contract performance, including government contracts. in addition, we have incurred and likely will continue to incur liability for practices and claims related to our health care business, such as marketing misconduct, failure to timely or appropriately pay for or provide health care, provider network structure, poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged, provider disputes including disputes over compensation or contractual provisions, erisa claims, allegations related to calculations of cost sharing and claims related to our administration of self-funded business. we are also routinely involved in legal matters arising from our health services business, including without limitation claims related to the dispensing of pharmaceutical products by our home delivery and specialty pharmacies, pharmacy benefit management services, such as formulary management services, health benefit management services and provider services. there are currently, and may be in the future, attempts to bring class action lawsuits against the company and other companies in our industry; individual plaintiffs also may bring multiple claims regarding the same subject matter against us and other companies in our industry.
court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. in some cases, substantial noneconomic or punitive damages may be sought. we seek to procure insurance coverage to cover some of these potential liabilities. however, certain potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may be insufficient to cover the entire damages awarded. in addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. resolving disputes is often expensive and disruptive, regardless of the outcome. additionally, it is possible that the resolution of current or future legal matters and claims could result in changes to our industry and business practices, losses material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity or damage to our reputation.
we are frequently the subject of regulatory market conduct and other reviews, audits and investigations by state insurance and health and welfare and pharmacy departments, attorneys general, cms, dol and the oig and comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. with respect to our medicare advantage and medicare part d businesses, cms and oig perform audits to determine a health plan's compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations, including compliance with proper coding practices and fraud and abuse enforcement practices through audits designed to detect and correct improper payments. certain of our contracts are currently subject to radv audits by cms and the oig. the doj is conducting an industry-wide investigation of the risk adjustment data submission practices and business processes, including review of medical charts, of cigna and a number of other medicare advantage organizations under medicare parts c and d. there also continues to be heightened review by federal and state regulators of business and reporting practices within the health service, disability and life insurance industries, including with respect to claims payment and related escheat practices, and increased scrutiny by other federal and state governmental agencies (such as state attorneys general) empowered to bring criminal actions in circumstances that could have previously given rise only to civil or administrative proceedings.
in addition, various government agencies have conducted investigations and audits into certain pharmacy benefit management practices. many of these investigations and audits have resulted in other companies agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and corporate integrity agreements. we cannot predict what effect, if any, such government investigations and audits may ultimately have on us or on the industry in general. however, we will likely continue to experience government scrutiny and audit activity, which has and may in the future result in civil penalties.
regulatory audits, investigations or reviews or actions by other government agencies could result in changes to our business practices, retroactive adjustments to certain premiums, significant fines, penalties, civil liabilities, criminal liabilities or other sanctions, including corporate integrity agreements, restrictions on our ability to participate in government programs, market certain products or engage in business-related activities, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and liquidity. in addition, disclosure of an adverse investigation or audit or the imposition of fines or other sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in certain markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services.
a description of material pending legal actions and other legal and regulatory matters is included in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k. the outcome of litigation and other legal or regulatory matters is always uncertain.
41
if we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected.
most of our activities involve the receipt, use, storage or transmission of a substantial amount of individuals' protected health information and personally identifiable information. we also use aggregated and anonymized data for research and analysis purposes, and in some cases, provide access to such data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and third-party data aggregators and analysts. the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with clients. in some cases, such laws, rules, regulations and contractual requirements also apply to our vendors and require us to obtain written assurances of their compliance with such requirements. we are also subject to various other consumer protection laws that regulate our communications with customers. certain of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard, which is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities. international laws, rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of such information, such as the gdpr, can be more stringent than in the united states, and they vary across jurisdictions. in addition, more jurisdictions are regulating the transfer of data across borders and domestic privacy and data protection laws are generally becoming more onerous.
these laws, rules and contractual requirements are subject to change and the regulatory environment surrounding data security and privacy is increasingly demanding. compliance with new privacy, security and data laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. for more information on privacy regulations to which we are subject, see "business - regulation" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k.
hipaa requires covered entities to comply with the hipaa privacy, security and breach rules. in addition, business associates must comply with the hipaa security and breach requirements. while we endeavor to provide appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain sensitive personal information in order to provide services to these customers. hhs has continued its audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities and has expanded it to include business associates. in addition, hhs continues to exercise its enforcement authority, such as enforcement actions resulting from investigations brought on by notification to hhs of a breach. an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance or the implementation of an enforcement action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and reputation.
noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could materially adversely affect our business and reputation, including our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
effective prevention, detection and control systems are critical to maintain regulatory compliance and prevent fraud and failure of these systems could adversely affect us.
federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud and abuse a priority. fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of customers, billing for unnecessary medical services, improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights. the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to us are complex and subject to change. in addition, ongoing vigorous law enforcement, a highly technical regulatory scheme and the dodd-frank act and related regulations enhance regulators' enforcement powers and whistleblower incentives and protections. our compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources. failure of our prevention, detection or control systems related to regulatory compliance or the failure of employees to comply with our internal policies including data systems security or unethical conduct by managers and employees, could adversely affect our reputation and also expose us to litigation and other proceedings, fines and penalties.
in addition, provider or customer fraud that is not prevented or detected could impact our medical costs or those of our self-insured clients. further, during an economic downturn, we may experience increased fraudulent claims volume that may lead to additional costs due to an increase in disputed claims and litigation.
economic risks economic and market conditions affect the value of our financial instruments and the value of particular assets and liabilities.
as an insurer, we have substantial investment assets that support insurance and contractholder deposit liabilities. the market value of our investments vary depending on economic and market conditions. for example, generally low levels of interest rates on
42
investments, such as those experienced in u.s. and foreign financial markets during recent years, have negatively impacted our level of investment income earned in recent periods.
a substantial portion of our investment assets are in fixed interest-yielding debt securities of varying maturities, fixed redeemable preferred securities and commercial mortgage loans. the value of these investment assets can fluctuate significantly with changes in market conditions. a rise in interest rates would likely reduce the value of our investment portfolio and increase interest expense if we were to access our available lines of credit. in addition, a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers, could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments.
significant stock market or interest rate declines could result in additional unfunded pension obligations resulting in the need for additional plan funding by us and increased pension expenses.
we currently have unfunded obligations in our frozen pension plans. a significant decline in the value of the plans' equity and fixed income investments or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially increase our expenses and change the timing and amount of required plan funding. this could reduce the cash available to us, including our subsidiaries. we are also exposed to interest rate and equity risk associated with our pension obligations. sustained declines in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the funded status of our pension plans and our reinvestment yield on new investments. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our obligations under the pension plans.
a downgrade in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect new sales and retention of current business, and a downgrade in our debt ratings would increase the cost of borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to access capital.
financial strength, claims paying ability and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are each important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance and health benefits companies. ratings information by nationally recognized ratings agencies is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. we believe that the claims paying ability and financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries are important factors in marketing our products to certain customers. our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. each of the rating agencies reviews ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. a downgrade of any of these ratings in the future could make it more difficult to either market our products successfully or raise capital to support business growth within our insurance subsidiaries.
global market, economic and geopolitical conditions may cause fluctuations in equity market prices, interest rates and credit spreads that could impact our ability to raise or deploy capital and affect our overall liquidity.
if the equity and credit markets experience extreme volatility and disruption, there could be downward pressure on stock prices and restricted access to capital for certain issuers without regard to those issuers' underlying financial strength. extreme disruption in the credit markets could adversely impact our access to, and cost of, capital in the future.
in the event of adverse economic and industry conditions, we may be required to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds we have available for other purposes, such as investments and other expenditures in ongoing businesses, acquisitions, dividends and stock repurchases. in these circumstances, our ability to execute our strategy may be limited, our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in business and market conditions may be reduced, or our access to capital markets may be limited such that additional capital may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.
in connection with the combination with express scripts, we have considerably higher levels of indebtedness than cigna and express scripts previously carried, which will result in higher relative debt service costs and less cash flow from operations available to fund growth, stock repurchases and other corporate purposes.
the long-term indebtedness of cigna was approximately $31.9 billion as of december 31, 2019. this level of indebtedness:
•requires us to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to debt payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, pursue other acquisitions or investments in new technologies, make stock repurchases, pay dividends and for general corporate purposes;
•increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions, including increases in interest rates for our borrowings that bear interest at variable rates and are in a greater amount than floating rate assets held, or if such indebtedness is refinanced at a time when interest rates are higher; and
43
•limits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry.
the covenants to which we have agreed in connection with the financing, and our indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio in comparison with that of cigna or express scripts on a recent historical basis, may have the effect, among other things, of restricting our financial and operating flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, creating competitive disadvantages compared with other competitors with lower debt levels during the deleveraging process. if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations, we may be forced to seek additional dividends from our subsidiaries, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt.
unfavorable developments in economic conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
many factors, including geopolitical issues, future economic downturns, availability and cost of credit and other capital and consumer spending can negatively impact the u.s. and global economies. our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the impact of unfavorable economic conditions on our clients and customers (both employers and individuals), health care providers, pharmacy manufacturers, pharmacy providers and third-party vendors. for example:
•employers may take action to reduce their operating costs by modifying, delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products or making changes in the mix of products purchased that are unfavorable to us.
•higher unemployment rates and workforce reductions could result in lower enrollment in our employer-based plans (including an increase in the number of employees who opt out of employer-based plans) or our individual plans.
•because of unfavorable economic conditions or the aca, employers may stop offering health care coverage to employees or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs.
•our historical disability claim experience and industry data indicate that submitted disability claims rise under adverse economic conditions.
•if clients are not successful in generating sufficient funds or are precluded from securing financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us.
•our clients or potential clients may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their business.
•our clients may be acquired, consolidated, or otherwise fail to successfully maintain or grow their business or workforce, which could reduce the number of customers we serve or otherwise result in lower than anticipated utilization of our services.
•a prolonged unfavorable economic environment could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other health care providers, potentially increasing our medical costs as these providers attempt to maintain revenue levels in their efforts to adjust to their own economic challenges.
•our third-party vendors could significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output to reduce their operating costs. our business depends on our ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion.
these factors could lead to a decrease in our customer base, revenues or margins or an increase in our operating costs.
in addition, during and following a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, federal and state budgets could be materially adversely affected, resulting in reduced or delayed reimbursements or payments in federal and state government programs such as medicare and social security or under contracts with government entities. these federal and state budgetary pressures also could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments on us, such as premium taxes on insurance companies and hmos and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through, among other things, increases in premiums, there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
44
we are subject to the credit risk of our reinsurers.
we enter into reinsurance arrangements with other insurance companies, primarily to limit losses from large exposures or to permit recovery of a portion of direct losses. we also may enter into reinsurance arrangements in connection with acquisition or divestiture transactions when the underwriting company is not being acquired or sold.
under all reinsurance arrangements, reinsurers assume insured losses, subject to certain limitations or exceptions that may include a loss limit. these arrangements also subject us to various obligations, representations and warranties with the reinsurers. reinsurance does not relieve us of liability as the originating insurer. we remain liable to the underlying policyholders if a reinsurer defaults on obligations under the reinsurance arrangement. although we regularly evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers to minimize exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, reinsurers may become financially unsound. if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance contract or if the liabilities exceed any applicable loss limit, we will be forced to cover the claims on the reinsured policies.
the collectability of amounts due from reinsurers is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including whether the insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract, whether reinsurers or their affiliates have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of the reinsurance contract and the magnitude and type of collateral supporting our reinsurance recoverable, such as holding sufficient qualifying assets in trusts or letters of credit issued. although a portion of our reinsurance exposures are secured, the inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to provide information to assist you in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition as of december 31, 2019 compared with december 31, 2018 and our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared with 2018 and 2017. we encourage you to read this md&a in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k ("form 10-k") and the risk factors contained in part 1a of this form 10-k. for comparisons of our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2018 with 2017 please refer to the previously filed md&a included in part ii, item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018.
unless otherwise indicated, financial information in the md&a is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for additional information regarding the company's significant accounting policies. in some of our financial tables in this md&a, we present either percentage changes or "n/m" when those changes are so large as to become not meaningful. changes in percentages are expressed in basis points ("bps").
in this md&a, our consolidated measures "adjusted income from operations," earnings per share on that same basis, and "adjusted revenues" are not determined in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable gaap measures of "shareholders' net income," "earnings per share" and "total revenues." we also use pre-tax adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues to measure the results of our segments.
we use adjusted income from operations as our principal financial measure of operating performance because management believes it best reflects the underlying results of our business operations and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and profitability. we define adjusted income from operations as shareholders' net income (or income before taxes for the segment metric) excluding realized investment gains and losses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, results of anthem and coventry health care inc. ("coventry") (collectively, the "transitioning clients") (see the "key transactions and developments" section of the md&a for further discussion of transitioning clients) and special items. cigna's share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the international markets segment using the equity method of accounting are also excluded. income or expense amounts excluded from adjusted income from operations because they are not indicative of underlying performance or the responsibility of operating segment management include:
realized investment gains (losses) including changes in market values of certain financial instruments between balance sheet dates, as well as gains and losses associated with invested asset sales.
amortization of acquired intangible assets because these relate to costs incurred for acquisitions.
results of transitioning clients because those results are not indicative of ongoing results.
special items, if any, that management believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to the nature or size of these matters. see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for descriptions of special items.
the term "adjusted revenues" is defined as total revenues excluding the following adjustments: revenue contributions from transitioning clients, special items and cigna's share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the international markets segment using the equity method of accounting. we exclude these items from this measure because management believes they are not indicative of past or future underlying performance of the business.

commentary: 2019 versus 2018
unless indicated otherwise, the commentary presented below, and in the segment discussions that follow, compare results for the year ended december 31, 2019 with results for the year ended december 31, 2018.
earnings and revenue shareholders' net income increased, primarily driven by the earnings contribution from express scripts and improved results in the integrated medical segment partially offset by interest expense on debt issued to finance the express scripts acquisition. earnings per share also increased, but at a significantly lower rate, reflecting dilution from the shares issued in connection with the express scripts acquisition.
adjusted income from operations increased, primarily driven by earnings from express scripts' pharmacy benefits and health management businesses reported in the health services segment and improved results in integrated medical. these favorable results were partially offset by higher interest expense reported in corporate from both debt issued to finance the acquisition and debt assumed from express scripts. adjusted income from operations per share also increased, but at a significantly lower rate, reflecting dilution from the shares issued to acquire express scripts.
medical customers increased, primarily attributable to growth in the select and middle market segments, partially offset by a decline in the national accounts and individual market segments.
revenue growth primarily reflected the addition of express scripts and, to a lesser extent, business growth in the integrated medical segment. detailed revenue items are discussed further below.
opharmacy revenues in 2019 reflected the express scripts pharmacy benefit management business. in 2018, we reported pharmacy revenues from express scripts for the period following the acquisition on december 20, 2018. see the health services segment section of this md&a for further discussion of pharmacy revenues.
opremiums increased, primarily resulting from: 1) customer growth across all segments, predominantly integrated medical 2) rate increases in integrated medical reflecting underlying medical cost trends and 3) the addition of express scripts' medicare part d business.
ofees and other revenues increased primarily driven by contributions from express scripts' health management business reported in the health services segment. higher fees in our integrated medical segment primarily driven by growth in our specialty businesses also contributed to the increase.
onet investment income decreased, primarily reflecting the absence of investment income earned in the fourth quarter of 2018 on debt proceeds used to acquire express scripts in december 2018.
other components of consolidated results of operations
pharmacy and other service costs. in 2019, this amount was primarily comprised of the express scripts' pharmacy benefits and health management businesses reported in the health services segment. in 2018, we reported activity from express scripts for the period following the acquisition on december 20, 2018.
medical costs and other benefit expenses increased, primarily due to medical cost inflation in integrated medical, customer growth in the insured business and the addition of express scripts' medicare part d business.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased, primarily due to the addition of express scripts and, to a lesser extent, volume-related expenses in integrated medical. these increases were partially offset by suspension of the health insurance industry tax in 2019.
amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2019 primarily reflected the impact of the express scripts acquisition.
interest expense and other increased significantly, primarily due to interest incurred on debt issued in the third quarter of 2018 to finance the express scripts acquisition and interest incurred on express scripts' debt assumed upon closing of the acquisition.
realized investment gains (losses). we reported realized investment gains in 2019, compared with losses in 2018. the improvement primarily resulted from gains on sales of real estate joint ventures, higher gains on sales of debt securities and favorable market value adjustments on equity securities.
54
the consolidated effective tax rate declined, primarily due to suspension of the nondeductible health insurance industry tax in 2019 and recognition of incremental state tax benefits in the second quarter of 2019.
key transactions and business developments merger with express scripts as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, cigna acquired express scripts on december 20, 2018 in a cash and stock transaction valued at $52.8 billion. the "liquidity" section of this md&a provides further discussion of the impact of the acquisition on our liquidity and capital resources.
we continue to incur costs related to this transaction, including costs to integrate the cigna and express scripts operations. these costs are being reported in "integration and transaction-related costs" as a special item and excluded from adjusted income from operations because they are not indicative of future underlying performance of the business.
on january 30, 2019, anthem exercised its early termination right and terminated their pharmacy benefit management services agreement with us, effective march 1, 2019. there is a twelve-month transition period ending march 1, 2020. the transition of anthem's customers occurred at various dates, as informed by anthem's technology platform migration schedule. in 2019 and 2018, we excluded the results of express scripts' contract with anthem (and also coventry) from our non-gaap reporting metrics "adjusted revenues" and "adjusted income from operations" and referred to these clients as "transitioning clients." as of december 31, 2019, the transition of customers was substantially complete; therefore, beginning in 2020, we will no longer exclude results of transitioning clients from our reported adjusted revenues and adjusted income from operations.
agreement to sell group disability and life business as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, in december 2019, cigna entered into a definitive agreement to sell the group disability and life business to new york life insurance company for $6.3 billion. the "liquidity" section of this md&a provides further discussion of the impact of the pending divestiture on our liquidity and capital resources.
organizational efficiency plan as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company committed to a plan to increase our organizational alignment and operational efficiency and reduce costs. as a result we recognized a charge in selling, general and administrative expenses of $207 million, pre-tax ($162 million, after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019. we expect to realize annualized after-tax savings of approximately $180 million. a substantial portion of the savings is expected to be realized in 2020.

industry developments and other matters the "business - regulation" section of this form 10-k provides a detailed description of the patient protection and affordable care act ("aca") provisions and other legislative initiatives that impact our health care and pharmacy services businesses, including regulations issued by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ("cms") and the departments of the treasury and health and human services ("hhs"). the health care and pharmacy services businesses continue to operate in a dynamic environment, and the laws and regulations applicable to these businesses, including the aca, continue to be subject to legislative, regulatory and judicial challenges. the table presented below provides an update on the expected impact of these items and other matters as of december 31, 2019.

ma rates: final ma reimbursement rates for 2020 were published by cms in april 2019. preliminary ma reimbursement rates for 2021 were published by cms in february 2020. we do not expect the new rates to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations in 2020 and 2021. risk adjustment: as discussed in the "regulation" and "risk factors" sections of this form 10-k, our ma business is subject to reviews, including risk adjustment data validation ("radv") audits by cms and the office of the inspector general ("oig"). we expect that cms, oig and other federal agencies will continue to closely scrutinize components of the medicare program. the "regulation" section of this form 10-k also discusses a proposed rule issued by cms in 2018 for radv audits of contract year 2011 and all subsequent years that included, among other things, extrapolation of the error rate related to radv audit findings without applying the adjustment for underlying fee-for-service data errors as currently contemplated by cms's radv audit methodology. radv audits for our contract years 2011 through 2015 are currently in process. cms has announced its intent to use third-party auditors to audit all medicare advantage contracts by either a comprehensive or a targeted radv review for each contract year. if the proposed rule is adopted in its current form, it could result in some combination of degraded plan benefits, higher monthly premiums or reduced choice for the population served by all ma insurers. the company, along with other ma organizations and additional interested parties, submitted comments to cms on the proposed rule as part of the notice-and-comment rulemaking process. the comment period concluded on august 28, 2019. if cms adopts the rule as proposed, there could be a material impact on the company's future results of operations, though we expect the rule would be subject to legal challenges. in addition, the company is subject to oig radv audits that are in process. the u.s. department of justice also is currently conducting an industry-wide investigation of risk adjustment data submission practices and business processes, as described in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.

aca cost-sharing reduction subsidies: the aca provides for cost-sharing reductions that offset the amount that qualifying customers pay for deductibles, copays and coinsurance. the federal government stopped funding insurers for the cost-sharing reduction subsidies in 2017. certain insurers have sued the federal government for failure to pay cost-sharing reduction subsidies and the matter remains unresolved. to date, judges in six of those actions have ruled in favor of the insurers, five of which are presently under appeal. the court of appeals for the federal circuit heard oral argument in the first set of consolidated appeals on january 9, 2020. we will continue to monitor developments. our premium rates for the 2019 and 2020 plan years reflected a lack of government funding for cost-sharing reduction subsidies.

risk mitigation programs - individual aca business in 2016, we recorded an allowance for the entire balance of our aca risk corridor receivable based on court decisions and the large program deficit. during 2018, the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit ruled that health insurers are not entitled to receive amounts due under the risk corridor program that have been withheld by congress. the plaintiffs petitioned the u.s. supreme court to review this unfavorable decision. during the second quarter of 2019, the u.s. supreme court agreed to review the unfavorable lower court rulings in the risk corridor cases, and heard oral arguments on december 10, 2019. we now await a decision, which is expected by june 2020. we continue to carry an allowance for the balance of our aca risk corridor receivables of $109 million. no other significant updates occurred in 2019 related to the risk corridor legal matters.
risk adjustment balances are subject to audit adjustment by cms following each program year. in april 2019, cms published the final notice of benefit and payment parameters for the 2020 plan year that clarified the 2017 benefit year radv program. cms released the 2017 benefit year data validation error rates in may and published the preliminary radv transfers in august 2019. based on the information currently available, we adjusted our risk adjustment balance to reflect the expected outcome of the radv program.
the following table presents our balances associated with the risk adjustment program as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, inclusive of the radv adjustments recorded in 2019.

liquidity we maintain liquidity at two levels: the subsidiary level and the parent company level.
liquidity requirements at the subsidiary level generally consist of:
·medical costs, pharmacy and other benefit payments;
·expense requirements, primarily for employee compensation and benefits, information technology and facilities costs;
income taxes; and
debt service.
58
our subsidiaries normally meet their liquidity requirements by:
·maintaining appropriate levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments;
·using cash flows from operating activities;
matching investment durations to those estimated for the related insurance and contractholder liabilities;
selling investments; and
borrowing from affiliates, subject to applicable regulatory limits.
liquidity requirements at the parent company level generally consist of:
·debt service and dividend payments to shareholders;
·lending to subsidiaries as needed; and
pension plan funding.
the parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements by:
·maintaining appropriate levels of cash and various types of marketable investments;
·collecting dividends from its subsidiaries;
·using proceeds from issuance of debt and common stock; and
borrowing from its subsidiaries, subject to applicable regulatory limits.
dividends from our insurance, health maintenance organization ("hmo") and foreign subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these restrictions. most of express scripts' subsidiaries provide significant financial flexibility to cigna because they are not subject to regulatory restrictions on paying dividends.

the following discussion explains variances in the various categories of cash flows in 2019 compared with 2018.
operating activities cash flows from operating activities consist principally of cash receipts and disbursements for pharmacy revenues and costs, premiums, fees, investment income, taxes, benefit costs and other expenses.
cash flows from operating activities increased, primarily driven by higher net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization and the settlement timing of payables and accrued liabilities. these increases were partially offset by the timing of accounts receivable collections.
59
investing and financing activities our most significant investing and financing activities in 2018 related to acquiring express scripts. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the acquisition. cigna financed a portion of the acquisition in cash, primarily with debt financing as shown above and described more fully in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, with the remaining required cash coming from cash on hand. in 2018, cigna also acquired onepath life for approximately $480 million, largely with cash held in our foreign operations.
cash used for investing activities decreased, primarily due to the absence of cash paid to acquire express scripts in 2018 and lower net investment purchases, partially offset by higher property and equipment purchases.
cash used for financing activities increased, primarily due to the absence of the express scripts acquisition debt financing activities in 2018, higher repayments of long-term debt and share repurchases.
we maintain a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors. under this program, we may repurchase shares from time to time, depending on market conditions and alternate uses of capital. the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, general business and market conditions and alternate uses of capital. the share repurchase program may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with rule 10b-18 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, including through rule 10b5-1 trading plans. the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
in 2019, we repurchased 11.8 million shares for approximately $2.0 billion. from january 1, 2020 through february 26, 2020 we repurchased 2.0 million shares for approximately $425 million. share repurchase authority was $3.5 billion as of february 26, 2020.
capital resources our capital resources (primarily cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities) provide protection for policyholders, furnish the financial strength to underwrite insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth.
our acquisition of express scripts increased our debt and shareholders' equity in 2018 as follows:
stock. express scripts' shareholders received 0.2434 of a share of common stock of cigna for every one share of express scripts' common stock. cigna issued 137.6 million additional shares to express scripts' shareholders.
debt. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the debt issued to finance the acquisition.
assumption of express scripts' senior notes. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the notes assumed in the acquisition of express scripts.
at december 31, 2019, our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 45.2%, a decline from 50.9% at december 31, 2018. we have a near-term focus on accelerated debt repayment and expect to continue to deleverage into the upper 30%s by the end of 2020 using cash flows from operating activities.
in december 2019, cigna entered into a definitive agreement to sell the group disability and life business to new york life insurance company for $6.3 billion. the sale is expected to close by the third quarter of 2020 subject to applicable regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. cigna estimates to receive approximately $5.3 billion of net after-tax proceeds from this transaction and expects to use these proceeds for share repurchase and repayment of debt in 2020.
in 2018, cigna entered into a new revolving credit agreement and term loan credit agreement in financing the express scripts acquisition. cigna had $10 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit agreement as of december 31, 2019. in 2019, cigna entered into an additional 364-day revolving credit agreement that matures in october 2020. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our revolving credit agreements.
management, guided by regulatory requirements and rating agency capital guidelines, determines the amount of capital resources that we maintain. management allocates resources to new long-term business commitments when returns, considering the risks, look promising and when the resources available to support existing business are adequate.
60
we prioritize our use of capital resources to:
provide the capital necessary to support growth and maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of subsidiaries and to fund pension obligations;
consider acquisitions that are strategically and economically advantageous; and
return capital to investors primarily through share repurchases.
our capital management strategy to support the liquidity and regulatory capital requirements of our foreign operations and certain international growth initiatives is to retain overseas a significant portion of the earnings generated by our foreign operations. this strategy does not materially limit our ability to meet our liquidity and capital needs in the united states.
liquidity and capital resources outlook we maintain sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs through our cash and cash equivalents balances, cash flows from operations, commercial paper program, credit agreements, and the issuance of long-term debt. as of december 31, 2019, we had approximately $5 billion in cash and short-term investments, approximately $1.1 billion of which was held by the parent company or nonregulated subsidiaries. we actively monitor our debt obligations and engage in issuance or redemption activities as needed in accordance with our capital management strategy. a description of our outstanding debt can be found in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
as of december 31, 2019, our unfunded pension liability was $873 million, reflecting an increase of $ 283 million from december 31, 2018, primarily attributable to a decrease in discount rates of approximately 90 basis points and an update to mortality assumptions. we currently expect 2020 and 2021 required contributions to be immaterial. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension plans.
our cash projections may not be realized and the demand for funds could exceed available cash if our ongoing businesses experience unexpected shortfalls in earnings or we experience material adverse effects from one or more risks or uncertainties described more fully in the risk factors section in this form 10-k. though we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity, significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets could increase costs or affect our ability to access those markets for additional borrowings. in addition to the sources of liquidity discussed above, the parent company can borrow an additional $1.0 billion from its insurance subsidiaries without further state approval.
guarantees and contractual obligations we are contingently liable for various contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business. see the "liquidity and capital resources" section of this md&a for additional background on how we manage our liquidity requirements related to these obligations. the maturities of our primary contractual cash obligations are as follows as of december 31, 2019:

on balance sheet:
insurance liabilities. excluded from the table above are $4 billion of insurance liabilities ($3 billion in contractholder deposit funds; $1 billion in future policy benefits) associated with the sold retirement benefits and individual life insurance and annuity businesses, as well as the reinsured workers' compensation, personal accident and supplemental benefits businesses as their related net cash flows are not expected to impact our cash flows. excluding these amounts, the sum of the obligations presented above exceeds the corresponding insurance and contractholder liabilities of $23 billion recorded on the balance sheet (including $6 billion reported in liabilities held for sale) because some of the recorded insurance liabilities reflect discounting for interest and the recorded contractholder liabilities exclude future interest crediting, charges and fees. the timing and amount of actual future cash flows may differ from those presented above.
ocontractholder deposit funds: see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policy for this liability. expected future cash flows presented above also include estimated future interest crediting on current fund balances based on current investment yields less the estimated cost of insurance charges and mortality and administrative fees for universal life policies.
ofuture policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses: see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies for these liabilities. expected future cash flows for these liabilities presented in the table above are undiscounted. the expected future cash flows for guaranteed minimum death benefit ("gmdb," reported in future policy benefits) do not consider any of the related reinsurance arrangements.
long-term debt includes scheduled interest payments and current maturities of long-term debt. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding long-term debt. finance leases are included in long-term debt and primarily represent obligations for information technology network storage, servers and equipment. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding finance leases.
operating leases: see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other noncurrent liabilities include estimated payments for guaranteed minimum income benefit ("gmib") contracts (without considering any related reinsurance arrangements), pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations, supplemental and deferred compensation plans, interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts and reinsurance liabilities. estimated payments of $91 million for deferred compensation, non-qualified and international pension plans and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans are expected to be paid in less than one year and are included in the table above. we expect to make immaterial contributions to the qualified domestic pension plans during 2020 and they are reflected in the above table. we expect to make payments subsequent to 2020 for these obligations; however, subsequent payments have been excluded from the table as their timing is based on plan assumptions that may materially differ from actual activities. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension obligations.
the table above excludes the liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such future payments. in the event we are unable to sustain all of our $1 billion of uncertain tax positions it could result in future tax payments of approximately $760 million. see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on uncertain tax positions.

our estimated future service commitments primarily represent contracts for certain outsourced business processes and information technology maintenance and support. we generally have the ability to terminate these agreements, but do not anticipate doing so at this time. purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancelable without penalty and those that do not contractually require minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased.
guarantees we are contingently liable for various financial and other guarantees provided in the ordinary course of business. see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on guarantees.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:
it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and
changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
management has discussed how critical accounting estimates are developed and selected with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below. we regularly evaluate items that may impact critical accounting estimates.
in addition to the estimates presented in the following tables, there are other accounting estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements, including estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits, as well as estimates with respect to pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions and certain compensation accruals.
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. however, if actual experience significantly differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition. the tables below present the adverse impacts of certain possible changes in assumptions. the effect of assumption changes in the opposite direction would be a positive impact to our consolidated results of operations, liquidity or financial condition, except for assessing impairment of goodwill and debt securities carried at fair value below cost.

goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of their net assets at the acquisition date. intangible assets primarily reflect the value of customer relationships and other intangibles acquired in business combinations. fair values of reporting units are estimated using models and assumptions that we believe a hypothetical market participant would use to determine a current transaction price. the significant assumptions and estimates used in determining fair value include the discount rate and future cash flows. a discount rate is selected to correspond with each reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, consistent with that used for investment decisions considering the specific and detailed operating plans and strategies within each reporting unit. projections of future cash flows for each reporting unit are consistent with our annual planning process for revenues, pharmacy costs, benefits expenses, operating expenses, taxes, capital levels and long-term growth rates. in addition to these assumptions, we consider market data to evaluate the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of intangibles and the amortization method were determined using an income approach that relies on projected future cash flows including key assumptions for customer attrition and discount rates. management revises amortization periods if it believes there has been a change in the length of time that an intangible asset will continue to have value. we completed our normal annual evaluations for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the third quarter of 2019. the evaluations indicated that the fair value estimates of our reporting units exceed their carrying values by sufficient margins and no impairments were required. goodwill and other intangibles as of december 31 were as follows (in millions): 2019 - goodwill $44,602; other intangible assets $36,5622018 - goodwill $44,505; other intangible assets $39,003 see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our goodwill and other intangible assets.   if we do not achieve our earnings and cash flow projections or our cost of capital rises significantly, the assumptions and estimates underlying the goodwill and intangible asset impairment evaluations could be adversely affected and result in future impairment charges that would negatively impact our operating results and financial position. specific to the government reporting unit, future changes in the funding for our medicare programs by the federal government could materially reduce revenues and profitability and have a significant impact on its fair value.

income taxes - uncertain tax positions we evaluate tax positions to determine whether the benefits are more likely than not to be sustained on audit based on their technical merits. if not, we establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. these amounts primarily relate to federal and state uncertain positions of the value and timing of deductions and uncertain positions of attributing taxable income to states. balances that are included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows: 2019 - $1.0 billion2018 - $928 million see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion around uncertain tax positions and the liquidity and capital resources section of this md&amp;a for a discussion of their potential impact on liquidity.   the factors that could impact our estimates of uncertain tax positions include the likelihood of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position and related assumed interest and penalties. if our positions are upheld upon audit, our net income would increase.

unpaid claims and claim expenses - integrated medical unpaid claims and claim expenses include both reported claims and estimates for losses incurred but not yet reported. unpaid claims and claim expenses in integrated medical are primarily impacted by assumptions related to completion factors and medical cost trend. variation of actual results from either assumption could impact the unpaid claims balance as noted below. a large number of factors may cause the medical cost trend to vary from the company's estimates, including: changes in health management practices, changes in the level and mix of benefits offered and services utilized, and changes in medical practices. completion factors may be affected if actual claims submission rates from providers differ from estimates (that can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions), or if changes to the company's internal claims processing patterns occur. unpaid claims and claim expenses for the integrated medical segment as of december 31 were as follows (in millions): 2019 - gross $2,892; net $2,5892018 - gross $2,697; net $2,433 these liabilities are presented above both gross and net of reinsurance and other recoverables. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding assumptions and methods used to estimate this liability.   based on studies of our claim experience, it is reasonably possible that a 100 basis point change in the medical cost trend and a 50 basis point change in completion factors could occur in the near term. a 100 basis point increase in the medical cost trend rate would increase this liability by approximately $40 million, resulting in a decrease in net income of approximately $35 million after-tax, and a 50 basis point decrease in completion factors would increase this liability by approximately $85 million, resulting in a decrease in net income of approximately $70 million after-tax.

unpaid claims and claim expenses - long-term disability reserves the liability for long-term disability reserves is the present value of estimated future benefits payments over the expected disability period and includes estimates for both reported claims and for claims incurred but not yet reported. key assumptions in the calculation of long-term disability reserves include the discount rate and claim resolution rates, both of which are reviewed annually and updated when experience or future expectations would indicate a necessary change. the discount rate is the interest rate used to discount the projected future benefit payments to their present value. the discount rate assumption is based on the projected investment yield of the assets supporting the reserves. claim resolution rate assumptions involve many factors including claimant demographics, the type of contractual benefit provided and the time since initially becoming disabled. the company uses its own historical experience to develop its claim resolution rates. long-term disability reserves as of december 31 were as follows (in millions): 2019 - gross $4,308; net $4,1912018 - gross $4,069; net $3,975 these liabilities are presented above both gross and net of reinsurance recoverables and are included in liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet. see note 9c. to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding assumptions and methods used to estimate this liability.   based on recent and historical resolution rate patterns and changes in investment portfolio yields, it is reasonably possible that a five percent change in claim resolution rates and a 25 basis point change in the discount rate could occur. a five percent decrease in the claim resolution rate would increase long-term disability reserves by approximately $95 million and decrease net income by approximately $75 million after-tax. a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase long-term disability reserves by approximately $45 million and decrease net income by approximately $35 million after-tax.

segment reporting the following section of this md&a discusses the results of each of our segments. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our segments.
in segment discussions, we present adjusted revenues and "pre-tax adjusted income from operations," defined as income before taxes excluding realized investment gains (losses), amortization of acquired intangible assets, results of transitioning clients, (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and special items. ratios presented in this segment discussion exclude the same items as pre-tax adjusted income from operations. see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these metrics and a reconciliation of income before income taxes to pre-tax adjusted income from operations, as well as a reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues. note 23 to the consolidated financial statements also explains two additional items that are important in understanding our segment results: 1) segment revenues include both external revenues and sales between segments that are eliminated in corporate and 2) beginning in the first quarter of 2019, compensation cost for stock options is recorded by the segments. prior year segment information was not restated for this change in stock option reporting.
in these segment discussions, we also present "pre-tax adjusted margin," defined as pre-tax adjusted income from operations divided by adjusted revenues.
see the md&a executive overview for summarized financial results of each of our segments.
health services segment the health services segment includes pharmacy benefits management, specialty pharmacy services, clinical solutions, home delivery and health management services. this segment includes express scripts' business from the december 20, 2018 date of acquisition except for express scripts' medicare part d business that is reported in the government operating segment of our integrated medical segment. this segment also includes cigna's legacy home delivery pharmacy business. due to the timing of the acquisition, results of operations in 2018 only included results from the express scripts' business for the period following the acquisition on december 20, 2018. the main driver of period over period increases in the financial information presented below was the results from the express scripts' business in 2019. as described in the introduction to segment reporting, performance of the health services segment is measured using pre-tax adjusted income from operations.
the key factors that impact health services revenues and costs of revenues are volume, mix and price. these key factors are discussed further below. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on revenue and cost recognition policies for this segment.
as our clients' claim volumes increase or decrease, our resulting revenues and cost of revenues correspondingly increase or decrease. our gross profit could also increase or decrease as a result of changes in purchasing discounts.
the mix of claims generally considers the type of drug and distribution method used for dispensing and fulfilling. as our mix of drugs changes, our resulting pharmacy revenues and cost of revenues correspondingly may increase or decrease. the primary driver of fluctuations within our mix of claims is the generic fill rate. generally, higher generic fill rates reduce revenues, as generic drugs are typically priced lower than the branded drugs they replace. however, as ingredient cost paid to pharmacies on generic drugs is incrementally lower than the price charged to our clients, higher generic fill rates generally have a favorable impact on our gross profit. the home delivery generic fill rate is currently lower than the network generic fill rate as fewer generic substitutions are available among maintenance medications (such as therapies for chronic conditions) commonly dispensed from home delivery pharmacies as compared to acute medications that are primarily dispensed by pharmacies in our retail networks.
our client contract pricing is impacted by our ability to negotiate supply chain contracts for pharmacy network, pharmaceutical and wholesaler purchasing and manufacturer rebates. as we seek to improve the effectiveness of our integrated solutions for the benefit of our clients, we are continuously innovating and optimizing the supply chain. our gross profit could also increase or decrease as a result of supply chain initiatives implemented. inflation also impacts our pricing because most of our contracts provide that we bill clients and pay pharmacies based on a generally recognized price index for pharmaceuticals. therefore, the rate of inflation for prescription drugs and our efforts to manage this inflation for our clients can affect our revenues and cost of revenues.
in this md&a, we present revenues and gross profit "excluding transitioning clients" in addition to those metrics including transitioning clients. pre-tax adjusted income from operations and pre-tax adjusted margin exclude contributions from transitioning

clients. see the "key transactions and business developments" section of this md&a for further discussion of transitioning clients and why we present this information.

our debt securities portfolio increased during 2019 reflecting increased valuations due to decreases in market yields, partially offset by net sales and maturities. as of december 31, 2019, $21.2 billion, or 90% of the debt securities in our investment portfolio were investment grade (baa and above, or equivalent) and the remaining $2.5 billion were below investment grade. the majority of the bonds that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the non-investment grade spectrum. these quality characteristics have not materially changed from the prior year and are consistent with our investment strategy. investments in debt securities are diversified by issuer, geography and industry as appropriate.
foreign government obligations are concentrated in asia, primarily south korea, consistent with our risk management practice and local regulatory requirements of our international business operations. corporate debt securities include private placement assets of $7.5 billion. these investments are generally less marketable than publicly-traded bonds; however yields on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publicly-traded bonds with comparable credit risk. we perform a credit analysis of each issuer and require financial and other covenants that allow us to monitor issuers for deteriorating financial strength and pursue remedial actions, if warranted.
in addition to amounts classified as debt securities in our consolidated balance sheets, we participate in an insurance joint venture in china with a 50% ownership interest. this entity had an investment portfolio of approximately $8.1 billion supporting its business that is primarily invested in chinese corporate and government debt securities. we account for this joint venture on the equity method of accounting and report it in other assets. there were no investments with a material unrealized loss as of december 31, 2019.
commercial mortgage loans our commercial mortgage loans are fixed rate loans, diversified by property type, location and borrower. loans are secured by high quality commercial properties and are generally made at less than 70% of the property's value at origination of the loan. property value, debt service coverage, quality, building tenancy and stability of cash flows are all important financial underwriting considerations. we hold no direct residential mortgage loans and do not originate or service securitized mortgage loans.
commercial real estate capital markets remain very active for well-leased, quality commercial real estate located in strong institutional investment markets. the vast majority of properties securing the mortgages in our mortgage loan portfolio possess these characteristics.
as of december 31, 2019, the $1.9 billion commercial mortgage loan portfolio consisted of approximately 65 loans that are in good standing. given the quality and diversity of the underlying real estate, positive debt service coverage and significant borrower cash investment generally ranging between 30 and 40%, we remain confident that borrowers will continue to perform as expected under their contract terms.
other long-term investments other long-term investments of $ 2.4 billion as of december 31, 2019 included investments in securities limited partnerships and real estate limited partnerships as well as direct investments in real estate joint ventures. these entities typically invest in mezzanine debt or equity of privately-held companies (securities partnerships) and equity real estate. given our subordinate position in the capital structure of these underlying entities, we assume a higher level of risk for higher expected returns. to mitigate risk, these investments are diversified across approximately 160 separate partnerships and approximately 80 general partners who manage one or more of these partnerships. also, the underlying investments are diversified by industry sector or property type and geographic region. no single partnership investment exceeded 5% of our securities and real estate partnership portfolio.
73
problem and potential problem investments
"problem" bonds and commercial mortgage loans are either delinquent by 60 days or more or have been restructured as to terms, including concessions by us for modification of interest rate, principal payment or maturity date. "potential problem" bonds and commercial mortgage loans are considered current (no payment is more than 59 days past due), but management believes they have certain characteristics that increase the likelihood that they may become problems.
the amount of problem or potential problem investments as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 was not material.
investment outlook public equity markets rallied during 2019, reflecting the continued strength of the u.s. economy. however, concerns related to trade and tariffs continue to contribute to financial market volatility. we continue to closely monitor global macroeconomic conditions and trends, including uncertainty caused by the united kingdom's process of exiting the european union, and their potential impact on our investment portfolio. we expect continued volatility in certain sectors, such as retail, energy and natural gas. future realized and unrealized investment results will be driven largely by market conditions that exist when a transaction occurs or at the reporting date. these future conditions are not reasonably predictable; however, we believe that the vast majority of our investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms. based on our strategy to match the duration of invested assets to the duration of insurance and contractholder liabilities, we expect to hold a significant portion of these assets for the long term. although future impairment losses resulting from interest rate movements and credit deterioration due to both investment-specific and the global economic uncertainties discussed above remain possible, we do not expect these losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.
market risk financial instruments our assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices. consistent with disclosure requirements, the following items have been excluded from this consideration of market risk for financial instruments:
changes in the fair values of insurance-related assets and liabilities because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk;
changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans (and related assets); and
changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities such as goodwill, deferred policy acquisition costs, taxes, and various accrued liabilities. because they are not financial instruments, their primary risks are other than market risk.
excluding these items, our primary market risk exposures from financial instruments are:
interest-rate risk on fixed-rate, medium-term instruments. changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a fixed return.
foreign currency exchange rate risk of the u.s. dollar primarily to the south korean won, chinese yuan renminbi, new zealand dollar, and taiwan dollar. an unfavorable change in exchange rates reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies.
our management of market risks we predominantly rely on three techniques to manage our exposure to market risk:
investment/liability matching. we generally select investment assets with characteristics (such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity) that correspond to the underlying characteristics of our related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that we can match the investments to our obligations. shorter-term investments generally support shorter-term life and health liabilities. medium-term, fixed-rate investments support interest-sensitive and health liabilities. longer-term investments generally support products with longer pay out periods such as annuities and long-term disability liabilities.
use of local currencies for foreign operations. we generally conduct our international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies. this technique limits exchange rate risk to our net assets.
use of derivatives. we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our primary market risks. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about derivative financial instruments.

effect of market fluctuations assuming a 100 basis point increase in interest rates and 10% strengthening in the u.s. dollar to foreign currencies, the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial instruments, subject to the exclusions noted above (particularly insurance liabilities), would have been as follows as of december 31:

100 basis point increase in interest rates (excluding long-term debt)       $ 1.6       $ 1.6
10% strengthening in u.s. dollar to foreign currencies                      $ 0.3       $ 0.4
the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates, primarily on debt securities and commercial mortgage loans, was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models, primarily duration modeling.
in the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the fair value of the company's long-term debt would decrease approximately $2.5 billion at december 31, 2019 and $2.4 billion at december 31, 2018. changes in the fair value of our long-term debt do not impact our financial position or operating results. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the company's debt.
the effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to the foreign currencies of certain financial instruments held by us was estimated to be 10% of the u.s. dollar equivalent fair value. our foreign operations hold investment assets, such as debt securities, cash, and cash equivalents that are generally invested in the currency of the related liabilities.

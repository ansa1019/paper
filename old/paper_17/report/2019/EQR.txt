item 1a. risk factors general this item 1a includes forward-looking statements.  you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements included in item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect, possibly in a material manner, our business, financial condition or results of operations, which could affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest (which we refer to collectively as "shares"), preference units, op units, restricted units and our public unsecured debt.  in this section, we refer to the shares, preference units, op units, restricted units and public unsecured debt together as our "securities" and the investors who own such securities as our "security holders."
risks related to our business strategy investing in real estate is inherently subject to risks that could negatively impact our business.
investing in real estate is subject to varying degrees and types of risk. while we seek to mitigate these risks through various strategies, including geographic diversification, market research and proactive asset management, among other techniques, these risks cannot be eliminated. factors that may impact cash flows and real estate values include, but are not limited to:
•   local economic conditions, particularly oversupply or reductions in demand;

•   national, regional and local political climates and governmental policies;

•   the inability or unwillingness of residents to pay rent increases;

•   increases in our operating expenses;

•   cost of labor and materials required to maintain our properties at acceptable standards;

•   availability of attractive financing opportunities;

•   changes in social preferences; and

•   additional risks that are discussed below.

competition in multifamily housing may negatively affect operations and demand for the company's properties or residents.
our properties face competition for residents from other existing or new multifamily properties, condominiums, single family homes and other living arrangements, whether owned or rental, that may attract residents from our properties or prospective residents that would otherwise choose to live with us.  as a result, we may not be able to renew existing resident leases or enter into new resident leases, or if we are able to renew or enter into new leases, they may be at rates or terms that are less favorable than our current rates or terms, resulting in a material impact on our results of operations.
failure to generate sufficient revenue could limit our ability to make financing payments or distributions to security holders.
a decrease in cash flows due to declines in rental revenue could negatively affect our ability to make financing payments and distributions to our security holders. significant expenditures associated with each property, such as real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance costs and employee wages and benefits, may also negatively impact cash flows and not decline as quickly or at the same rate as revenues when circumstances might cause a reduction at our properties.
the short-term nature of apartment leases expose us more quickly to the effects of declining market rents, potentially making our revenue more volatile.
generally our residential apartment leases are for twelve months or less.  if the terms of the renewal or reletting are less favorable than current terms, then the company's results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected. given our generally shorter term lease structure, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms.
9
the geographic concentration of our properties could have an adverse effect on our operations.
the company's properties are highly concentrated in our primarily coastal markets.  if one or more of our markets is unfavorably impacted by specific economic conditions, local real estate conditions, increases in real estate and other taxes, rent control or stabilization laws or localized environmental issues or natural/man-made disasters, the impact of such conditions may have a more negative impact on our results of operations than if our properties were more geographically diverse.
additionally within its primarily coastal markets, the company is highly concentrated in certain dense urban and suburban submarkets.  to the extent that these particular submarkets become less desirable to operate in, including changes in multifamily housing supply and demand, our results of operations could be more negatively impacted than if we were more diversified within our markets.
operations from new acquisitions, development projects and renovations may fail to perform as expected.
we intend to actively acquire, develop and renovate multifamily operating properties as part of our business strategy.  newly acquired, developed or renovated properties may not perform as we expect.  we may also overestimate the revenue (or underestimate the expenses) that a new or repositioned project may generate.  the occupancy rates and rents at these properties may fail to meet the expectations underlying our investment.  development and renovations, in particular, are subject to greater uncertainties and risks due to complexities and lead time in estimating costs.  we may underestimate the costs necessary to operate an acquired property to the standards established for its intended market position.  we may also underestimate the costs to complete a development property or to complete a renovation.
competition for acquisitions may prevent us from acquiring properties on favorable terms.
we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition and development opportunities.  we expect that other real estate investors will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts.  we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms.
because real estate investments are illiquid, we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate.
real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly.  we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions.  we may be unable to consummate such dispositions in a timely manner, on attractive terms, or at all.  in some cases, we may also determine that we will not recover the carrying amount of the property upon disposition.  this inability to reallocate our capital promptly could negatively affect our financial condition, including our ability to make distributions to our security holders.
the company's real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges.
a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap") if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of the amortized cost of such assets. if such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write-down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired. such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. if we are required to recognize material asset impairment charges in the future, these charges could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
construction risks on our development projects could affect our profitability.
we intend to continue to develop multifamily properties as part of our business strategy.  development often includes long planning and entitlement timelines, subjecting the project to changes in market conditions. it can involve complex and costly activities, including significant environmental remediation or construction work in our markets.  we may also experience an increase in costs due to general disruptions that affect the cost of labor and/or materials such as trade disputes, tariffs, labor unrest and/or geopolitical conflicts.  we may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons, and as a result, we may fail to recover expenses or option payments already incurred in exploring those opportunities.  we may also be unable to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, occupancy, or other required governmental or third party permits and
10
authorizations.  these and other risks inherent in development projects could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities.
we are subject to risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures.
we currently and may continue to in the future develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities.  joint ventures create risks including the following:
•   the possibility that our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and therefore we may be forced to make contributions to protect our investments;

•   we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses;

•   our partners might at any time have business or economic goals that are inconsistent with ours; and

•   our partners may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our recommendations, instructions or requests.

at times we have entered into agreements providing for joint and several liability with our partners.  we also have in the past and could choose in the future to guarantee part of or all of certain joint venture debt.  we and our respective joint venture partners may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement that could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partner's interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction.  in some instances, joint venture partners may also have competing interests or objectives that could create conflicts of interest similar to those noted above. these objectives may be contrary to our compliance with the reit requirements, and our reit status could be jeopardized if any of our joint ventures do not operate in compliance with those requirements. to the extent our partners do not meet their obligations to us or our joint ventures, or they take actions inconsistent with the interests of the joint venture, it could have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition, including distributions to our security holders.
risks related to our financing strategy and capital structure disruptions in the financial markets could hinder our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions.
dislocations and disruptions in capital markets could result in increased costs or lack of availability of debt financing (including under our $1.0 billion commercial paper program) and equity financing. such events may affect our ability to refinance existing debt, require us to utilize higher cost alternatives and/or impair our ability to adjust to changing economic and business conditions.  capital market disruptions could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions or make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may unfavorably affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell.  such disruptions could cause the price of our securities to decline.
our financial counterparties may not perform their obligations.
although we have not experienced any material counterparty non-performance, disruptions in financial and credit markets or other events could impair the ability of our counterparties to perform under their contractual obligations to us.  there are multiple financial institutions that are individually committed to provide borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  should any of these institutions fail to perform their obligations when contractually required, our financial condition could be adversely affected.
rising interest rates can increase costs.
the company is exposed to market risk from financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates.  such risks derive from the refinancing of debt, exposure to interest rate fluctuations in floating rate debt and from derivative instruments utilized to swap fixed rate debt to floating rates or to hedge rates in anticipation of future debt issuances.  increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense and the costs of refinancing existing debt.
insufficient cash flow could affect our ability to service existing debt and create refinancing risk.
we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments.  we may not be able to refinance existing debt and if we can, the terms of such refinancing may be less favorable than the terms of existing indebtedness.  our inability to refinance, extend or repay debt with proceeds from other capital market transactions would negatively impact our financial condition.  if the debt is secured, the mortgage holder may also foreclose on the property.
11
a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance.
a significant downgrade in our credit ratings, while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the company's revolving credit facility, would cause the corresponding borrowing costs to increase, impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt, and potentially impair our ability to access the commercial paper market or otherwise limit our access to capital.  in addition, a downgrade below investment grade would require us to post cash collateral and/or letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our self-insured property and liability insurance deductibles or to obtain lower deductible insurance compliant with the lenders' requirements at the lower ratings level.
financial covenants could limit operational flexibility and affect our overall financial position.
the terms of our credit agreements, including our revolving credit facility and the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued, require us to comply with a number of financial covenants. these covenants may limit our flexibility to run our business and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness and trigger a cross default of other debt.
some of our properties are financed with tax-exempt bonds or otherwise contain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions, including affordability requirements, which limit income from certain properties.  the company monitors compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties.  while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit from financing properties with tax-exempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions, this may not always be the case.  some of these requirements are complex, and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities.
we may change the dividend policy for our securities in the future.
the decision to declare and pay dividends on our securities, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, is at the discretion of the board of trustees and will depend on actual and projected financial conditions, the company's actual and projected liquidity and operating results, the company's projected cash needs for capital expenditures and other investment activities and such other factors as the company's board of trustees deems relevant.  the board of trustees may modify our dividend policy from time to time and any change in our dividend policy could negatively impact the market price of our securities.
changes in market conditions and volatility of share prices could decrease the market price of our common shares.
the stock markets, including the new york stock exchange on which we list our common shares, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations over time.  as a result, the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile.  investors in our common shares consequently may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases due to this volatility and not necessarily related to our operating performance or prospects.  additionally, the market price of our common shares may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to the sale of substantial amounts of our common shares, or the anticipation of the sale of such shares, by large holders of our securities.  the issuance of additional common shares by the company, or the perception that such issuances might occur, could also cause significant volatility and decreases in the value of our shares.
issuances or sales of our common shares or units may be dilutive.
any potential additional issuance of common shares or op units would reduce the percentage of our common shares and op units owned by investors. in most circumstances, shareholders and unitholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common shares or units. in addition, depending on the terms and pricing of additional offerings of our common shares or units along with the value of our properties, our shareholders and unitholders could experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common shares or units, as well as dilution in our actual and expected earnings per share, funds from operations ("ffo") per share and normalized ffo per share.
general risks we depend on our key personnel.
we depend on the efforts of our trustees and executive officers.  if one or more of them resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us, our business and results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
12
the occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our reputation and business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.
a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt payment collections and operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information, including information regarding our residents, prospective residents, employees and employees' dependents.
despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures, required employee awareness training and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems and systems maintained by third party vendors with which we do business are vulnerable to damage from any number of sources.  we face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to emails, phishing attempts or other scams, persons inside our organization or persons/vendors with access to our systems and other significant disruptions of our information technology networks and related systems, including property infrastructure.  our information technology networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations.  even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.  accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.
we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing activities, and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our employees and their dependents.  in addition, we engage third party service providers that may have access to such personally identifiable information in connection with providing necessary information technology, security and other business services to us.  the systems of our third party service providers may contain defects in design or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise personally identifiable information.  although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology networks and those of our third party providers and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.
we address potential breaches or disclosure of this confidential personally identifiable information by implementing a variety of security measures intended to protect the confidentiality and security of this information including (among others):  (a) engaging reputable, recognized firms to help us design and maintain our information technology and data security systems; (b) conducting periodic testing and verification of information and data security systems, including performing ethical hacks of our systems to discover where any vulnerabilities may exist; and (c) providing periodic employee awareness training around phishing and other scams, malware and other cyber risks.  the company also has a cyber liability insurance policy to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of data and network breaches and data privacy regulations which provides a policy aggregate limit and a per occurrence deductible.  cyber liability insurance generally covers, among other things, costs associated with the wrongful release, through inadvertent breach or network attack, of personally identifiable information.  however, there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent a cyber incident or that our cyber liability insurance coverage will be sufficient in the event of a cyber incident.
a breach or significant and extended disruption in the function of our systems, including our primary website, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose residents and revenues, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, generate third party claims, result in the unintended and/or unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary, personally identifiable and confidential information and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues.  we may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers, our insurers or any other responsible parties.  as a result, there can be no assurance that our financial results would not be negatively impacted.
litigation risk could affect our business.
we may become involved in legal proceedings, claims, actions, inquiries and investigations in the ordinary course of business. these legal proceedings may include, but are not limited to, proceedings related to consumer, shareholder, securities, employment, environmental, development, condominium conversion, tort, eviction and commercial legal issues.  litigation can be lengthy and expensive, and it can divert management's attention and resources. results cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable outcome in litigation could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations.
13
insurance policies can be costly and may not cover all losses, which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
the company's property, general liability and workers compensation insurance policies provide coverage with substantial per occurrence deductibles and/or self-insured retentions.  these self-insurance retentions can be a material portion of insurance losses in excess of the base deductibles.  while the company has previously purchased incremental insurance coverage in the event of multiple non-catastrophic occurrences within the same policy year, these substantial deductible and self-insured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential for uninsured losses and this additional multiple occurrences coverage may not be available at all or on commercially reasonable terms in the future.  we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate; however, there are certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program.  as a result, our financial results could be adversely affected and may vary significantly from period to period.
the company relies on third party insurance providers for its property, general liability, workers compensation and other insurance, and should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress, it could negatively impact their ability to pay claims under the company's policies.
earthquake risk:  our policies insuring against earthquake losses have substantial deductibles which are applied to the values of the buildings involved in the loss.  with the geographic concentration of our properties, a single earthquake affecting a market may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  we cannot assure that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels.  in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected property or market, as well as anticipated future revenue.
terrorism risk:  the company has terrorism insurance coverage which excludes losses from nuclear, biological and chemical attacks.  in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties, we could lose the revenues from the property, our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses.
catastrophic weather risk:  our properties may be located in areas that could experience catastrophic weather and other natural disasters from time to time, including wildfires, snow or ice storms, windstorms or hurricanes, flooding or other severe weather.  this severe weather and natural disasters could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which may not be covered or could exceed our insurance coverage.  exposure to this risk could also result in a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions.
climate change risk: to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our properties are located, we may experience severe weather, which may result in physical damage to or decrease the demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. should the impact of climate change be material in nature, significant property damage or destruction of our properties could result.  in addition, climate change could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in the availability of coverage, either of which could expose the company to even greater uninsured losses. our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. in addition, changes in federal, state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties.
provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control.
certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the then-prevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders.  this includes the ownership limit described below in this item 1a.  while our existing preferred shares/preference units do not have all of these provisions, any future series of preferred shares/preference units may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders.  our bylaws require certain information to be provided by any security holder, or persons acting in concert with such security holder, who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders, including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities.  these requirements could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders.  the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of the security holders.
regulatory and tax risks the adoption of, or changes, in rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations and eviction laws and regulations in our markets could have an adverse effect on our operations and property values.
various state and local governments have enacted and may continue to enact rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations which could limit our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees, either of which could have a retroactive effect. we continue to see increases in governments considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider rent control or rent stabilization
14
laws and regulations.  these regulations may also make changes to eviction and other tenants' rights laws and regulations that could have an adverse impact on our operations and property values.  in june 2019, the state of new york enacted rent control regulations known as the housing stability and tenant protection act of 2019.  in october 2019, the state of california enacted rent control regulations known as the tenant protection act of 2019.
compliance or failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in substantial costs.
our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements and federal, state and local accessibility requirements, including and in addition to those imposed by the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing act. noncompliance could result in fines, subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance. existing requirements could change and compliance with future requirements may require significant unanticipated expenditures that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
environmental problems are possible and can be costly.
federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require current or previous owners or operators of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances at such properties.  the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination.  these laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants.  even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred.  third parties may also sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site.  we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us, or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties.
changes in u.s. accounting standards may materially and adversely affect the reporting of our operations.
the company follows gaap, which is established by the financial accounting standards board ("fasb"), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the securities and exchange commission ("sec") as authoritative for publicly held companies.  the fasb and the sec create and interpret accounting standards and may issue new accounting pronouncements or change the interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements.  these changes could have a material impact on our reported consolidated results of operations and financial position.
any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could result in a decrease of our share price.
section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting.  if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have a negative impact on our share price.
our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders.
we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit.  many of these requirements, for which there is limited judicial and administrative interpretation, however, are highly technical and complex.  therefore, we cannot guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify as a reit in the future.  the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control.  to qualify as a reit, our assets must be substantially comprised of real estate assets as defined in the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), and related guidance and our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws.  we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90% of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains.
if we fail to qualify as a reit, we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates (including, for years prior to 2018, any alternative minimum tax) and would have to pay significant income taxes unless the internal revenue service ("irs") granted us relief under certain statutory provisions.  in addition, we would remain disqualified from taxation as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit.  we would therefore have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders and would no longer be required to make distributions to security holders.  this would likely have a significant negative impact on the value of our securities.
in addition, certain of our subsidiary entities have elected to be taxed as reits.  as such, each must separately satisfy all of the requirements to qualify for reit status.  if a subsidiary reit did not satisfy such requirements, and certain relief provisions did not apply, it would be taxed as a regular corporation and its income would be subject to u.s. federal income taxation.   failure to comply with these complex reit rules at the subsidiary reit level can have a material and detrimental impact to eqr's reit status.
15
gain on disposition of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business is subject to 100% tax.
any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax.  we do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions.  however, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction.  the irs may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties are prohibited transactions.  while we believe the irs would not prevail in any such dispute, if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction.  in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit.
we may be subject to legislative or regulatory tax changes that could negatively impact our financial condition.
at any time, u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be enacted or amended. we cannot predict if or when any new u.s. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing u.s. federal income tax law, irs and u.s. department of treasury regulations or administrative guidance, will be adopted or become effective and any such law, regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively.  the company and our shareholders could be negatively impacted by any such change in, or any new, u.s. federal income tax law, regulations or administrative guidance.
distribution requirements may limit our flexibility to manage our portfolio.
in order to maintain qualification as a reit under the code, a reit must annually distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its reit taxable income, excluding the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on amounts, if any, by which distributions we pay in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our net capital gains and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years.  we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement. we may be required from time to time, under certain circumstances, to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received.  we may incur a reduction in tax depreciation without a reduction in capital expenditures.  difficulties in meeting the 90% distribution requirement might arise due to competing demands for our funds or due to timing differences between tax reporting and cash distributions, because deductions may be disallowed, income may be reported before cash is received, expenses may have to be paid before a deduction is allowed or because the irs may make a determination that adjusts reported income.  in addition, gain from the sale of property may exceed the amount of cash received on a leverage-neutral basis.  a substantial increase to our taxable income may reduce the flexibility of the company to manage its portfolio through dispositions of properties other than through tax deferred transactions or cause the company to borrow funds or liquidate investments on unfavorable terms in order to meet these distribution requirements. if we fail to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, we would cease to be taxed as a reit, resulting in substantial tax-related liabilities.
we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes.
to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year.  to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification, our declaration of trust, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than five percent of the lesser of the number or value of any outstanding class of common or preferred shares (the "ownership limit"). absent an exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees, securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and the security holder's rights to distributions and to vote would terminate.  a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit.  the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and, therefore, could affect our security holders' ability to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for their shares.  to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an anti-takeover device, the company's ownership limit requires, rather than permits, the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the company's status as a reit.
tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company or our shareholders.
under certain circumstances we have made and/or may consider making in the future, a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year.  this election, which is provided for in the code, may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year.  however, this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability.
in order to retain liquidity and continue to satisfy the reit distribution requirements, the company could issue shares rather than pay a dividend entirely in cash to shareholders. the irs has published several rulings which have allowed reits to offer shareholders the choice between shares or cash as a form of payment of a dividend (an "elective stock dividend").  however, reits
16
are also permitted to limit the amount of cash paid to all shareholders to 20% of the total dividend paid.  therefore, it is possible that the total tax burden to shareholders resulting from an elective stock dividend may exceed the amount of cash received by the shareholder.
inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control.
certain provisions of maryland law applicable to reits prohibit "business combinations" (including certain issuances of equity securities) with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities, or with an affiliate who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the company's outstanding voting securities (an "interested shareholder"), or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder.  these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder.  after the five-year period, a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two super-majority shareholder votes unless, among other conditions, holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares.  as permitted by maryland law, however, the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving sam zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them.  consequently, the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us and/or any of them.  such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders.

the consolidated properties acquired were located in the seattle, new york, denver and boston markets.  the consolidated properties disposed of were located in the seattle, los angeles and new york markets and the sales generated an unlevered irr of 8.7%.  the consolidated properties development completions were located in the san francisco and washington d.c. markets.  finally, the company started construction on one consolidated project, located in the boston market, consisting of 469 apartment units totaling approximately $409.7 million of expected development costs.
see the definitions section below for the definition of acquisition cap rate, development yield, disposition yield and unlevered irr.  see also note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company's real estate transactions.
the company's guidance assumes consolidated rental acquisitions of $1.25 billion and consolidated rental dispositions of $1.0 billion, and the company expects that the acquisition cap rate will be 0.25% lower than the disposition yield for the full year ending december 31, 2020.  we currently budget spending approximately $365.0 million on development costs during the year ending december 31, 2020 (inclusive of approximately $50.0 million of construction mortgage and joint venture partner obligations), primarily for properties currently under construction.
same store results properties that the company owned and were stabilized (see definition below) for all of both 2019 and 2018 (the "2019 same store properties"), which represented 71,830 apartment units, impacted the company's results of operations.  the 2019 same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs.
the company's primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income ("noi").  noi represents rental income less direct property operating expenses (including real estate taxes and insurance).  the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the company's apartment properties.

same store revenues for the full year of 2019 were slightly lower than our most recent expectations but still performed at the high end of our expectations from the beginning of the year.  revenue increased due to record low turnover, strong occupancy and favorable overall demand.  the company's primary focus in 2019 was on providing remarkable experiences for our residents which resulted in record levels of customer satisfaction and resident retention.  the company's primary goals for 2020 will be to continue the 2019 trends while accelerating the deployment of various operating initiatives such as smart home technology and other sales and service related innovation improvements.   we expect consistent demand that should help with the absorption of the continued elevated supply that we expect in many of our markets.
new rent control regulations enacted in both the new york and california markets during 2019 are expected to negatively impact our overall same store revenue results by approximately 20 basis points for 2020. of the approximately 9,600 apartment units located in our new york market, approximately 3,100 apartment units are "rent stabilized" (primarily as a result of the 421(a) real estate tax abatement program) and therefore more directly impacted by these new regulations.  once the abatement expires, the apartment units can be brought to market rents and will no longer be subject to the rent control regulations.  we estimate that the new regulations will have a negative impact on renewal rates for some of these 3,100 apartment units and will impact our ability to charge certain fees at all of our new york city properties (approximately 6,600 apartment units).  california's new rent control regulations, which became effective on january 1, 2020, among other things limits the ability to raise rents on renewals to the local california consumer price index + 5% on properties fifteen years or older.  it does not, however, impose such a cap upon vacancy of an apartment unit.  of our approximately 37,600 apartment units located in california, approximately 24,400 are subject to these new regulations.
boston performed better than expected with strong demand across the market.  strong occupancy, new lease and renewal pricing increases drove our improved performance in 2019. however, with competitive new supply pressures increasing in 2020, we anticipate consistent occupancy but less growth from renewals and new leases that will lead to lower anticipated overall same store revenue growth levels in 2020.
strong occupancy and pricing power continued to improve in new york as 2019 progressed.  this market, however, experienced some seasonal softness near year-end, resulting in a concessionary environment that was greater than expected.  for 2020, while we continue to believe the new rent control regulations will have a modestly negative impact on our new york market results, we expect overall same store revenue growth to improve from 2019 as pricing power returns to the market given the anticipated almost complete lack of competitive new supply.  additionally, we expect slightly higher occupancy and renewal rates, favorable market conditions and new lease growth in 2020.
washington d.c. continued to demonstrate strength in demand with strong occupancy, renewal rates achieved and new lease change despite elevated supply in 2019.  the economy, particularly in northern virginia, remains strong with gains in the professional and business services sector which are aiding in the absorption of new supply being delivered.  in 2020, we anticipate improved results mostly driven by stronger embedded growth starting the year and similar operating outcomes for occupancy, new lease change and achieved renewal increase.
the seattle market performed better than expected due to stronger than anticipated demand despite elevated new supply.  job growth continued to be very strong and we experienced the highest occupancy gains, renewal rates achieved and new lease pricing of any of our markets in 2019.  we expect to produce better same store revenue growth in 2020 with similar occupancy, slight improvement to achieved renewal rates and the majority of growth coming from gains in new leases as we look to capitalize on the current and near-term pricing power in the portfolio.
28
san francisco performed slightly below our most recent expectations due to lower occupancy and elevated supply, especially in the east bay, impacting performance towards the end of 2019.  while these trends are consistent with normal seasonal declines, they were modestly more pronounced.  in 2020, we expect similar new supply levels with the concentration of competitive supply impacting the downtown and south bay areas the most.  expected revenue growth in 2020 is lower compared to 2019 due to the impact of this new supply and the new rent control regulations.  while we expect some softness when new supply is concentrated around us, this market has a critical mass of technology talent and growth drivers for strong long-term performance.
while the los angeles market continued to maintain steady occupancy and solid renewal rates, the market performed slightly below our expectations due to pricing power declines and negative new lease changes as new supply was delivered during the second half of 2019.  we expect los angeles to be our most challenged market in 2020 due to elevated new supply, implementation of the new rent control regulations and restrictions on short-term lease pricing.  therefore, we expect slightly lower occupancy, modest gains in new lease change and a decline in renewal rate achieved growth.
in orange county, results continued to be strong and in line with our expectations primarily due to high occupancy levels and in-line renewal rate achieved and new lease change.  our properties performed well against competitive new supply during 2019.  for 2020, we expect to deliver similar occupancy, slight gains in new lease change and a decline in renewal rate achieved growth due to the impact of the new rent control regulations, leading to expected 2020 results below 2019. with strong occupancy, we believe that we are well-positioned heading into a competitive environment.
in san diego, occupancy was better than expected but renewal rate achieved and new lease pricing were both lower than anticipated, resulting in same store revenue slightly below our expectations.  overall, military spending in this market remains strong but supply pressure limits our pricing power.  we expect to deliver strong but lower same store revenue growth in 2020 with similar occupancy, slight gains in new lease change and a decline in renewal rate achieved growth based on the impact of the new rent control regulations.  with strong occupancy, we believe that we are well-positioned heading into a competitive environment.

(1)   on-site payroll - includes payroll and related expenses for on-site personnel including property managers, leasing consultants and maintenance staff.

(2)   utilities - represents gross expenses prior to any recoveries under the resident utility billing system ("rubs"). recoveries are reflected in rental income.

(3)   repairs and maintenance - includes general maintenance costs, apartment unit turnover costs including interior painting, routine landscaping, security, exterminating, fire protection, snow removal, elevator, roof and parking lot repairs and other miscellaneous building repair and maintenance costs.

(4)   other on-site operating expenses - includes ground lease costs and administrative costs such as office supplies, telephone and data charges and association and business licensing fees.

(5)   the changes are due primarily to:

•   real estate taxes - increase above expectations due primarily to fewer recoveries from appeals activity.

•   on-site payroll - increase below expectations. payroll pressures continue but were offset by lower than expected employee benefit-related costs.

•   utilities - growth generally in line with expectations for the year.

29
•   insurance - increase due to higher premiums on property insurance renewal as a result of challenging conditions in the insurance market.

•   other on-site operating expenses - increase primarily driven by higher ground lease costs due to a contractual revaluation at one property along with higher association fees.

same store expenses increased 3.7% during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, which was towards the low end of our original expectations (3.5% to 4.5%) and slightly lower than our most recent guidance provided in october 2019 (3.8%).
we anticipate same store expenses to increase between 3.0% to 4.0% for 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to the following items:
•   real estate taxes are estimated to remain elevated with an increase between 3.75% and 4.75% primarily due to the 421-a tax abatement benefits continuing to burn-off in new york, a slight decline in forecasted year-over-year appeals activity and anticipated rate pressure in seattle;

•   payroll costs are estimated to increase approximately 2.25% to 3.25% primarily due to continued pressures from a tight labor market and anticipated increases in medical insurance and other employee benefits due to these costs being lower than expected in 2019. excluding these anticipated medical expense/benefit pressures, we would expect growth to be very modest;

•   utilities are estimated to increase between 2.5% and 3.5% primarily due to continued modest commodity cost pressures along with increases in trash and sewer costs; and

•   repairs and maintenance costs are estimated to increase between 2.5% and 3.5% primarily due to significant pressure from increases in minimum wages for contract labor and additional cost from our operating initiatives offset by forecasted better utilization of our internal workforce.

same store noi increased 3.0% for the full year 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, which was at the high end of our original expectations (1.5% to 3.0%) and slightly lower than our most recent guidance provided in october 2019 (3.1%).  the company anticipates same store noi growth for the full year 2020 of approximately 1.5% to 3.5% as a result of the same store revenue and expense expectations discussed above.
see also note 17 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company's segment disclosures.
non-same store/other results non-same store/other noi results for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased approximately $46.9 million compared to the same period of 2018 and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2018 and 2019, operations from the company's development properties and operations prior to disposition from 2018 and 2019 sold properties.  this difference is due primarily to:
•   a positive impact of higher noi from development and newly stabilized development properties in lease-up of $13.4 million;

•   a positive impact of higher noi from properties mainly acquired in 2018 and 2019 of $53.2 million;

•   a positive impact of higher noi from other non-same store properties (including one current and two former master leased properties) of $0.8 million; and

•   a negative impact of lost noi from 2018 and 2019 dispositions of $31.7 million.

(1)   consolidated operating expenses are comprised of property and maintenance and real estate taxes and insurance.

property management expenses include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the company's properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies.  these expenses increased approximately $2.9 million or 3.1% during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018.  these increases are primarily attributable to increases in legal and professional fees, computer operations and education/conferences cost.  the company anticipates that property management expenses will approximate $100.0 million to $102.0 million for the year ending december 31, 2020, inclusive of $1.5 million of additional expenses for various operating initiatives such as sales-focused improvements and service enhancements along with personnel costs to support these initiatives.
general and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, decreased approximately $1.1 million or 2.0% during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to decreases in payroll-related costs, partially offset by increases in office rent.  the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate $50.0 million to $52.0 million for the year ending december 31, 2020.
depreciation expense, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased approximately $45.4 million or 5.8% during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2018 and 2019 and development properties placed in service during 2018 and 2019, offset by lower depreciation from properties sold in 2018 and 2019.
net gain on sales of real estate properties increased approximately $190.8 million or 74.3% during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily as a result of a higher sales volume with the sale of eleven consolidated apartment properties in 2019 as compared to five consolidated apartment properties in 2018.
interest and other income decreased approximately $12.5 million or 81.6% during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to a decline in insurance/litigation settlement proceeds received during 2019 as compared to 2018.  the company anticipates that interest and other income will approximate $1.5 million to $2.0 million for the year ending december 31, 2020, excluding certain non-comparable insurance/litigation settlement proceeds.
other expenses increased approximately $0.9 million or 5.3% during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in expenses related to litigation settlements, pursuit costs and various consulting costs related to a data analytics project, partially offset by a decrease in advocacy contributions in 2019 as compared to 2018.
interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased approximately $22.9 million or 5.4% during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018.  the decrease is due primarily to $17.3 million in lower debt extinguishment costs in 2019 as compared to 2018.  the effective interest cost on all indebtedness, excluding debt extinguishment costs/prepayment
31
penalties, for the year ended december 31, 2019 was 4.20% as compared to 4.32% in 2018.  the company capitalized interest of approximately $6.9 million and $6.3 million during the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  the company anticipates that interest expense, excluding debt extinguishment costs/prepayment penalties, will approximate $340.0 million to $348.0 million and capitalized interest will approximate $12.0 million to $14.0 million for the year ending december 31, 2020.
income and other tax benefit increased approximately $3.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to various alternative minimum tax credit refunds recognized in 2019 that did not occur in 2018.  the company anticipates that income and other tax expense will approximate $0.7 million to $1.2 million for the year ending december 31, 2020.
income from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately $69.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily as a result of a $69.5 million gain on the sale of two unconsolidated properties in 2019 that did not occur in 2018.
net gain on sales of land parcels increased approximately $1.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to a higher gain on the sale of two land parcels in 2019 as compared to one land parcel sale in 2018.
for comparison of the year ended december 31, 2018 to the year ended december 31, 2017, refer to item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, included in the company's and the operating partnership's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018.
liquidity and capital resources short-term liquidity and cash proceeds the company generally expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility and commercial paper program.  under normal operating conditions, the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions.
as of january 1, 2019, the company had approximately $47.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $68.9 million of restricted deposits, and the available borrowing capacity on its revolving credit facility was $1.40 billion.  after the effect of the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities, at december 31, 2019, the company's cash and cash equivalents balance was approximately $45.8 million, the restricted deposits balance was approximately $71.2 million and the available borrowing capacity on its revolving credit facility was $1.38 billion.  see note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the availability on the company's revolving credit facility.
during the year ended december 31, 2019, the company generated proceeds from various transactions, which included the following:
•   disposed of eleven consolidated rental properties, two unconsolidated rental properties and two land parcels, receiving combined net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion;

•   obtained $295.8 million of mortgage loan proceeds;

•   issued $600.0 million of ten-year 3.00% unsecured notes, receiving net proceeds of approximately $597.5 million before underwriting fees, hedge termination costs and other expenses;

•   issued $600.0 million of ten-year 2.50% unsecured notes, receiving net proceeds of approximately $597.0 million before underwriting fees and other expenses; and

•   issued common shares related to share option exercises and espp purchases and received net proceeds of $80.9 million, which were contributed to the capital of the operating partnership in exchange for additional op units (on a one-for-one common share per op unit basis).

during the year ended december 31, 2019, the above proceeds along with net cash flow from operations and borrowings from the company's revolving line of credit and commercial paper program were primarily utilized to:
•   acquire thirteen consolidated rental properties and four land parcels for approximately $1.5 billion in cash;

•   invest $195.7 million primarily in development projects;

•   repay $749.8 million of mortgage loans (inclusive of scheduled principal repayments) and incur prepayment penalties of approximately $3.4 million; and

•   repay $1.1 billion of unsecured notes and incur prepayment penalties of approximately $10.3 million.

32
credit facility and commercial paper program the company has a $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing november 1, 2024.  the company has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional $750.0 million by adding lenders to the facility, obtaining the agreement of existing lenders to increase their commitments or incurring one or more term loans.  the interest rate on advances under the facility will generally be libor plus a spread (currently 0.775%), or based on bids received from the lending group, and the company pays a quarterly facility fee (currently 0.125%).  both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the company's senior unsecured credit rating.
the unsecured revolving credit agreement contains provisions that establish a process for entering into an amendment to replace libor under certain circumstances, such as the anticipated phase-out of libor by the end of 2021. at this time, it cannot be determined what interest rate(s) may succeed libor, if any, and how any successor or alternative rates for libor may affect borrowing costs or the availability of variable interest rate borrowings.
the company has an unsecured commercial paper note program in the united states.  the company may borrow up to a maximum of $1.0 billion under this program subject to market conditions.  the notes will be sold under customary terms in the united states commercial paper note market and will rank pari passu with all of the company's other unsecured senior indebtedness.
the company limits its utilization of the revolving credit facility in order to maintain liquidity to support its $1.0 billion commercial paper program along with certain other obligations.  the following table presents the availability on the company's unsecured revolving credit facility as of february 14, 2020 (amounts in thousands):

dividend policy the company determines its dividends/distributions based on actual and projected financial conditions, the company's actual and projected liquidity and operating results, the company's projected cash needs for capital expenditures and other investment activities and such other factors as the company's board of trustees deems relevant.  the company declared a dividend/distribution for each quarter in 2019 of $0.5675 per share/unit, an annualized increase of 5.1% over the amount paid in 2018.  this increase is supported by the company's strong growth in property operations and a significant reduction in its development activity resulting in a material increase in available cash flow.  the company's 2019 operating cash flow was sufficient to cover capital expenditures and regular dividends/distributions.
the company expects to declare a dividend/distribution of $0.6025 per share/unit for the first quarter of 2020, an annualized increase of 6.2% over the amount paid in 2019.  this increase is driven by the company's continued strong cash flow performance, solid balance sheet and modest payout ratio.  the company believes that its expected 2020 operating cash flow will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures and regular dividends/distributions.  all future dividends/distributions remain subject to the discretion of the company's board of trustees.
total dividends/distributions paid in january 2020 amounted to $218.3 million (excluding distributions on partially owned properties), which consisted of certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended december 31, 2019.
long-term financing and capital needs the company expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements, such as lump sum unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions and financing of development activities, through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities, including additional op units, proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and cash generated from operations after all distributions.  in addition, the company has a significant number of unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that unsecured capital is unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high.  the value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit.  of the $27.5 billion in investment in real estate on the company's balance sheet at december 31, 2019, $23.9 billion or 86.9% was unencumbered.  however, there can be no assurances that these sources of capital will be available to the company in the future on acceptable terms or otherwise.

eqr and erpop currently have an active universal shelf registration statement for the issuance of equity and debt securities that automatically became effective upon filing with the sec in june 2019 and expires in june 2022.  per the terms of erpop's partnership agreement, eqr contributes the net proceeds of all equity offerings to the capital of erpop in exchange for additional op units (on a one-for-one common share per op unit basis) or preference units (on a one-for-one preferred share per preference unit basis).
the company has an at-the-market ("atm") share offering program which allows eqr to sell common shares from time to time into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions.  in june 2019, the company extended the program maturity to june 2022.  in connection with the extension, the company may now also sell common shares under forward sale agreements.  the use of a forward sale agreement would allow the company to lock in a price on the sale of common shares at the time the agreement is executed, but defer receiving the proceeds from the sale until a later date.  eqr has the authority to issue 13.0 million shares but has not issued any shares under this program since september 2012.  eqr may, but shall have no obligation to, sell common shares through the atm share offering program in amounts and at times to be determined by eqr.  actual sales will depend on a variety of factors, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of eqr's common shares and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding for eqr. through february 14, 2020, eqr has cumulatively issued approximately 16.7 million common shares at an average price of $48.53 per share for total consideration of approximately $809.9 million.
the company may repurchase up to 13.0 million common shares under its share repurchase program.  no open market repurchases have occurred since 2008, and no repurchases of any kind have occurred since february 2014.  eqr may, but shall have no obligation to, repurchase common shares through the share repurchase program in amounts and at times to be determined by eqr.  actual repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of eqr's common shares and other opportunities for the investment of available capital.  as of february 14, 2020, eqr has remaining authorization to repurchase up to 13.0 million of its shares.
erpop's long-term senior debt ratings and short-term commercial paper ratings as well as eqr's long-term preferred equity ratings, which all have a stable outlook, as of february 14, 2020 are as follows:

capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property.  we track improvements to real estate in three major categories and several subcategories:
▪   replacements (inside the apartment unit). these include:

•   flooring such as carpets, hardwood, vinyl or tile;

36
•   appliances;

•   mechanical equipment such as individual furnace/air units, hot water heaters, smoke/carbon monoxide/water alarms, etc.;

•   furniture and fixtures such as kitchen/bath cabinets, light fixtures, ceiling fans, sinks, tubs, toilets, mirrors, countertops, etc.; and

•   blinds and window coverings.

all replacements are depreciated over a five to ten-year estimated useful life.  we expense as incurred all make-ready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting of individual apartment units and the repair of any replacement item noted above.
▪   building improvements (outside the apartment unit). these include:

•   roof replacement and major repairs;

•   paving or major resurfacing of parking lots, curbs and sidewalks;

•   amenities and common areas such as pools, exterior sports and playground equipment, lobbies, clubhouses, laundry rooms, alarm and security systems and offices;

•   major building mechanical equipment systems;

•   interior and exterior structural repair and exterior painting and siding;

•   major landscaping and grounds improvement; and

•   vehicles and office and maintenance equipment.

all building improvements are depreciated over a five to fifteen-year estimated useful life.  we capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item: (i) exceeds $2,500 (selected projects may be restricted by other thresholds); (ii) extends the useful life of the asset; and (iii) improves the value of the asset.
the third major category is renovations, which primarily consists of expenditures for kitchens and baths designed to reposition the apartment units/properties for higher rental levels in their respective markets.  all renovation expenditures are depreciated over a ten-year estimated useful life.

(1)   total apartment units - excludes 945 unconsolidated apartment units for which capital expenditures to real estate are self-funded and do not consolidate into the company's results.

(2)   building improvements - includes roof replacement, paving, building mechanical equipment systems, exterior siding and painting, major landscaping, furniture, fixtures and equipment for amenities and common areas, vehicles and office and maintenance equipment.

(3)   renovation expenditures - apartment unit renovation costs (primarily kitchens and baths) designed to reposition these units for higher rental levels in their respective markets. amounts for 2,850 same store apartment units approximated $13,800 per apartment unit renovated.

(4)   replacements - includes appliances, mechanical equipment, fixtures and flooring (including hardwood and carpeting).

(5)   same store properties - primarily includes all properties acquired or completed that are stabilized prior to january 1, 2017, less properties subsequently sold.

(6)   non-same store properties/other - primarily includes all properties acquired during 2017 and 2018, plus any properties in lease-up and not stabilized as of january 1, 2017. also includes capital expenditures for properties sold.

the company estimates that during 2020 it will spend approximately $2,600 per same store apartment unit or $195.0 million of total capital expenditures to real estate for same store properties.  included in these total expected expenditures are approximately $50.0 million for apartment unit renovation expenditures on approximately 2,500 same store apartment units at an average cost of approximately $20,000 per apartment unit renovated and approximately $10.0 million on smart home technology upgrades on approximately 10,000 same store apartment units at an average cost of approximately $1,000 per apartment unit.  the anticipated total capital expenditures to real estate for same store properties represent a higher absolute and per unit dollar amount and percentage of same store revenues as compared to 2019, primarily due to the higher expected renovation expenditures and smart home technology upgrades.
during the year ended december 31, 2019, the company's total non-real estate capital additions, such as computer software, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the company's property management offices and its corporate offices, were approximately $5.0 million.  the company expects to fund approximately $22.7 million in total non-real estate capital additions in 2020.  these anticipated fundings are significantly higher than 2019 and are primarily driven by corporate office renovations during 2020.
derivative instruments in the normal course of business, the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes.  the company may seek to manage these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.  the company may also use derivatives to manage commodity prices in the daily operations of the business.
the company has a policy of only entering into derivative contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors.  when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives it currently has in place.

definitions the definition of certain terms described above or below are as follows:
•   acquisition cap rate - noi that the company anticipates receiving in the next 12 months (or the year two or three stabilized noi for properties that are in lease-up at acquisition) less an estimate of property management costs/management fees allocated to the project (generally ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% of revenues depending on the size and income streams of the asset) and less an estimate for in-the-unit replacement capital expenditures (generally ranging from $100-$450 per apartment unit depending on the age and condition of the asset) divided by the gross purchase price of the asset. the weighted average acquisition cap rate for acquired properties is weighted based on the projected noi streams and the relative purchase price for each respective property.

•   development yield - noi that the company anticipates receiving in the next 12 months following stabilization less an estimate of property management costs/management fees allocated to the project (generally ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% of revenues depending on the size and income streams of the asset) and less an estimate for in-the-unit replacement capital expenditures (generally ranging from $50-$150 per apartment unit depending on the type of asset) divided by the total budgeted capital cost of the asset. the weighted average development yield for development properties is weighted based on the projected noi streams and the relative total budgeted capital cost for each respective property.

•   disposition yield - noi that the company anticipates giving up in the next 12 months less an estimate of property management costs/management fees allocated to the project (generally ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% of revenues depending on the size and income streams of the asset) and less an estimate for in-the-unit replacement capital expenditures (generally ranging from $100-$450 per apartment unit depending on the age and condition of the asset) divided by the gross sales price of the asset. the weighted average disposition yield for sold properties is weighted based on the projected noi streams and the relative sales price for each respective property.

•   unlevered internal rate of return ("irr") - the unlevered irr on sold properties is the compound annual rate of return calculated by the company based on the timing and amount of: (i) the gross purchase price of the property plus any direct acquisition costs incurred by the company; (ii) total revenues earned during the company's ownership period; (iii) total direct property operating expenses (including real estate taxes and insurance) incurred during the company's ownership period; (iv) capital expenditures incurred during the company's ownership period; and (v) the gross sales price of the property net of selling costs.

•   weighted average coupons - contractual interest rate for each debt instrument weighted by principal balances as of december 31, 2019. in case of debt for which fair value hedges are in place, the rate payable under the corresponding derivatives is used in lieu of the contractual interest rate.

•   weighted average rates - interest expense for each debt instrument for the year ended december 31, 2019 weighted by its average principal balance for the same period. interest expense includes amortization of premiums, discounts and other comprehensive income on debt and related derivative instruments. in case of debt for which derivatives are in place, the income or expense recognized under the corresponding derivatives is included in the total interest expense for the period.

off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company has various unconsolidated interests in certain joint ventures.  the company does not believe that these unconsolidated investments have a materially different impact on its liquidity, cash flows, capital resources, credit or market risk than its consolidated operating and/or other activities.  see also note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company's investments in partially owned entities.  see also note 16 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding the company's development projects.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions.  if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements.
the company's significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.  these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december 31, 2019.
the company has identified the significant accounting policies below as critical accounting policies.  these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates.  with respect to these critical accounting policies, management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented.
impairment of long-lived assets the company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investment in real estate, for indicators of impairment.  the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions, legal, regulatory and environmental concerns, the company's intent and ability to hold the related asset, as well as any significant cost overruns on development properties.  future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.  assessing impairment can be complex and involves a high degree of subjectivity in determining if indicators are present and in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows or the fair value of an asset.  in particular, these estimates are sensitive to significant assumptions, including the estimation of future rental revenues, operating expenses, discount and capitalization rates and our intent and ability to hold the related asset, all of which could be affected by our expectations about future market or economic conditions.  these estimates can have a significant impact on the undiscounted cash flows or estimated fair value of an asset.
acquisition of investment properties the company allocates the purchase price of properties that meet the definition of an asset acquisition to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their relative fair values.  in making estimates of relative fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data.  the company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the relative fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.

(1)   the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") defines funds from operations ("ffo") (december 2018 white paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap")), excluding gains or losses from sales and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate and land when connected to the main business of a reit, impairment write-downs of investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and depreciation and amortization related to real estate. adjustments for partially owned consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis.

(2)   normalized funds from operations ("normalized ffo") begins with ffo and excludes:

•   the impact of any expenses relating to non-operating asset impairment;

•   pursuit cost write-offs;

•   gains and losses from early debt extinguishment and preferred share redemptions;

•   gains and losses from non-operating assets; and

•   other miscellaneous items.

(3)   the company believes that ffo and ffo available to common shares and units / units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses from sales and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate and excluding depreciation related to real estate (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), ffo and ffo available to common shares and units / units can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. the company also believes that normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units / units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they allow investors to compare the company's operating performance to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the company's actual operating results. ffo, ffo available to common shares and units / units, normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units / units do not represent net income, net income available to common shares / units or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap. therefore, ffo, ffo available to common shares and units / units, normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units / units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to common shares / units or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap or as a measure of liquidity. the company's calculation of ffo, ffo available to common shares and units / units, normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units / units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

(4)   ffo available to common shares and units / units and normalized ffo available to common shares and units / units are calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to common shares / units and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares/preference units in accordance with gaap. the equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the operating partnership in exchange for op units are collectively referred to as the "noncontrolling interests - operating partnership". subject to certain restrictions, the noncontrolling interests - operating partnership may exchange their op units for common shares on a one-for-one basis.

item 1a: risk factors the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to grainger's business that could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k and should not be considered the only risks to which the company is exposed.
weakness in the economy, market trends and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of grainger's customers could negatively impact grainger's sales growth and results of operations.
economic, political, and industry trends affect grainger's business environments. grainger serves several industries and markets in which the demand for its products and services is sensitive to the production activity, capital spending and demand for products and services of grainger's customers. many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to cyclical fluctuations resulting from market uncertainty, trade and tariff policies, costs of goods sold, currency exchange rates, central bank interest rate changes, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, labor shortages, inflation, deflation, and a variety of other factors beyond grainger's control. any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities, delay purchases, reduce production levels, or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services.
any of these events could also reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from grainger or impair the ability of grainger's customers to make full and timely payments, and could cause increased pressure on grainger's selling prices and terms of sale. accordingly, a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity in the u.s., canada or any other major world economy, or a segment of any such economy, could negatively impact grainger's sales growth and results of operations.
the facilities maintenance industry is highly competitive, and changes in competition could result in decreased demand for grainger's products and services.
grainger competes in a variety of ways, including product assortment and availability, services offered to customers, pricing, purchasing convenience, and the overall experience grainger offers. this includes the ease of use of grainger's high-touch high-service operations (branches and digital platforms) and delivery of products.
there are several large competitors in the industry, although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors. grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers (including some of its own suppliers) that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, catalog houses, retail enterprises and online businesses that compete with price transparency.
to remain competitive, the company must be willing and able to respond to market pressures. downward pressure on sales prices, changes in the volume of our orders, and an inability to pass higher product costs on to customers could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline. we may not be able to pass rising product costs to customers if those customers have ready product or supplier alternatives in the marketplace. these pressures could have a material effect on grainger's sales and profitability. if the company is unable to grow sales or reduce costs, among other actions, the company's results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
moreover, grainger expects technological advancements and the increased use of ecommerce solutions within the industry to continue to evolve at a rapid pace. as a result, grainger's ability to effectively compete requires grainger to respond and adapt to new industry trends and developments. implementing new technology and innovations may result in unexpected costs and interruptions to operations, may take longer than expected, and may not provide all anticipated benefits.
volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect gross margins.
some of grainger's products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, such as steel, copper, petroleum derivatives, or rare earth minerals, and are subject to price changes based on fluctuations in the commodities market. fluctuations in the price of fuel could affect transportation costs. grainger's ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions. the inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins. in addition, higher prices could reduce demand for these products, resulting in lower sales volumes.
9
unexpected product shortages, tariffs, and risks associated with grainger's suppliers could negatively impact customer relationships or result in an adverse impact on results of operations.
grainger's competitive strengths include product selection and availability. products are purchased from approximately 5,000 suppliers located in various countries around the world, not one of which accounted for more than 5% of total purchases.
historically, no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply; however, disruptions could occur due to factors beyond grainger's control, including economic downturns, geopolitical unrest, tariffs, new tariffs or tariff increases, trade issues and policies, labor problems experienced by grainger's suppliers, transportation availability and cost, shortage of raw materials, inflation and other factors, any of which could adversely affect a supplier's ability to manufacture or deliver products or could result in an increase in grainger's product costs.
further, grainger sources products from asia and other areas of the world. this increases the risk of supply disruption due to the additional lead time required and distances involved.
if grainger was to experience difficulty in obtaining products, there could be a short-term adverse effect on results of operations and a longer-term adverse effect on customer relationships and grainger's reputation. in addition, grainger has strategic relationships with a number of vendors. in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations, there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could, in turn, adversely affect results of operations.
changes in customer base or product mix could cause changes in grainger's gross margin or affect grainger's competitive position.
from time to time, grainger experiences changes in customer base and product mix that affect gross margin. changes in customer base and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions, changes in customer demand, customer acquisitions, selling and marketing activities, competition and the increased use of ecommerce by grainger and its competitors. there can be no assurance that grainger will be able to maintain historical gross margins in the future.
additionally, as customer base and product mix change over time, grainger must identify new products, product lines and services that respond to industry trends and customer needs. the inability to introduce new products and effectively integrate them into grainger's existing product mix could have a negative impact on future sales growth and grainger's competitive position.
disruptions in grainger's supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations.
the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as earthquakes, storms, hurricanes, floods, fires, droughts, tornados and other extreme weather; pandemic diseases or viral contagions such as the coronavirus outbreak; geopolitical events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which grainger operates or in which its suppliers are located; and the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade could result in disruption of grainger's logistics or supply chain network. for example, should the coronavirus outbreak persist or spread, it could disrupt the operations of the company and its suppliers and customers. any such disruption or other catastrophic event could cause one or more of grainger's distribution centers or branches to become non-operational, adversely affect grainger's ability to obtain or deliver inventory in a timely manner, impair grainger's ability to meet customer demand for products, result in lost sales, additional costs, or penalties, or damage grainger's reputation. grainger's ability to provide same-day shipping and next-day delivery is an integral component of grainger's business strategy and any such disruption could adversely impact results of operations and financial performance.
interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues.
the proper functioning of grainger's information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business. grainger continues to invest in software, hardware and network infrastructures in order to effectively manage its information systems. although grainger's information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems, including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities, information systems are still vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power losses, telecommunication failures, user error, third party actions
10
such as malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks and cybersecurity breaches, and other problems. in addition, from time to time grainger relies on the it systems of third parties to assist in conducting its business.
if grainger's systems or those of third parties on which grainger depends are damaged, breached or cease to function properly grainger may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and may suffer interruptions in its business operations in the interim. if critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable, grainger's ability to operate its ecommerce platforms, process orders, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, disburse funds, manage its supply chain, monitor results of operations, and process and store employee or customer data, among other functions, could be adversely affected. any such interruption of grainger's information systems could have a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations.
cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, could damage grainger's reputation, disrupt operations, increase costs and/or decrease revenues.
through grainger's sales and ecommerce channels, grainger collects and stores personally identifiable, confidential, proprietary and other information from customers so that they may, among other things, purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on grainger's websites or otherwise communicate or interact with the company. moreover, grainger's operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business, customers, suppliers and employees, and other sensitive matters.
cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in the company's information systems.
moreover, from time to time, grainger may share information with vendors and other third parties that assist with certain aspects of the business. while grainger requires assurances that these vendors and other parties will protect confidential information, there is a risk that the confidentiality of data held or accessed by them may be compromised. if successful, those attempting to penetrate grainger's or its vendors' information systems may misappropriate intellectual property or personally identifiable, credit card, confidential, proprietary or other sensitive customer, supplier, employee or business information, or cause systems disruption.
in addition, a grainger employee, contractor or other third party with whom grainger does business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. further, grainger's systems are integrated with customer systems in certain cases, and a breach of the company's information systems could be used to gain illicit access to customer systems and information.
while grainger has instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, grainger may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. any breach of grainger's security measures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of its third party service providers could cause grainger to incur significant costs to protect any customers, suppliers, employees, and other parties whose personal data is compromised and to make changes to its information systems and administrative processes to address security issues.
loss of customer, supplier, employee or intellectual property or other business information or failure to comply with data privacy and security laws could disrupt operations, damage grainger's reputation and expose grainger to claims from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees and others, any of which could have a material adverse effect on grainger, its financial condition and results of operations. in the past, grainger has experienced certain cybersecurity incidents. in each instance, grainger provided notifications and adopted remedial measures. while these incidents have not been deemed to be material to grainger, there can be no assurance that a future breach or incident would not be material to grainger's operations and financial condition.
grainger's ability to adequately protect its intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims by others may have an adverse impact on operations.
grainger's business relies on the use, validity and continued protection of certain proprietary information and intellectual property, which includes current and future patents, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, copyrights and confidentiality agreements as well as license and sublicense agreements to use intellectual property owned by affiliated entities or third parties. unauthorized use of grainger's intellectual property by others could result in harm to various
11
aspects of the business and may result in costly and protracted litigation in order to protect grainger's rights. in addition, grainger may be subject to claims that it has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, which could subject grainger to liability, require grainger to obtain licenses to use those rights at significant cost or otherwise cause grainger to modify its operations.
fluctuations in foreign currency could have an effect on reported results of operations.
grainger's exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. while the consolidated financial statements are reported in u.s. dollars, the financial statements of grainger's subsidiaries outside the u.s. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into u.s. dollars. in addition, grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to the u.s. dollar relative to the local currencies of grainger's international subsidiaries, primarily the canadian dollar, euro, pound sterling, mexican peso, renminbi and yen, arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries, sales to customers, purchases from suppliers, and bank loans and lines of credit denominated in foreign currencies. grainger also has foreign currency exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in a subsidiary's functional currency and that could have an impact on sales, costs and cash flows. these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect grainger's results of operations and impact reported net sales and net earnings.
an inability to successfully implement grainger's strategy or to integrate acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures and other business combination transactions could result in the benefits anticipated not being realized and could have an adverse effect on results of operations.
grainger has implemented and is implementing several initiatives to increase sales and earnings. if grainger is unable to successfully implement these initiatives, grainger's business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures and other business combination transactions, both foreign and domestic, involve various inherent risks, such as uncertainties in assessing value, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities and potential profitability. there is also risk relating to grainger's ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from the transactions. additionally, problems could arise from the integration of acquired businesses, including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic or political conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition. any one or more of these factors could cause grainger to not realize the benefits anticipated or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units. accordingly, goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could, and have in the past, become impaired.
in order to compete, grainger must attract, retain and motivate key employees, and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations.
in order to compete and have continued growth, grainger must attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing and support positions. grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. grainger's results of operations could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs.
grainger's continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of grainger's reputation.
one of the reasons why customers choose to do business with grainger and why employees choose grainger as a place of employment is the reputation that grainger has built over many years. to be successful in the future, grainger must continue to preserve, grow and leverage the value of grainger's brand. reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities. even an isolated incident, or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents, can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, and as a result, could tarnish grainger's brand and lead to adverse effects on grainger's business.
12
grainger is subject to various domestic and foreign laws, regulations and standards. failure to comply or unforeseen developments in related contingencies such as litigation could adversely affect grainger's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
grainger's business is subject to legislative, legal, and regulatory risks and conditions specific to the countries in which it operates. in addition to grainger's u.s. operations, which in 2019 generated approximately 72% of its consolidated net sales, grainger operates its business principally through wholly-owned subsidiaries in canada, china, germany, mexico, the netherlands, and the united kingdom, and its majority-owned subsidiary in japan.
the wide array of laws, regulations and standards in each domestic and foreign jurisdiction where grainger operates, include, but are not limited to: advertising and marketing regulations, anti-bribery and corruption laws, anti-competition regulations, data protection (including, because grainger accepts credit cards, the payment card industry data security standard), data privacy (including in the u.s., the california consumer privacy act, and in the european union, the general data protection regulation 2016, with interpretations varying from state to state and country to country) and cybersecurity requirements (including protection of information and incident responses), environmental protection laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, health and safety laws, import and export requirements, intellectual property laws, labor laws (including federal and state wage and hour laws), product compliance or safety laws, supplier regulations regarding the sources of supplies or products, tax laws (including as to u.s. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), unclaimed property laws and laws, regulations and standards applicable to other commercial matters. moreover, grainger is also subject to audits and inquiries in the normal course of business.
failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations and standards could result in civil, criminal, monetary and non-monetary fines, penalties and/or, remediation costs as well as potential damage to the company's reputation. changes in these laws, regulations and standards, or in their interpretation, could increase the cost of doing business, including, among other factors, as a result of increased investments in technology and the development of new operational processes. furthermore, while grainger has implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, regulations and standards, there can be no assurance that employees, contractors, suppliers, vendors, or other third parties will not violate such laws, regulations and standards or grainger's policies. any such failure to comply or violation could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect grainger's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in addition, grainger's business and results of operations in the uk may be negatively affected by changes in trade policies, or changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws, resulting from the uk's anticipated exit from the european union.
grainger is subject to a number of rules and regulations related to its government contracts, which may result in increased compliance costs and potential liabilities.
grainger's contracts with u.s. federal, state and local government entities are subject to various regulations related to procurement, formation and performance. in addition, the company's government contracts may provide for termination, reduction or modification by the government at any time, with or without cause. from time to time, grainger is subject to governmental or regulatory investigations or audits related to its compliance with these rules and regulations. violations of these regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, the inability to participate in existing or future government contracting and other administrative sanctions. any such penalties could result in damage to the company's reputation, increased costs of compliance and/or remediation and could adversely affect the company's financial condition and results of operations.
in conducting its business grainger may become subject to legal proceedings or governmental investigations, including in connection with product liability or product compliance claims if people, property or the environment are harmed by grainger's products or services.
grainger is, and from time to time may become, party to a number of legal proceedings or governmental investigations for alleged violations of laws, rules or regulations. grainger also may be subject to disputes and proceedings incidental to its business, including product-related claims for personal injury or illness, death, or environmental or property damage, including the proceedings discussed in part i, item 3. legal proceedings. grainger also may be requested or required to recall products or take other actions. the defense of these proceedings may require significant expenses and divert management's time and attention, and grainger may be required to pay damages that could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the company's
13
reputation could also be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity. in addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that grainger may have with respect to such matters may be insufficient or unavailable to protect the company against potential loss exposures.
tax changes could affect grainger's effective tax rate and future profitability.
grainger's future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in grainger's overall profitability and changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of the examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessment of the company's tax exposures.
in december 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation that included significant changes to the taxation of business entities. the company's accounting for the tax effects of such legislation may be subject to change due to subsequent clarification or amendment of the tax law which could adversely affect the company's operating results or financial condition.
grainger's common stock may be subject to volatility or price declines.
the trading price of grainger's common stock is subject to broad and unpredictable fluctuation due to changes in economic, political and market conditions, the operating results of grainger and its competitors, changes in expectations as to grainger's future financial or operating performance, including estimates by securities analysts and investors, the company's failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements provided to the public, changes in capital structure, share repurchase programs or dividend policies, and a number of other factors, including those discussed in this item 1a. these factors, many which are outside of grainger's control, could cause stock price volatility or grainger's stock price to decline.
changes in grainger's credit ratings and outlook may reduce access to capital and increase borrowing costs.
grainger's credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including the company's financial strength and factors outside of grainger's control, such as conditions affecting grainger's industry generally or the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. grainger cannot provide assurances that its current credit ratings will remain in effect or that the ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies. if rating agencies lower, suspend or withdraw the ratings, the market price or marketability of grainger's securities may be adversely affected. in addition, any change in ratings could make it more difficult for the company to raise capital on favorable terms, impact the company's ability to obtain adequate financing, and result in higher interest costs for the company's existing credit facilities or on future financings.
grainger has incurred substantial indebtedness and may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect cash flow, decrease business flexibility, or prevent grainger from fulfilling its obligations.
as of december 31, 2019, grainger's consolidated indebtedness was approximately $2.4 billion. the company's indebtedness could, among other things, limit grainger's ability to respond to rapidly changing business and economic conditions, require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, reducing the funds available for other business purposes, and make it more difficult to satisfy the company's financial obligations as they come due during periods of adverse economic and industry conditions.
the agreements governing grainger's debt agreements and instruments contain representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and default provisions. grainger's failure to comply with these restrictions and obligations could result in a default under such agreements, which may allow grainger's creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness. any such acceleration could have a material adverse effect on grainger's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and its ability to obtain financing on favorable terms in the future.
in addition, grainger may in the future seek to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, refinancing of indebtedness, share repurchases or other general corporate purposes. grainger's ability to obtain additional financing will be dependent on, among other things, the company's financial condition, prevailing market conditions and numerous other factors beyond the company's control. such additional financing may not be available
14
on commercially reasonable terms or at all. any inability to obtain financing when needed could materially adversely affect the company's business, financial condition or results of operations.
item 7: management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general w.w. grainger, inc. (grainger or company) is a broad line, business-to-business distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (mro) products and services with operations primarily in north america, japan and europe. more than 3.5 million customers worldwide rely on grainger for products such as safety, gloves, ladders, motors and janitorial supplies, along with services such as inventory management and technical support. these customers represent a broad collection of industries (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements (financial statements)). they place orders through digital channels, over the phone and at local branches. approximately 5,000 suppliers provide grainger with about 1.6 million products stocked in grainger's distribution centers (dcs) and branches worldwide.
grainger's two reportable segments are the u.s. and canada (acklands - grainger, inc. and its subsidiaries). these reportable segments reflect the results of the company's high-touch solutions businesses in those geographies. other businesses include the endless assortment businesses, (zoro in the u.s. and monotaro in japan), and smaller international high-touch solutions businesses in europe and mexico.
outlook the company's strategic priority for 2020 is clear: relentlessly expand grainger's leadership position in the mro space by being the go-to-partner for people who build and run safe, sustainable and productive operations. to achieve this, each grainger business has a set of strategic objectives focused on top line growth through market share gain. the u.s. business is focused on growing through differentiated sales and services (e.g., direct customer relationships and onsite services), advantaged mro solutions (e.g., get customers the exact products and services they need to solve a problem quickly) and unparalleled customer service (e.g., deliver flawlessly on every customer transaction). the canada business is focused on growing volume and gaining market share after substantially completing a multi-year turnaround. the other businesses are primarily focused on profitably growing the international high-touch businesses in europe and mexico and the endless assortment businesses through product assortment expansion and innovative customer acquisition. additionally, all grainger businesses are focused on continuously improving cost structures, investing in digital marketing, technology and supply chain infrastructure to ultimately deliver long-term returns for shareholders.
results of operations the following table is included as an aid to understanding changes in grainger's consolidated statements of earnings (in millions of dollars):

2019 compared to 2018
grainger's net sales of $11,486 million for the year ended 2019 increased $265 million, or 2.5%, compared to the same period in 2018. the increase in net sales was primarily driven by volume increases in the u.s. business from market share gain and continued double-digit growth in the endless assortments businesses, partially offset by lower sales in the canada business and other businesses. see note 14 to the financial statements and refer to the segment analysis below for further details.
gross profit of $4,397 million for the year ended 2019 increased $49 million, or 1% compared with the same period in 2018. the gross profit margin of 38.3% decreased 0.5 percentage points when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily driven by the lower margin endless assortment businesses which are growing at a faster rate than the rest of the company. elsewhere, lower gross profit margins in the u.s. were offset by supply chain favorability in canada.
the tables below reconcile reported selling, general and administrative expenses (sg&a), operating earnings, net earnings attributable to w.w. grainger, inc. and diluted earnings per share, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) in the united states of america to adjusted sg&a, operating earnings, net earnings attributable to w.w. grainger, inc. and diluted earnings per share, which are all considered non-gaap measures. the company believes that these non-gaap measures provide meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding financial results and assessing prospects for future performance as they provide a better baseline for analyzing the ongoing performance of its businesses by excluding items that may not be indicative of core operating results. because non-gaap financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these measures with other companies' non-gaap measures having the same or similar names. these non-gaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported results. these non-gaap measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of operations that, when viewed with gaap results, provide a more complete understanding of the business. all tables below are in millions of dollars:

sg&a of $3,135 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 decreased $55 million, or 2% compared to $3,190 million in the same period in 2018. in the fourth quarter of 2019, grainger recorded $120 million of impairment charges related to intangible assets at the cromwell business in the u.k., which is in other businesses and in the third quarter of 2018, the company recorded $139 million of impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets for cromwell. excluding restructuring, net and impairment charges in both periods as noted in the table above, sg&a was flat to prior year on net sales growth of 2.5%.
operating earnings of $1,262 million in 2019 increased $104 million, or 9% compared to $1,158 million in the same period in 2018. excluding restructuring, net and impairment charges in both periods as noted in the table above, operating earnings increased $44 million, or 3%, driven primarily by cost take-out actions in the canadian business and improved sg&a leverage in the u.s. business.
other expense, net of $53 million for the year ended 2019, decreased $24 million, or 31% compared to the same period in 2018. the decrease in expense was primarily due to lower losses from the conclusion of the company's clean energy investments during the second half of 2018.
income taxes of $314 million for the year ended 2019 increased $56 million, or 22% compared to $258 million for the same period in 2018. grainger's effective tax rates were 26.0% and 23.9% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. the increase was primarily driven by lower tax benefit from stock-based compensation and the absence of the company's clean energy tax benefits in 2019 as the company concluded its investments in 2018.
net earnings attributable to w.w. grainger, inc. for the year ended 2019 increased $67 million, or 8% to $849 million from $782 million in the same period in 2018. excluding restructuring, net and impairment charges and income taxes from both periods as noted in the table above, net earnings increased $6 million, or 1%. the increase in net earnings primarily resulted from lower sg&a and other expense, net.
diluted earnings per share was $15.32 for the year ended 2019 and increased 12% compared to $13.73 for the same period in 2018, due to higher net earnings and lower average shares outstanding. excluding restructuring, net and impairment charges and income taxes from both periods as noted in the table above, diluted earnings per share would have been $17.29 compared to $16.70 in 2018, an increase of 4%.

gross profit margin decreased 0.4 percentage points compared to the same period in 2018 reflecting the impact of contract renegotiations and customer mix.
sg&a for the year ended 2019 was flat compared to the same period in 2018 due to strong expense management.
operating earnings of $1,391 million increased $53 million, or 4% from $1,338 million in the same period of 2018. this increase was driven primarily by higher sales, higher gross profit dollars and improved sg&a leverage.
canada net sales were $529 million for the year ended 2019, a decrease of $124 million, or 19% when compared with $653 million for 2018 and consisted of the following:
percent (decrease)/increase volume                                 (19.0)%
price                                      2.0

total                                  (19.0)%
for the year ended 2019, volume decreased by 19 percentage points compared to the same period in 2018 due to customer disruption as a result of actions taken to reduce the branch footprint and optimize sales coverage.
gross profit margin increased 0.7 percentage points in 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to inventory and supply chain efficiencies.
sg&a decreased $89 million, or 34% in 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. excluding restructuring, net in both periods as noted in the table above, sg&a would have decreased $54 million, or 24% compared to the prior period. this decrease was primarily due to cost reduction actions and lower variable expense as a result of lower sales volume.
operating earnings were $3 million for the year ended 2019 compared to losses of $49 million in the same period in 2018. excluding restructuring, net in both periods (as noted in the table above and note 5 to the financial statements), operating earnings would have been $3 million compared to operating losses of $14 million in the prior period primarily due to lower sg&a and lower sales volume.
other businesses net sales for other businesses were $2,651 million for the year ended 2019, an increase of $210 million, or 8.5%, when compared to the same period in 2018. the net sales increase was primarily due to incremental sales at the endless assortment businesses and consisted of the following:
percent increase/ (decrease)
volume                                     9.5%
foreign exchange                          (1.0)
total                                      8.5%
the net sales increase was primarily due to customer acquisition growth from the endless assortment businesses, partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds from the euro and pound sterling.
operating losses for other businesses were $9 million for the year ended 2019, a decrease of $17 million, or 216% compared to operating earnings of $8 million for 2018. other businesses included impairment charges in 2019 and 2018 relating to the cromwell business in the u.k. see note 4 and note 5 to the financial statements. excluding restructuring, net and impairment charges in both periods, operating earnings decreased $40 million, or 27%. this decrease is primarily due to the endless assortment businesses' investments to drive long-term growth and performance in the high-touch solutions businesses.

segment analysis - 2018 compared to 2017
for the full year 2017 to 2018 comparative discussion, see item 7: management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - segment analysis - 2018 compared to 2017 in grainger's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018.
financial condition for the full year 2017 discussion, see item 7: management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition in grainger's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018.
grainger believes that its current level of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under its revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs. grainger expects to continue to invest in its business and return excess cash to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, which it plans to fund through total available liquidity and cash flows generated from operations. grainger also maintains access to capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity.
cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2019 and 2018, grainger had cash and cash equivalents of $360 million and $538 million, respectively. approximately 69% and 49% were outside the u.s. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. grainger has no material limits or restrictions on its ability to use these foreign liquid assets.
cash flows
2019 compared to 2018
net cash provided by operating activities was $1,042 million and $1,057 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to employee variable compensation payments, partially offset by favorable net income and changes in working capital.
net cash used in investing activities was $202 million and $166 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. this increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by lower proceeds from the sales of assets when compared to the prior year.
net cash used in financing activities was $1,023 million and $670 million in the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by higher treasury stock repurchases in 2019 compared to 2018 and lower proceeds from stock options exercised.
working capital internally generated funds are the primary source of working capital and growth initiatives including capital expenditures. grainger's working capital is not impacted by significant seasonality trends throughout the year.
working capital consists of current assets (less non-operating cash) and current liabilities (less short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and lease liabilities). working capital was $2,092 million at december 31, 2019, compared with $1,898 million at december 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventory and decreases in accrued compensation and benefits partially offset by increases in accounts payable. at these dates, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.6 and 2.4, respectively.

purchase obligations are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs. while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and non-inventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract.
other liabilities represent future payments for profit sharing and other employee benefit plans.
the company's net obligation for postretirement healthcare benefits plan of approximately $2 million, is not included in the table above as no additional amounts are required to be funded as of december 31, 2019. the company's historical practice regarding this plan has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate.
grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of approximately $32 million for tax uncertainties and interest at december 31, 2019. this amount is excluded from the table above, as grainger cannot predict the timing of these cash payments by period. see note 13 to the financial statements.
off-balance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.
critical accounting estimates the methods, assumptions, and estimates that used in applying the company's accounting policies may require the application of judgments regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. the company considers an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) it involves assumptions that are uncertain when judgment was applied, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a significant impact on grainger's consolidated financial position and results. while the company believes that estimates, assumptions, and judgments used are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate was made. see note 1 to the financial statements for further information on the company's critical accounting estimates, which are as follows:
inventory: inventory reflected at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering future demand, market conditions and liquidation values;

goodwill and intangible assets impairment: the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; and contingencies: the estimation of when a contingent loss is probable and reasonably estimable.
forward-looking statements from time to time, in this annual report on form 10-k, as well as in other written reports, communications and verbal statements, grainger makes forward-looking statements that are not historical in nature but concern forecasts of future results, business plans, analyses, prospects, strategies, objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be "forward-looking statements" under the federal securities laws. forward-looking statements can generally be identified by their use of terms such as "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "expect," "could," "forecast," "may," "intend," "plan," "predict," "project," "will" or "would" and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions.
grainger cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized and achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company's control, which could cause grainger's results to differ materially from those that are presented.
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation: higher product costs or other expenses; a major loss of customers; loss or disruption of sources of supply; increased competitive pricing pressures; failure to develop or implement new technology initiatives or business strategies; failure to adequately protect intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims; fluctuations or declines in the company's gross profit percentage; the company's responses to market pressures; the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings, including with respect to wage and hour, anti-bribery and corruption, environmental, advertising, product liability, safety or compliance, or privacy and cybersecurity matters; investigations, inquiries, audits and changes in laws and regulations; failure to comply with laws, regulations and standards; government contract matters; disruption of information technology or data security systems involving us or third parties on which we depend; general industry, economic, market or political conditions; general global economic conditions including tariffs and trade issues and policies; currency exchange rate fluctuations; market volatility, including volatility or price declines of the company's common stock; commodity price volatility; labor shortages; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services; pandemic diseases or viral contagions; natural and other catastrophes; unanticipated and/or extreme weather conditions; loss of key members of management; the company's ability to operate, integrate and leverage acquired businesses; changes in effective tax rates; changes in credit ratings or outlook; the company's incurrence of indebtedness and other factors identified under item 1a: risk factors and elsewhere in this form 10-k.
caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on grainger's forward-looking statements and grainger undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

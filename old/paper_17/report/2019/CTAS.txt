item 1a.  risk factors the statements in this section describe the most significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operation and the trading price of our debt or equity securities.
in addition, this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements. the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as "estimates," "anticipates," "predicts," "projects," "plans," "expects," "intends," "target," "forecast," "believes," "seeks," "could," "should," "may" and "will" or the negative versions thereof and similar words, terms and expressions and by the context in which they are used. such statements are based upon current expectations of cintas and speak only as of the date made. you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized. these statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties, potentially inaccurate assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this annual report. factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, risks inherent with the g&k transaction in the achievement of cost synergies and the timing thereof, including whether the transaction will be accretive and within the expected timeframe and the actual amounts of future integration expenses; the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs including energy and fuel costs; lower sales volumes; loss of customers due to outsourcing trends; the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions, including g&k; fluctuations in costs of materials and labor including increased medical costs; costs and possible effects of union organizing activities; failure to comply with government regulations concerning employment discrimination, employee pay and benefits and employee health and safety; the effect on operations of exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs and other political, economic and regulatory risks; uncertainties regarding any existing or newly-discovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation; the cost, results and ongoing assessment of internal controls for financial reporting required by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002; the effect of new accounting pronouncements; costs of our sap system implementation; disruptions caused by the inaccessibility of computer systems data, including cybersecurity risks; the initiation or outcome of litigation, investigations or other proceedings; higher assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products; the disruption of operations from catastrophic or extraordinary events; the amount and timing of repurchases of our common stock, if any; changes in federal and state tax and labor laws; and the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service. cintas undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forward-looking statements or to otherwise update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or to reflect events, circumstances or any other unanticipated developments arising after the date on which such statements are made, except otherwise as required by law. the risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones we may face. additional risks and uncertainties presently not known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also harm our business.
negative global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance.
negative economic conditions, in north america and our other markets, may adversely affect our financial performance. higher levels of unemployment, inflation, tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas' products and services. increases in labor costs, including the cost to provide employee-partner related healthcare benefits, minimum wages, labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor, regulations regarding the classification of employees and/or their eligibility for overtime wages, higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles, the inability to obtain insurance coverage at cost-effective rates, higher interest rates, inflation, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental uniforms and facility services, cost of other services and selling and administrative expenses. as a result, these factors could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations.
increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance.
we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national, regional and local providers. product, design, price, quality, service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries. if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices, cintas may be required to lower prices, which would hurt its results of operations. cintas' competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates, which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates. in addition, our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services in-house instead of outsourcing these services to us. these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations.
5
an inability to open new, cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts.
we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets. the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion. our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations, negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms, identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations, zoning laws and other similar factors. any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts, and, consequently, adversely affect our financial performance.
risks associated with our acquisition practice could adversely affect our results of operations.
historically, a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions. we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions. in addition, the success of any acquisition, including the ability to realize anticipated cost synergies, depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company. the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, we may not be able to realize anticipated cost synergies resulting from acquisitions and our business could suffer. although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will discover or adequately protect against all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator. the failure to identify suitable acquisitions and successfully integrate these acquired businesses, or to discover liabilities associated with such businesses in the diligence process, could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
our indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business.
our outstanding indebtedness may have negative consequences on our business, such as requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend increases, stock buybacks and other general corporate purposes, as well as increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions. in addition, it may limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business or industry or place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt.
changes in the fuel and energy industry could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
the price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for fuel and other energy related products, actions by energy producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns, limits on refining capacities, natural disasters and environmental concerns. increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
failure to preserve positive labor relationships with our employees could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
while we believe that our employee relations are good, we have been and could continue to be the target of a unionization campaign by several unions. these unions have attempted to pressure cintas into surrendering its employees' rights to a government-supervised election by unilaterally accepting union representation. we will continue to vigorously oppose any unionization campaign and defend our employees' rights to a government-supervised election. unionization campaigns could be materially disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our results of operations.
the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. we require all our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct. our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states. political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial stability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our supplier standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, inflation and other
6
factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. in addition, u.s. and foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we earn revenue, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the u.s. dollar, including the canadian dollar, british pound, and the euro. in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, revenue denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar represented less than 10% of our consolidated revenue. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate revenue, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. therefore, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies, particularly in the event of significant increases in foreign currency revenue, will impact our revenue and operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. this impact could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
failure to comply with federal and state regulations to which we are subject could result in penalties or costs that could adversely affect our results of operations.
our business is subject to complex and stringent state and federal regulations, including employment laws and regulations, minimum wage requirements, overtime requirements, working condition requirements, citizenship requirements, transportation and other laws and regulations. in particular, we are subject to the regulations promulgated by the u.s. department of transportation, or usdot, and under the occupational safety and health act of 1970, as amended, or osha. we have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with the usdot, osha and other laws and regulations to which we are subject. changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations, including any laws or regulations that may be enacted by the current u.s. presidential administration and congress, may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business. the impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted. compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures. any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines by government authorities, payment of damages to private litigants, or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could adversely affect our ability to service customers and our consolidated results of operations.
we are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to various litigation claims and legal proceeding arising from the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability and expense material to our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations.
our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations. we could incur significant costs, including clean-up costs, fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations. we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations, including those acquired in the g&k acquisition. while based on information currently known to us, we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters, our liability could exceed forecasted amounts, and the imposition of additional clean-up obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant additional costs which could adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
under applicable environmental laws, an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property, whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials. while we regularly engage in environmental due
7
diligence in connection with acquisitions, we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to third-party actions, including tort suits.
we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information and manage our businesses. disruptions in the availability of computer systems due to implementation of a new system or otherwise, or privacy breaches involving computer systems, could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales, results of operations and reputation and expose us to litigation risk.
our businesses rely on our computer systems to provide customer information, process customer transactions and provide other general information necessary to manage our businesses. we have an active disaster recovery plan in place that is frequently reviewed and tested. however, our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption due to system conversions, such as our current conversion to sap enterprise system, power outages, computer or telecommunication failures, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees. although we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related and other potential disruptions, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays and interruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers. any disruption caused by the unavailability of our computer systems could adversely affect our sales, could require us to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and, therefore, could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. in addition, cyber-security attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. if the network of security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems to address these threats to our technology fails, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected company, customer, or employee information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, or other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks could result in financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability and damage to our reputation.
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price.
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation. while we continue to evaluate our internal controls, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud. this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.
we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions.
we believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture, which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization. this factor, along with our entire operation, depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees. competitive pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees which could adversely affect our businesses.
unexpected events could negatively impact our operations and adversely affect our results of operations.
unexpected events, including fires or explosions at facilities, severe weather conditions, natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned outages, supply disruptions, failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws and/or regulations impacting our businesses, could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. these events could result in customer disruption, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems. in addition, negative publicity, whether warranted or not, impacting brand image perception could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
8
we may recognize impairment charges, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our long-lived assets for impairment when required by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap). these accounting principles require that we record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their estimated fair values. the estimated fair value of these assets is impacted by general economic conditions in the locations in which we operate. deterioration in these general economic conditions may result in: declining revenue, which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow; reductions in management's estimates for future revenue and operating cash flow growth; increases in borrowing rates and other deterioration in factors that impact our weighted average cost of capital; and deteriorating real estate values. if our assessment of goodwill, other intangible assets or long-lived assets indicates an impairment of the carrying value for which we recognize an impairment charge, this may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
the effects of credit market volatility and changes in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.
our operating cash flows, combined with access to the credit markets, provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity. however, deterioration in the global credit markets may limit our ability to access credit markets, which could adversely affect our liquidity and/or increase our cost of borrowing. in addition, credit market deterioration and its actual or perceived effects on our results of operations and financial condition, along with deterioration in general economic conditions, may increase the likelihood that the major independent credit agencies will downgrade our credit ratings, which could increase our cost of borrowing. increases in our cost of borrowing could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could adversely impact our financial results.
changes in tax laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, or other tax law implementations or interpretations, could increase our effective tax rate, restrict our ability to repatriate undistributed offshore earnings, or impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows.
we are also subject to tax audits, including with respect to transfer pricing, in the united states and other jurisdictions and our tax positions may be challenged by tax authorities. although we believe that our current tax provisions are reasonable and appropriate, there can be no assurance that these items will be settled for the amounts accrued, that additional tax exposures will not be identified in the future or that additional tax reserves will not be necessary for any such exposures. any increase in the amount of taxation incurred as a result of challenges to our tax filing positions could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business strategy cintas helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes, primarily in north america, as well as latin america, europe and asia, get readytm to open their doors with confidence every day by providing a wide range of products and services that enhance our customers' image and help keep their facilities and employees clean, safe and looking their best. with products and services including uniforms, floor care, restroom supplies, first aid and safety products, fire extinguishers and testing and safety and compliance training, cintas helps customers get ready for the workdaytm.
we are north america's leading provider of corporate identity uniforms through rental and sales programs, as well as a significant provider of related business services, including entrance mats, restroom cleaning services and supplies, carpet and tile cleaning services, first aid and safety services and fire protection products and services.
cintas' principal objective is "to exceed customers' expectations in order to maximize the long-term value of cintas for shareholders and working partners," and it provides the framework and focus for cintas' business strategy. this strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all our products and services by increasing our penetration at existing customers and by broadening our customer base to include business segments to which we have not historically served. we will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities for our current and future customers.
to pursue the strategy of increasing penetration, we have a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals visiting our customers on a regular basis. this frequent contact with our customers enables us to develop close personal relationships. the combination of our distribution system and these strong customer relationships provides a platform from which we launch additional products and services.
we pursue the strategy of broadening our customer base in several ways. cintas has a national sales organization introducing all our products and services to prospects in all business segments. our broad range of products and services allows our sales organization to consider any type of business a prospect. we also broaden our customer base through geographic expansion, especially in our first aid and safety and fire protection businesses. finally, we evaluate strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise.
results of operations cintas classifies its business into two reportable operating segments and places the remainder of its operating segments in an all other category. cintas' two reportable operating segments are uniform rental and facility services and first aid and safety services. the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment, consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels and other ancillary items. in addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies, carpet and tile cleaning services and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment. the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment consists of first aid and safety products and services. the remainder of cintas' business, which consists of fire protection services and its uniform direct sale business, is included in all other. these operating segments consist of fire protection products and services and the direct sale of uniforms and related items. cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes. revenue and income before income taxes for each of these reportable operating segments for the years ended may 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are presented in note 15 entitled operating segment information of "notes to consolidated financial statements." the company regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance and makes changes when appropriate.
on march 21, 2017, cintas completed the acquisition of g&k services, inc. (g&k). g&k is a wholly-owned subsidiary of cintas that operates within the uniform rental and facility services operating segment. in fiscal 2018, cintas sold a significant business referred to as "discontinued services." prior to the sale of discontinued services, the operations were primarily included in all other and classified as held for sale. in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets and discontinued operations, the results of discontinued services have been excluded from both continuing operations and operating segment results for all periods presented. see note 17 entitled discontinued operations of "notes to consolidated financial statements" for additional information.

in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)," to clarify revenue recognition principles. this guidance is intended to improve disclosure requirements and enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices. cintas adopted this asu, and all the related amendments, effective june 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. see note 1 entitled significant accounting policies and note 2 entitled revenue recognition of "notes to consolidated financial statements" for more information.
the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percent of revenue by reportable operating segment, all other and in total for the fiscal years ended may 31:

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018
fiscal 2019 total revenue was $6.9 billion, an increase of 6.4% over the prior fiscal year. revenue increased organically by 6.5% as a result of increased sales volume. organic growth adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. total revenue was positively impacted by 0.2% due to acquisitions and negatively impacted by 0.3% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
organic growth by quarter for fiscal 2019 is as follows:
organic growth first quarter ended august 31, 2018                5.2%
second quarter ended november 30, 2018             7.0%
third quarter ended february 28, 2019              6.0%
fourth quarter ended may 31, 2019                  7.6%
for the fiscal year ended may 31, 2019             6.5%
uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments, including flame resistant clothing, and the rental and/or sale of mats, mops, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental services. revenue from the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment increased 5.8% compared to fiscal 2018 due to an organic growth increase of 6.1%. revenue growth was negatively impacted by 0.3% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. revenue growth was a result of new business, the penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and price increases, partially offset by lost business. new business growth resulted from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives. generally, sales productivity improvements are due to increased tenure and improved training, which produce a higher number of products and services sold.
other revenue, consisting of revenue from the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and all other, increased 9.0% compared to fiscal 2018. revenue increased organically by 7.8% primarily due to improved sales representative productivity. revenue growth was positively impacted by 1.2% due to acquisitions.
cost of uniform rental and facility services increased 4.9% compared to fiscal 2018. cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items. the cost of uniform rental and facility services increase compared to fiscal 2018 was due to increased uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment sales volume from organic growth.
cost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly first aid and safety products, uniforms and fire protection products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and all other. cost of other increased 8.1% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. the increase was primarily related to the increased sales volumes in the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and all other.
selling and administrative expenses increased $63.9 million, or 3.3%, compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increases in labor and other employee-partner related expenses.

cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements. these covenants limit cintas' ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of cintas' assets. these covenants also require cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) and interest coverage ratios. cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. if a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented.
our access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity.  we do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past. our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend, to a significant degree, on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness. as of may 31, 2019, our ratings were as follows:

in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding long-term debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason, or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long-term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above, particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings, our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected. in addition, in such a case, our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long-term debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above. the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.
to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. one such factor is the ratio of our total debt to ebitda. for the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year, obligations under capital leases due in one year, long-term debt, long-term obligations under capital leases and standby letters of credit.

(1)   see note 7 entitled debt and derivatives of "notes to consolidated financial statements" for a detailed presentation of cintas' debt.
(2)   operating leases consist primarily of operational facility leases and vehicle leases.
(3)   interest payments could include interest on both fixed and variable rate debt. as of may 31, 2019, cintas had approximately $312.5 million of variable rate debt outstanding, which consisted of $112.5 million of commercial paper and a $200.0 million term loan. the interest payments for variable rate debt were estimated using forecasted rates in future years.
cintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans and may make payments to defined benefit plans to satisfy minimum funding requirements. the amount of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are at the discretion of the board of directors of cintas. future contributions to the defined contribution plans are expected to be $73.6 million in the next year, $158.4 million in the next two to three years and $174.7 million in the next four to five years. future contributions to the defined benefit plans are expected to be $3.1 million in the next year, $6.1 million in the next two to three years and $6.1 million in the next four to five years.

inflation and changing prices changes in wages, benefits and energy costs have the potential to materially impact cintas' consolidated financial results. management believes inflation has not had a material impact on cintas' consolidated financial condition or a negative impact on consolidated results of operations.
litigation and other contingencies cintas is subject to legal proceedings, insurance receipts, legal settlements and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. in the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows of cintas.
new accounting standards in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)," to clarify revenue recognition principles. this guidance is intended to improve disclosure requirements and enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices. improved disclosures under the amended guidance relate to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized from contracts with customers. we adopted asu 2014-09, and all the related amendments, effective june 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. asu 2014-09 requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. upon adoption of asu 2014-09, we recorded an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of june 1, 2018. the adjustment to retained earnings primarily relates to the capitalization of certain direct and incremental contract costs required by the new guidance. capitalized costs are amortized ratably over the anticipated period of benefit. we applied asu 2014-09 only to contracts that were not completed prior to fiscal 2019. results for reporting periods beginning after may 31, 2018 are presented under asu 2014-09, while comparative prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be presented under accounting standards in effect in those periods.
there were two implementation adjustments upon adoption of asu 2014-09: (1) capitalization of certain direct and incremental contract costs and (2) the timing of revenue recognition for certain contracts with customers that create an asset with no alternative use to the company and an enforceable right of payment from the customer upon termination. adoption of asu 2014-09 impacted the company's previously reported results as of may 31, 2018 as follows:
capitalization of contract costs. the company has elected to apply the guidance, as a practical expedient, to a portfolio of contracts (or performance obligations) with similar characteristics because the company reasonably expects that the effects on the consolidated financial statements of applying this guidance to the portfolio would not differ materially from applying this guidance to the individual contracts within the portfolio. the company also continues to expense certain costs to obtain a contract if those costs do not meet the criteria of the new standard or the amortization period of the asset would have been one year or less.
24
assets with no alternative use. for our uniform direct sale business, our revenue, prior to the adoption of asu 2014-09, was primarily generated from the sale of finished products to customers as products are shipped and title passes to the customers. for certain contracts with customers, the company creates an asset with no alternative use to the company, and the company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. for these contracts, we have moved from a point-in-time model to an over-time model in which our measure of progress is finished goods with no alternative use in accordance with the provisions of asu 2014-09. we expect asu 2014-09 will have no cash impact and will not affect the economics of our underlying customer contracts.

in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, "leases (topic 842)," as amended. the new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. this classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. a lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. topic 842 provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition, and we have determined to use certain of these practical expedients. the company plans to elect the package of practical expedients permitted under topic 842, which allows a lessee to carryforward their population of existing leases, the classification of each lease, as well as the treatment of initial direct costs as of the period of adoption. the company also plans to elect the practical expedient related to lease and non-lease components, as an accounting policy election for all asset classes, which allows a lessee to not separate non-lease from lease components and instead account for consideration paid in a contract as a single lease component. in addition, the company plans to elect the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases with a term of 12 months or less, which means it will not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for these leases. the company does not expect to elect the use-of-hindsight practical expedient. this guidance will be adopted by the company on june 1, 2019. in accordance with topic 842, a registrant can elect not to present comparative financial information under topic 842 if it recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption. the company intends to make this transition election. the company has implemented a new lease system in connection with the adoption of topic 842. the majority of our lease spend relates to certain real estate with the remaining lease spend primarily related to vehicles and equipment. based on the company's portfolio of leases at may 31, 2019, approximately $160.0 million to $185.0 million of lease assets and liabilities will be recognized on the balance sheet upon adoption. we do not expect a material impact on the consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows. the company is substantially complete with its implementation efforts.
in august 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-15, "classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments." asu 2016-15 makes eight targeted changes to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. asu 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. the company's adoption of this standard on june 1, 2018 did not have a material impact on its consolidated statements of cash flows.

in january 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-04, "simplifying the test for goodwill impairment." asu 2017-04 eliminates the two-step process that required identification of potential impairment and a separate measure of the actual impairment. goodwill impairment charges, if any, would be determined by the difference between a reporting unit's carrying value and its fair value (impairment loss is limited to the carrying value). this standard is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests beginning after december 15, 2019. the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
in march 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-07, "improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit costs." asu 2017-07 continues to require the service component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs to be presented in the same line item as other employee compensation costs on the consolidated statement of income and changes the presentation of other components of net benefit cost so that these items will be presented outside of operating income within the consolidated statements of income. cintas retrospectively adopted asu 2017-07 on june 1, 2017. the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
in august 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-12, "targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities." asu 2017-12 better aligns an entity's risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. among other amendments, the update allows entities to designate the variability in cash flows attributable to changes in a contractually specified component stated in the contract as the hedged risk in a cash flow hedge of a forecasted purchase or sale of a nonfinancial asset. this standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2018. we adopted the standard effective as of june 1, 2018, and the effect of adoption of this standard did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.
in february 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-02, "income statement - reporting comprehensive income (topic 220): reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income." asu 2018-02 allows entities to elect to reclassify the income tax effects of the tax act on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings and requires additional related disclosures. this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. cintas is currently evaluating the impact that asu 2018-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements.
in april 2019, the fasb issued asu 2016-13, "financial instruments-credit losses (topic 326): measurement of credit losses on financial instruments." asu 2016-13 will replace the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. in connection with recognizing credit losses on receivables and other financial instruments, cintas will be required to use a forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model. this standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. the adoption of this standard will be through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. cintas is currently evaluating the impact that asu 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements.
no other new accounting pronouncement recently issued or newly effective had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of cintas' consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note 1 entitled significant accounting policies of "notes to consolidated financial statements." significant changes, estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition rental revenue, which is recorded in the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment, is recognized when services are performed. other revenue, which is recorded in the first aid and safety services reportable operating segments and all other, is recognized when either services are performed or the obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. see note 2 entitled revenue recognition of the "notes to consolidated financial statements" for more information on cintas' revenue.
uniforms and other rental items in service uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization, calculated using the straight-line method. uniforms in service (other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing) are amortized over their useful life of 18 months. other rental items, including shop towels, mats, mops, cleanroom garments, flame resistant clothing, linens and restroom dispensers, are amortized over their useful lives, which range from 8 to 60 months. the amortization rates used are based on industry experience, cintas' specific experience and wear tests performed by cintas. these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory and related cost of uniforms and ancillary products that are presented in the consolidated financial statements.
property and equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets based on industry and cintas specific experience, which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings, 5 to 20 years for building improvements, 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements. when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets. if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets, as appropriate. cintas did not identify any indicators of impairment for the fiscal years ended may 31, 2019 and 2018.
goodwill goodwill, obtained through acquisitions of businesses, is valued at cost less any impairment. cintas completes an annual impairment test, that includes an assessment of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. cintas has identified four reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment: uniform rental and facility services, first aid and safety services and two reporting units within all other. based on the results of the annual impairment tests, cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended may 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017. cintas will continue to perform impairment tests as of march 1 in future years and when indicators of impairment exist.
service contracts and other assets service contracts and other assets, which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses, are amortized by use of the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the agreements, which are generally 5 to 10 years. the g&k service contract asset is being amortized over a period of 15 years, which represents the estimated life of the economic benefit and the asset amortization is based on the annual economic value of the underlying asset, which generally decreases over the 15-year term. certain noncompete agreements, as well as all service contracts, require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model. the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates, among other factors. because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets, actual results over time could vary from original estimates. impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification. no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the fiscal years ended may 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017.

business combinations accounting for acquisitions requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income.
general insurance liabilities general insurance liabilities represent the estimated ultimate cost of all asserted and unasserted claims incurred, primarily related to worker's compensation, auto liability and other general liability exposure through the consolidated balance sheet dates. our reserves are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for specific expectations based on our claims history. cintas records an increase or decrease in selling and administrative expenses related to development of prior claims, higher claims activity and other environmental factors in the period in which it becomes known. these changes in estimates may be material to the consolidated financial statements.
stock-based compensation compensation expense is recognized for all share-based payments to employees, including stock options and restricted stock awards, in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the black-scholes option-pricing model. generally, measured compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the related share-based compensation award. see note 13 entitled stock-based compensation of "notes to consolidated financial statements" for further information.
litigation and other contingencies cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. u.s. gaap requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities, cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. see note 9 entitled income taxes of "notes to consolidated financial statements" for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities. deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes. cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets, as adjusted for valuation allowances, will be realized.
accounting for uncertain tax positions requires the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. companies may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate. based on cintas' evaluation of current tax positions, cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate.

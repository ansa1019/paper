item 1a.  risk factors the following discussion of "risk factors" identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. this information should be read in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report. the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the most significant factors to consider when evaluating our business. these factors could cause our future results to differ from our expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements identified within "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," and from historical trends.
industry and general economic risks our industry is characterized by low margins, and periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation affect our product costs and may negatively impact our profitability.
the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins. volatile food costs have a direct impact on our industry. periods of significant product cost inflation may adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers in a timely manner. in addition, periods of rapidly increasing inflation may adversely affect our business due to the impact of such inflation on discretionary spending by consumers and our limited ability to increase prices in the current, highly competitive environment. conversely, our business may be adversely affected by periods of product cost deflation, because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage margin. as a result, our results of operations may be adversely affected during periods of product cost deflation, even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant.
unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in north america and europe, as well as unfavorable conditions in particular local markets, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
the foodservice industry is characterized by relatively low profit margins with modest demand growth expected in the near-term, and, consequently, our results of operations are susceptible to regional, national and international economic trends and uncertainties. economic conditions can affect us in the following ways:
•   unfavorable conditions can depress sales and/or gross margins in a given market.
•   food cost and fuel cost inflation experienced by the consumer can lead to reductions in the frequency of dining out and the amount spent by consumers for food-away-from-home purchases, which could negatively impact our business by reducing demand for our products.
•   heightened uncertainty in the financial markets negatively affects consumer confidence and discretionary spending, which can cause disruptions with our customers and suppliers.
•   liquidity issues and the inability of our customers to consistently access credit markets to obtain cash to support their operations can cause temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions involving the collection of funds from such customers.
•   liquidity issues and the inability of our suppliers to consistently access credit markets to obtain cash to support their operations can cause temporary interruptions in our ability to obtain the foodservice products and supplies that we need in the quantities and at the prices that we request.
historically, north america and europe have experienced, from time to time, deteriorating economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in their financial markets, which have adversely impacted business and consumer confidence and spending and depressed capital investment and economic activity in the affected regions. if similar unfavorable economic conditions were to arise in the future, or recent volatility in the financial markets and the global economy were to continue, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations in international markets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
our international operations subject us to certain risks, including economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations in international markets in which we operate. for example, the u.k.'s anticipated exit from the eu (commonly referred to as "brexit") and the resulting significant change to the u.k.'s relationship with the eu and with countries outside the eu (and the laws, regulations and trade deals impacting business conducted between them) could disrupt the overall economic growth or stability of the u.k. and the eu and otherwise negatively impact our european operations.
the u.k. is currently negotiating the terms of brexit, with the u.k. currently due to exit the eu on or before october 31, 2019. in november 2018, the u.k. and the eu agreed upon a draft withdrawal agreement that set out the terms governing the u.k.'s departure, including, among other things, a transition period to allow for a future trade deal to be agreed upon. after the u.k. parliament rejected the draft withdrawal agreement multiple times during the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the eu agreed to an extension of the exit date to october 31, 2019. as a result, there is significant uncertainty about the terms and timing under which the u.k. will leave the eu. it is possible that brexit will result in our u.k. and eu operations becoming subject to materially different, and potentially conflicting, laws, regulations or tariffs which could require costly new compliance initiatives or changes to legal entity structures or operating practices. furthermore, if the u.k. were to leave the eu without an agreement (a "hard brexit"), there may be additional adverse impacts on immigration and trade between the u.k. and the eu or countries outside the eu. such impacts may directly increase our costs or could decrease demand for our goods and services by adversely impacting the business of restaurants or other customers in the foodservice distribution industry.
the completion of brexit could also adversely affect the value of our euro- and pound-denominated assets and obligations. exchange rates related to the british pound sterling have been more volatile since the u.k. announced it would exit the eu and such volatility may continue in the future. future fluctuations in the exchange rate between the british pound sterling and the local currencies of our suppliers may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the u.k., which increases we may not be able to pass on to our customers. uncertainty surrounding brexit has contributed to recent fluctuations in the u.k. economy, which contracted in the second quarter of 2019 and could experience future disruptions. in addition, brexit could cause financial and capital markets within and outside the u.k. or the eu to constrict, thereby negatively impacting our ability to finance our business, and could cause a substantial dip in consumer confidence and spending that could negatively impact the foodservice distribution industry. any one of these impacts could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
additionally, the "yellow vest" protests in france against a fuel tax increase and the french government have negatively impacted our sales in france and may continue to do so. similarly, future labor disruptions or disputes could disrupt the integration of brake france and davigel into sysco france and our operations in france and the eu generally. in addition, if changes occur in laws and regulations impacting the flow of goods, services and workers in either the u.k or france or in other parts of the eu, with respect to brexit or otherwise, our european operations could also be negatively impacted.
competition and the impact of gpos may reduce our margins and make it difficult for us to maintain our market share, growth rate and profitability.
the foodservice distribution industry is fragmented and highly competitive, with local, regional and multi-regional distributors and specialty competitors. local and regional companies often align themselves with other smaller distributors through purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups, with the goal of enhancing their geographic reach, private label offerings, overall purchasing power, cost efficiencies and ability to meet customer distribution requirements. these suppliers may also rely on local presence as a source of competitive advantage, and they may have lower costs and other competitive advantages due to geographic proximity. furthermore, barriers to entry by new competitors, or geographic or product line expansion by existing competitors, are low. additionally, increased competition from non-traditional sources (such as club stores and commercial wholesale outlets with lower cost structures), online direct food wholesalers and cash and carry operations have served to further increase pressure on the industry's profit margins, and continued margin pressure within the industry may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
moreover, some of our customers purchase their products from us through group purchasing organizations, or "gpos," in an effort to lower the prices paid by these customers on their foodservice orders. gpos have a relatively larger presence in the healthcare, lodging and foodservice management customer segments. if these gpos are able to add a significant number of our customers as members, it may negatively affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
finally, demand for food-away-from-home products is volatile and price sensitive, imposing limits on our customers' ability to absorb cost increases. new and increasing competitive sources may result in increased focus on pricing and on limiting price increases, or may require increased discounting or other concessions. such competition or other industry pressures may result in margin erosion and/or make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers.
if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. in addition, even if we are able to effectively differentiate ourselves, we may only be able to do so through increased expenditures or decreased prices, which could also adversely impact our results of operations.
we may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs, and fuel hedging arrangements intended to contain fuel costs could result in above market fuel costs.
volatile fuel prices have a direct impact on our industry. we require significant quantities of fuel for our delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with fluctuations in the market price for fuel. the price and supply of fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our control, such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries, or opec, and other oil and gas producers, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns. the cost of fuel affects the price paid by us for products, as well as the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers. although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel costs to our customers in the past through, among other things, our fuel surcharge program, there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future. if fuel costs increase in the future, we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
we routinely enter into fuel hedging arrangements, including fuel derivatives, to hedge our exposure to volatile fuel prices. nevertheless, our fuel hedging transactions may not be effective in protecting us from changes in fuel prices, and if fuel prices were to decrease significantly, these hedging arrangements would result in our paying higher-than-market costs for a portion of our diesel fuel. in addition, our future use of fuel derivatives would expose us to the risk that any of our counterparties fails to perform its obligations, whether due to its insolvency or otherwise, which could result in financial losses.
business and operational risks conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies and increase our product costs.
we obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from third-party suppliers. although our purchasing volume can provide benefits when dealing with suppliers, suppliers may not be able to provide the foodservice products and supplies that we need in the quantities and at the prices that we request. we are also subject to delays caused by interruptions in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control. these conditions include shortages of qualified labor for our suppliers, work slowdowns, work interruptions, strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers, short-term weather conditions or more prolonged climate change, crop and other agricultural conditions, water shortages, animal disease outbreaks, transportation interruptions, unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs, product recalls, competitive demands, terrorist attacks or international hostilities and natural disasters or other catastrophic events (including, but not limited to, food-borne illnesses). further, increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or adversely affect demand for our products. at any time, input costs could increase for a prolonged period for a large portion of the products that we sell. additionally, we procure products from suppliers outside of the u.s., and we are subject to the risks associated with political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade, any or all of which could delay our receipt of products or increase our input costs. our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers, and customers may turn to other distributors.
in addition, as a foodservice distributor, it is necessary for us to maintain an inventory of products. declines in product pricing levels between the time we purchase a product from our suppliers and the time we sell the product to our customers could reduce our margin on that inventory, adversely affecting our results of operations.
adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings.
maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute is critical to our business. sysco's brand names, trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. anything that damages our reputation or public confidence in our products, whether or not justified, including negative publicity about the quality, safety, sustainability or integrity of our products or relating to illegal or unethical activities by our employees, suppliers or agents, could tarnish our reputation and diminish the value of our brand, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
reports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as e-coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis a, trichinosis, salmonella, listeria or swine flu) or injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or reduce public confidence in our products. if patrons of our restaurant customers were to become ill from food-borne illnesses, our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations, which would have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. in addition, instances of food-borne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns (even those unrelated to the use of sysco products) or public concern regarding the safety of our products, can result in negative publicity about the food service distribution industry and materially adversely affect our results of operations.
damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our products and services. this reduction in demand, together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation, would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand. our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity, including dissemination via print, broadcast or social media, or other forms of internet-based communications. adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and image, undermine our customers' confidence in us and reduce short-term or long-term demand for our products and services, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
our relationships with long-term customers may be materially diminished or terminated.
we have long-standing relationships with a number of our customers, many of whom could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us or materially reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time. market competition, customer requirements, customer financial condition and customer consolidation through mergers or acquisitions also could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand these relationships. we may not be able to retain or renew existing agreements, maintain relationships with any of our customers on acceptable terms, or at all, or collect amounts that insolvent customers might owe us. our customer agreements are generally terminable upon written notice by either us or the customer, which provides our customers with the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us on less favorable terms or to award more business to our competitors. the loss of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
unfavorable changes to the mix of locally managed customers versus multi-unit customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
increasing the volume of our sales to locally managed customers is very important for our business and our results of operations. gross margin from our multi-unit customers is generally lower than that of our locally managed customers because we typically sell higher volumes of products to these customers and provide a relatively lower level of value-added services than we do to locally managed customers. if sales to our locally managed customers do not grow at the same or a greater rate as sales to our multi-unit customers, our operating margins may decline.
moreover, if sales to our multi-unit customers increase at a faster pace of growth than sales to our locally managed customers, we will become more dependent on multi-unit customers as they begin to represent a greater proportion of our total sales. additionally, the loss of sales to the larger of these multi-unit customers could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. additionally, as a result of our greater dependence on these customers, we could be pressured by them to lower our prices and/or offer expanded or additional services at the same prices. in that event, if we were unable to achieve additional cost savings to offset these price reductions and/or cost increases, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. we may be unable to change our cost structure and pricing practices rapidly enough to successfully compete in such an environment.
changes in consumer eating habits could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
changes in consumer eating habits (such as a decline in consuming food away from home, a decline in portion sizes, or a shift in preferences toward restaurants that are not our customers) could reduce demand for our products. consumer eating habits could be affected by a number of factors, including changes in attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the health effects of consuming certain foods. there is a growing consumer preference for sustainable, organic and locally grown products, and a shift towards plant-based proteins and/or animal proteins derived from animals that were humanely treated and antibiotic free.
changing consumer eating habits also occur due to generational shifts. millennials, the largest demographic group in terms of spend, seek new and different, as well as more ethnic, menu options and menu innovation. if consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue sales of certain items in our product portfolio, and we may experience higher costs and/or supply shortages associated with our efforts to accommodate those changes as our suppliers adapt to the new eating preferences. changing consumer eating habits may reduce the frequency with which consumers purchase meals outside of the home. additionally, changes in consumer eating habits may result in the enactment or amendment of laws and regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products, or laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food products. compliance with these laws and regulations, as well as others regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products, may be costly and time-consuming. we may not be able to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or resulting new laws or regulations or to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits.
we may not be able to achieve our three-year financial targets by the end of fiscal year 2020.
in fiscal 2018, we set new three-year financial targets to grow operating income, accelerate earnings per share growth faster than operating income growth and improve return on invested capital. our ability to meet these financial targets depends largely on our successful execution of our business plan including various related initiatives. there are various risks related to these efforts, including the risk that these efforts may not provide the expected benefits in our anticipated time frame, if at all, and may prove costlier than expected; and the risk of adverse effects to our business, results of operations and liquidity if past and future undertakings, and the associated changes to our business, do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate. our intentions and expectations with regard to the execution of our business plan, and the timing of any related initiatives, are subject to change at any time based on management's subjective evaluation of our overall business needs. in early fiscal 2020, we lowered our fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2020 adjusted operating income growth target to approximately $600 million. see the discussion in item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - strategy and fiscal 2020 three-year financial targets." if we are unable to successfully execute our business plan, whether due to our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from our various business initiatives in the anticipated time frame or otherwise, we may be unable to achieve our three-year financial targets.
expanding into international markets and complementary lines of business presents unique challenges, and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations and complementary lines of business may not be successful.
an element of our strategy includes further expansion of operations into international markets and the establishment of international procurement organizations. our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by political, economic and social conditions beyond our control, local laws and customs, and legal and regulatory constraints, including compliance with applicable anti-corruption and currency laws and regulations, of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future. risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers, suffering possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits, maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations thereof may have an adverse effect on the financial results of our international operations.
another element of our strategy includes the possibility of expansion into businesses that are closely related or complementary to, but not currently part of, our core foodservice distribution business. our ability to successfully operate in these complementary business markets may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory constraints, including compliance with regulatory programs to which we become subject. risks inherent in branching out into such complementary markets also include the costs and difficulties of managing operations outside of our core business, which may require additional skills and competencies, as well as difficulties in identifying and gaining access to suppliers or customers in new markets.
changes in applicable tax laws or regulations and the resolution of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results.
as a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income-based taxes, in both the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. for example, the u.s. and many countries in the eu where we do business are actively considering or have recently enacted changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.
further, in the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination could change if tax laws or tax rulings were to be modified. we are also subject to non-income-based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions. although we believe that our income and non-income-based tax estimates are appropriate, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
given the unpredictability of possible further changes to the u.s. or foreign tax laws and regulations and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to predict the cumulative effect of such tax laws and regulations on our results of operations and cash flow, but such laws and regulations (and changes thereto) could adversely impact our financial results.
if the products distributed by us are alleged to have caused injury or illness, or to have failed to comply with governmental regulations, we may need to recall our products and may experience product liability claims.
we, like any other foodservice distributor, may be subject to product recalls, including voluntary recalls or withdrawals, if the products we distribute are alleged to have caused injury or illness, to have been mislabeled, misbranded, or adulterated or to otherwise have violated applicable governmental regulations. we may also choose to voluntarily recall or withdraw products that we determine do not satisfy our quality standards, whether for taste, appearance or otherwise, in order to protect our brand and reputation. any future product recall or withdrawal that results in substantial and unexpected expenditures, destruction of product inventory, damage to our reputation and/or lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we also face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by sysco is alleged to have caused injury or illness. we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. further, even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image. umbrella liability insurance that we maintain for product liability claims may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or, if available, may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities. we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products, but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited, as a practical matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers. if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, product liability relating to defective products could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
if we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations, we could become subject to lawsuits, investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business.
we are subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial, regional and local governments in the countries in which we operate with respect to many aspects of our business, such as food safety and sanitation, ethical business practices, transportation, minimum wage, overtime, wage payment, wage and hour and employment discrimination, immigration, human health and safety, and due to the services we provide in connection with governmentally funded entitlement programs. for a detailed discussion of the laws and regulations to which our business is subject, please refer to "business - government regulation" in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k.
from time to time, both federal and state governmental agencies have conducted audits of our billing practices as part of investigations of providers of services under governmental contracts, or otherwise. we also receive requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with these audits. while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, we may not be in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times; moreover, we may not be able to comply with all future laws, regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations.
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or encounter disagreements with respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulations, including those referred to above, we may be subject to investigations, criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, prohibitions on exporting, or seizures or debarments from contracting with such government. the cost of compliance or the consequences of non-compliance, including debarments, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. in addition, governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require us to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations.
we may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and we may be subject to substantial fines, penalties or third-party claims for non-compliance.
our operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial, regional and local laws, rules and regulations in the various countries in which we operate relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing:
•   the discharge of pollutants into the air, soil, and water;
•   the management and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes;
•   employee exposure to hazards in the workplace; and
•   the investigation and remediation of contamination resulting from releases of petroleum products and other regulated materials.
in the course of our operations, we operate, maintain and fuel fleet vehicles; store fuel in on-site above and underground storage tanks; operate refrigeration systems; and use and dispose of hazardous substances and food wastes. we could incur substantial costs, including fines or penalties and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of any violations of environmental or workplace safety laws and regulations or releases of regulated materials into the environment. in addition, we could incur investigation, remediation or other costs related to environmental conditions at our currently or formerly owned or operated properties.
for example, most of our distribution facilities have ammonia-based refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products, which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks (including the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination associated with the use of underground storage tanks). certain of these laws and regulations in the eu may impose liability for costs of investigation or remediation of contamination (which could be material), regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal, and even if such contamination was present prior to the commencement of our operations at the site and was not caused by our activities. in addition, many of our facilities have propane and battery-powered forklifts. proposed or recently enacted legal requirements, such as those requiring the phase-out of certain ozone-depleting substances, and proposals for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, may require us to upgrade or replace equipment, or may increase our transportation or other operating costs.
we must finance and integrate acquired businesses effectively.
historically, a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions. if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner, our earnings per share may be materially adversely affected. for example, we encountered operational challenges in fiscal 2019 in connection with our efforts to integrate two businesses in france acquired in connection with the brakes group acquisition, which integration efforts have adversely affected our ability to drive growth in sales. integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise, or with a culture different from sysco's.
a significant expansion of our business and operations, in terms of geography or magnitude, could strain our administrative and operational resources. significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity, which could materially alter our debt-to-equity ratio, increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share, and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments. in addition, our failure to implement effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures with respect to a significant acquired business could result in material weaknesses and/or a failure to file our periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission on a timely basis.
we need access to borrowed funds to grow, and any default by us under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity.
a substantial part of our growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion. we anticipate additional acquisitions and capital expansion in the future. as a result, our inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability to expand. moreover, any default under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows, as well as the market value of our common stock.
our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position.
as described in note 13, "debt and other financing arrangements," in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8, as of june 29, 2019, we had approximately $8.2 billion of total indebtedness. this amount included senior notes and issuances under a commercial paper program allowing us to issue short-term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2.0 billion. we also have a revolving credit facility supporting our u.s. commercial paper program in the amount of $2.0 billion scheduled to expire on june 28, 2024, and various other smaller bank facilities.
our level of indebtedness could have important consequences for us, including:
•   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other purposes;
•   increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and
•   placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.
our indebtedness may further increase from time to time for various reasons, including fluctuations in operating results, working capital needs, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, joint ventures and/or share repurchase programs. our increased level of indebtedness and the ultimate cost of such indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity, cost of future debt financing and financial results, and our credit ratings may be adversely affected as a result of the incurrence of additional indebtedness. in the future, our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt, and any alternative financing measures available may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.
changes in the method of determining london interbank offered rate (libor), or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.
amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility may bear interest rates in relation to libor, depending on our selection of repayment options. in addition, certain of our outstanding interest rate swap agreements have a floating interest rate in relation to three-month libor. on july 27, 2017, the financial conduct authority in the u.k. announced that it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021. it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. the u.s. federal reserve is considering replacing u.s. dollar libor with a newly created index called the broad treasury financing rate, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. if libor ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate the credit facility and any interest rate swap agreements expiring after 2021 and may not be able to do so with terms that are favorable to us. the overall financing market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of libor. disruption in the financial market or the inability to renegotiate the credit facility or our interest rate swap agreements with favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.
we rely on technology in our business, and any cybersecurity incident, other technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers.
we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations, and our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology systems. we use software and other technology systems, among other things, to generate and select orders, to load and route trucks, to make purchases, to manage our warehouses and to monitor and manage our business on a day-to-day basis. we also use mobile devices, social networking and other online platforms to connect with our employees, suppliers, business partners and customers. further, our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers' and suppliers' personal information, private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and our business partners.
these technology systems and our uses thereof are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems failures, security breaches, espionage, cyber-attacks, viruses, theft and inadvertent release of information. any such disruption to these software and other technology systems, or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, the failure of these systems to otherwise perform as anticipated, or the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability, including litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies, and competitive disadvantage, any or all of which would potentially adversely affect our customer service, decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs and lower profits. moreover, a significant cybersecurity breach could require us to devote significant additional management resources to address the problems associated with the breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to protect personal information against cyber-attacks and other wrongful attempts to access such information, which could result in a disruption of our operations.
further, as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, we are also expanding and improving our information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks.
while sysco has invested, and continues to invest, in technology security initiatives and other measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, as well as disaster recovery plans, these initiatives and measures may not be entirely effective to insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on our results of operations. additionally, information technology systems continue to evolve and, in order to remain competitive, we must implement new technologies in a timely and efficient manner. if our competitors implement new technologies more quickly or successfully than we do, such competitors may be able to provide lower cost or enhanced services of superior quality compared to those we provide, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
in addition, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries where we do business. for example, the eu adopted a new regulation that became effective in may 2018, the general data protection regulation (gdpr), which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data. we are working to comply with gdpr and other laws and regulations in this area that apply to us, and we anticipate needing to devote significant additional resources to complying with these laws and regulations. our failure to successfully implement or comply with appropriate processes to adhere to the requirements of gdpr and other laws and regulations in this area could result in substantial fines or penalties and legal liability and could tarnish our reputation.
we may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans.
we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering union-represented employees. approximately 12% of our current u.s. employees are participants in such multiemployer plans. in fiscal 2019, our total contributions to these plans were approximately $48.5 million. the costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years. the amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multiemployer plans will depend upon many factors, including the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plans, government regulations, the actual return on assets held in the plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability if we choose to exit. based upon the information available to us from plan administrators, we believe that several of these multiemployer plans are underfunded. the unfunded liabilities of these plans may result in increased future payments by us and the other participating employers. underfunded multiemployer pension plans may impose a surcharge requiring additional pension contributions. our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan. we could also be treated as partially withdrawing from participation in one of these plans if the number of our employees participating in a given plan is reduced to a certain percentage over a certain period of time. such reductions in the number of employees participating in these plans could occur as a result of changes in our business operations, such as facility closures or consolidations. based on the latest information available from plan administrators, we estimate our share of the aggregate withdrawal liability on the multiemployer plans in which we participate could have been as much as $128 million as of june 29, 2019. a significant increase to funding requirements could adversely affect the company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
our funding requirements for our company-sponsored qualified pension plan may increase should financial markets experience future declines.
at the end of fiscal 2012, we decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the company-sponsored qualified pension plan (u.s. retirement plan) as of december 31, 2012 for all u.s.-based salaried and non-union hourly employees. effective january 1, 2013, these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced, defined contribution plan. while these actions will serve to limit future growth in our pension liabilities, we had a sizable pension obligation of $4.5 billion as of june 29, 2019; therefore, financial market factors could impact our funding requirements. see note 15, "company-sponsored employee benefit plans" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of the funded status of the u.s. retirement plan.
the amount of our annual contribution to the u.s. retirement plan is dependent upon, among other things, the returns on the u.s. retirement plan's assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan's liability. in fiscal 2018, we made voluntary contributions of $380 million to the u.s. retirement plan, allowing us to set an investment strategy that more closely aligns the duration of the u.s. retirement plan's assets with the duration of its liabilities. as a result, our u.s. retirement plan holds a greater amount of investments in fixed income securities, but also holds equity securities. fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase. the projected liability of the u.s. retirement plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets as these are inputs in determining our minimum funding requirements. specifically, decreases in these interest rates may have an adverse effect on our funding obligations. to the extent financial markets experience significant future declines, and/or interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets decline, our required contributions may increase for future years as our funded status decreases, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages.
as of june 29, 2019, we had approximately 69,000 employees, approximately 22% of whom were represented by unions, primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters and unions in france and sweden. contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating company. approximately 32% of our union employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements have or will have expired contracts during fiscal 2020, which contracts are subject to renegotiation. failure of our operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages. although our operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date, and we believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions, a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us.
a shortage of qualified labor could negatively affect our business and materially reduce earnings.
the future success of our operations, including the achievement of our strategic objectives, depends on our ability, and the ability of third parties on which we rely to supply and to deliver our products, to identify, recruit, develop and retain qualified and talented individuals, and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly adversely affect our business. employee recruitment, development and retention efforts undertaken by us and/or such third-parties may not be successful, resulting in a shortage of qualified individuals in future periods. any such shortage could decrease our ability to effectively serve our customers and achieve our strategic objectives. such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees (or higher costs to purchase the services of such third parties) and a corresponding reduction in our results of operations.
our authorized preferred stock provides anti-takeover benefits that may not be viewed as beneficial to stockholders.
under our restated certificate of incorporation, sysco's board of directors is authorized to issue up to 1,500,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval. issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors, depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued. in addition, if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco, the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval, which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer. as a result, hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco, which could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders, could be deterred.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our discussion below of our results includes certain non-gaap financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. other than free cash flow, any non-gaap financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures and are impacted by restructuring and transformational project costs consisting of: (1) expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives; (2) severance and facility closure charges; and (3) restructuring charges. our results of operations for fiscal 2019 and 2018 are also impacted by the following acquisition-related items: (1) intangible amortization expense and (2) integration costs. fiscal 2019 results of operations were impacted by a gain on the sale of iowa premium, llc (iowa premium) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. in addition, fiscal 2018 results of operations were impacted by multiemployer pension plan (mepp) withdrawal charges and debt extinguishment charges. sysco's results of operations for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were also impacted by the changes to the united states (u.s.) tax code resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (tax act) enacted on december 22, 2017. the impact for fiscal 2019 and 2018 includes a transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and the impact for fiscal 2019 also includes the recognition of a foreign tax credit applicable to repatriated earnings. additionally, the impact for fiscal 2018 includes: (1) a net benefit from remeasuring sysco's accrued income taxes, deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets due to the changes in tax rates; and (2) a benefit from contributions made to fund the u.s. retirement plan (pension plan). all acquisition-related costs in fiscal 2019 and 2018 that have been designated as certain items relate to the fiscal 2017 acquisition of cucina lux investments limited (the brakes acquisition).
the fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 items described above and excluded from our non-gaap measures are collectively referred to as "certain items." management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these certain items, provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that (1) is indicative of the performance of the company's underlying operations, (2) facilitates comparisons on a year-over-year basis, and (3) removes those items that are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated and that, as a result, are difficult to include in analysts' financial models and our investors' expectations with any degree of specificity.
the company uses these non-gaap measures when evaluating its financial results, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. these financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap measures in assessing the company's results of operations for periods presented. an analysis of any non-gaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap. as a result, in the table below, each period presented is adjusted for the impact described above. in the table below, individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add to the total presented due to rounding. adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding.
any metric within this section referred to as "adjusted" will reflect the applicable impact of certain items. more information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under "non-gaap reconciliations."
the following discussion includes a comparison of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. a discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 has been omitted from this form 10-k, but may be found in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, filed with the securities and exchange commission on august 24, 2018.
overview sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. our primary operations are located in north america and europe. the company has aggregated certain operating segments into three reportable segments. "other" financial information is attributable to our other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds.
•   u.s. foodservice operations - primarily includes u.s. broadline operations, which distribute a full line of food products, including custom-cut meat, seafood, specialty produce, specialty imports and a wide variety of non-food products;
•   international foodservice operations - includes operations in the americas and europe, which distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products. the americas primarily consists of operations in canada, bahamas, mexico, costa rica and panama, as well as our operations that distribute to international customers. our european operations primarily consist of operations in the united kingdom (u.k.), france, ireland and sweden;
•   sygma - our u.s. customized distribution subsidiary; and
•   other - primarily our hotel supply operations and sysco labs, which includes our suite of technology solutions that help support the business needs of our customers and provide support for some of our business technology needs.
we estimate that we serve about 16% of an approximately $300 billion annual foodservice market in the u.s. based on industry data obtained from technomic, inc. from time to time, technomic may revise the methodology used to calculate the size of the foodservice market and, as a result, our percentage can change not only from our sales results, but also from such revisions. we also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share.
according to industry sources, the foodservice, or food-away-from-home, market represents approximately 52% of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the u.s. as of the end of calendar year 2018. industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the u.s. experienced a real sales increase of approximately 1.2% in calendar year 2018 and 1.4% in calendar year 2017. real sales changes do not include the impact of inflation or deflation.
highlights and trends our fiscal year 2019 financial performance improved year-over-year. we continue to focus on our customers and furthering the progress of our transformative initiatives that we believe will position us well for long-term growth and create value for our shareholders in fiscal 2020 and beyond.
below is a comparison of results from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018:
•   sales:
◦   increased 2.4%, or $1.4 billion, to $60.1 billion;
•   operating income:
◦   increased 0.7%, or $16.1 million, to $2.3 billion;
◦   adjusted operating income increased 7.9%, or $199.9 million, to $2.7 billion;
•   net earnings:
◦   increased 17.0%, or $243.5 million, to $1.7 billion;
◦   adjusted net earnings increased 11.9%, or $197.0 million, to $1.9 billion;
•   basic earnings per share:
◦   increased 18.2%, or $0.50, to $3.24 from the comparable prior year amount of $2.74 per share;
•   diluted earnings per share:
◦   increased 18.3%, or $0.50, to $3.20 from the comparable prior year amount of $2.70 per share; and
◦   adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.55 in fiscal 2019, a 13.1% increase from the comparable prior year amount of $3.14 per share.
the overall macroeconomic trends continue to be positive in the u.s., and the underlying economic picture remains relatively positive, including growth in gross domestic product of 2.1% for the second quarter of calendar year 2019 and continued low unemployment, which was 3.7% in july. consumer confidence has decreased slightly, but remains solid. these factors are important macroeconomic indicators that describe the environment in which our customers are currently operating and speak to the relative health of the food-away-from-home market. restaurant industry trends reflect same store sales that were relatively flat in june, while customer traffic continues to be negative. the economic outlook in the international geographies in which we operate is mostly positive; however, the u.k. is experiencing low consumer confidence due to the uncertain outcome of brexit.
our sales and gross profit performance can be influenced by multiple factors, including price, volume and product mix. the modest level of growth in the foodservice market has created additional competitive pricing pressures, which can adversely affect our profitability. the majority of our sales are to locally managed customers and national customers. our locally managed customers, including independent restaurant customers, represent a greater percentage of our profitability as compared to national customers. case growth with our locally managed broadline business is important to drive gross profit dollar growth. we are maintaining our focus on growing our digital platform to continue the growth with our local customers. our sales to national customers, including chain restaurants and multi-locational restaurants, also comprise a significant portion of our overall volumes. gross margin on sales to our national customers is generally lower than on sales to other types of customers due to the higher volumes we sell to these customers. we are taking a disciplined approach to increasing our sales with national customers to profitably grow our business.
we offer an assortment of sysco-branded products that we can differentiate from privately branded products, which enables us to achieve higher gross profits. as a result, we focus on sales growth for these products, comprising 47% of u.s. broadline sales to locally managed customers in fiscal 2019. using customer insights, industry trends and innovative ideas, we launched new brands during fiscal 2019. we are introducing our brand to additional geographies outside the u.s. we have experienced continued success in category management and we are introducing this process in our european operations.
a portion of the cost to obtain products includes inbound freight. these costs have stabilized in fiscal 2019, but are still above pre-fiscal 2018 levels. inflation is a factor that contributes to the level of sales and gross profit growth and can be a factor that contributes to gross margin pressure. we experienced a modest level of inflation in fiscal 2019, with our u.s. broadline operations experiencing a rate of inflation of 1.5% primarily in the frozen category, principally for frozen potatoes, and the canned and dry, paper and disposables and produce categories. inflation has been higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, as compared to the beginning of the fiscal year. inflation for our u.s. broadline operations was 2.5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, principally in the poultry, meat, and produce categories. periods of high inflation, either overall or in certain product categories, can have an unfavorable effect on us and our customers, as high food costs can be difficult to pass on to our customers.
changes in exchange rates can impact our foreign sales as we convert them to u.s. dollars. in fiscal 2019, foreign exchange rates reduced our total sales by 0.8%.
we experienced higher operating expenses in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, due to investments we made in our business, particularly in our international segment, such as our integration of brake france and davigel into sysco france, from increased investments in technology for our business transformation initiatives and from increased supply chain costs in both transportation and warehouse, primarily in our u.s. operations. strength in the labor markets is a positive factor contributing to sales growth in the u.s. and canada; however, the tightening labor market in these geographies has an adverse effect on our operating expenses, including increased overtime expense and higher costs associated with hiring. we are addressing these challenges by continuing to drive productivity and focusing on retention initiatives for specialized recruiting, training and onboarding efforts to better retain talent in our supply chain operations, and we are experiencing positive results from these efforts. these expense increases were partially offset by benefits from our transformative initiatives and corporate expense management.
we have multiple transformational and operational initiatives underway, which include, among others:
•   improved customer-facing technology;
•   continued growth of our sysco-branded products through new and innovative products, as well as expanding the reach of these products in additional geographies beyond the u.s. and canada;
•   a finance transformation roadmap that modernizes our global financial platform. this initiative increases centralization and standardization of our end-to-end global processes and workflow and uses digital automation on a modern finance platform to improve efficiency;
•   a smart spending initiative, which is focused on reducing our indirect spend in certain categories to drive productivity and savings;
•   the integration of our businesses in france and ireland;
•   supply chain transformation projects in the u.k., including converting warehouses to accommodate multiple temperature zones; and
•   a canadian regionalization project, which is focused on streamlining our leadership and administrative support for our canadian operations, while maintaining an acute focus on our customers.
we believe these initiatives will drive growth and profitability in the long-term.
our effective tax rate has been influenced by discrete events, such as tax law changes and excess tax benefits attributable to equity compensation exercises as discussed in note 20, "income taxes," in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. in fiscal 2020, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 24%.
we continue to be focused on mergers and acquisitions as a part of our strategy. we have completed several acquisitions in fiscal 2019 within our u.s. foodservice operations and our international foodservice operations as follows:
u.s. foodservice operations
•   in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we acquired j &amp; m wholesale meats and imperio foods, inc., leading california distributors with approximately $44 million in combined annual sales. j &amp; m wholesale meats and imperio foods, inc., sister companies based out of modesto, california, operate throughout northern california and oregon.
•   in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we acquired waugh foods, inc., a leading illinois broadline distributor with approximately $40 million in annual sales; and in addition to the acquisitions noted above, in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we purchased the remaining interests in iowa premium, making the previously consolidated entity a wholly owned subsidiary. sysco initially acquired an interest in the specialty meat company in fiscal 2014. we subsequently sold iowa premium in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and realized a gain of $66.3 million.
international foodservice operations
•   in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we acquired classic drinks, an established specialist wine and spirits distributor in ireland with approximately €42 million in annual sales.
in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we acquired j. kings food service professionals, a new york broadline distributor with approximately $150 million in annual sales.
strategy and fiscal 2020 three-year financial targets our objective to improve the overall customer experience is a core element of our success over the past few years and will continue to be a key focus as we move forward. we have identified four strategic priorities that will accelerate our current growth and guide us into the future. these priorities are to enrich the customer experience, deliver operational excellence, optimize our business and activate the power of our people.
fiscal 2019 is the second year in our current three-year plan that was established in fiscal 2018 and includes our strategic and financial objectives through fiscal 2020, which will enable us to continue transforming our business, while improving the customer experience of doing business with sysco. our target financial objectives set at the beginning of our current three-year plan cycle, included:
•   reaching $650 million to $700 million of adjusted operating income growth as compared to fiscal 2017;
•   growing earnings per share faster than operating income; and
•   achieving 16% in adjusted return on invested capital improvement for existing businesses.
while we continue to experience improved operating performance year-over-year, our volume growth is lower than originally anticipated, and we have incurred increased expenses. due to these items, combined with the impact of our sale of iowa premium, we are lowering our fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2020 adjusted operating income growth target to approximately $600 million.
in accomplishing these goals, we believe that, by fiscal 2020, we could also achieve, as compared to fiscal 2017, (1) case growth of 2.5% to 3.0%, of which local case growth would contribute 3.0% to 3.3%; (2) sales and gross profit growth of 3.5% to 4.0%; (3) adjusted operating income growth of 8%; and (4) adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of approximately 15%. the objectives targeted in our three-year plan included the impact of the tax act. the key levers to achieve these targets include an emphasis on accelerating locally managed customer case growth and driving leverage between gross profit growth and expense growth.
our operating income goal was established on an adjusted basis given certain item charges that were applicable in fiscal 2017, which primarily were due to restructuring and brakes-related acquisitions costs. the business transformation initiatives we have in place will allow us to continue to grow our business and capitalize on our strong fundamentals. we are placing further emphasis on assessing our work in order to effectively centralize and standardize our business, including leveraging technology and strengthening sysco overall. we will continue to focus on strong implementation and execution, while accelerating some of this work, all of which better position us to achieve our financial objectives.

based on information in note 22, "business segment information," in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8, in fiscal 2019, u.s. foodservice operations and international foodservice operations represented approximately 68.7% and 19.1%, respectively, of sysco's overall sales, compared to 67.5% and 19.6%, respectively, in fiscal 2018. in fiscal 2019, u.s. foodservice operations and international foodservice operations represented approximately 94.4% and 3.7%, respectively, of the total segment operating income, compared to 92.2% and 5.8%, respectively in fiscal 2018. this illustrates that these segments represent a substantial majority of our total segment results when compared to other reportable segments.
cost of sales primarily includes our product costs, net of vendor consideration, and includes in-bound freight. operating expenses include the costs of facilities, product handling, delivery, selling and general and administrative activities. fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit; fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses. along with sales, operating income is the most relevant measure for evaluating segment performance and allocating resources, as operating income includes cost of goods sold, as well as the costs to warehouse and deliver goods, which are significant and relevant costs when evaluating a distribution business.
results of u.s. foodservice operations in fiscal 2019, the u.s. foodservice operations operating results represented approximately 68.7% of sysco's overall sales and 94.4% of the aggregated operating income of sysco's reporting segments. several factors contributed to these higher operating results as compared to the other operating segments. we have invested substantial amounts in assets, operating methods, technology and management expertise in this segment. the breadth of its sales force, geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power enable this segment to generate its relatively stronger results of operations.

(1)   case volume excludes the volume impact from our custom-cut meat and seafood companies that do not measure volume in cases. any impact in volumes from these operations are included within "other."
sales were 4.2% higher in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018. the largest drivers of the increase were case volume growth in our u.s. broadline operations and the impact of product cost inflation. case volumes for the company's u.s. broadline operations, including acquisitions within the last 12 months, increased 2.7% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and included a 3.1%
improvement in locally managed customer case growth, along with an increase of 2.3% in national customer case volume, including chain restaurants and multi-locational restaurants. sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months favorably impacted locally managed customer sales by 0.9%; therefore, organic local case volume, which excludes acquisitions, grew 2.2%.
operating income operating income increased by 4.4% in fiscal 2019 over fiscal 2018, as our gross profits grew on pace with operating expenses.
gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, driven primarily by growth in sales of sysco-branded products, year-over-year favorability of inbound freight and continued category management work. our case growth for sysco-branded sales to local customers increased 50 basis points in fiscal 2019. additionally, our customer mix has continued to improve, as we grew local cases at a faster pace than total cases. the change in product costs, an internal measure of inflation or deflation, was estimated as inflation of 1.5% during fiscal 2019 for our u.s. broadline operations. inflation in fiscal 2019 occurred primarily in the frozen category, principally for frozen potatoes, and the canned and dry, paper and disposables and produce categories.
operating expenses increased in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to increased costs in both transportation and warehouse resulting from the tight labor market combined with seasonal hiring of driver and warehouse staff, which drove increased operational costs on a per unit basis as volume softened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. an increase in our provisions for losses on receivables has also contributed to the increase in operating expenses primarily due to stronger performance in collections and recoveries of previously written off receivables in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2019.
results of international foodservice operations in fiscal 2019, the international foodservice operations operating results represented approximately 19.1% of sysco's overall sales and 3.7% of the aggregated operating income of sysco's segments, which excludes corporate expenses and adjustments.

sales were 0.2% lower in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018. the decrease for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to unfavorable changes in exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into u.s. dollars. additionally, we encountered operational challenges in france, as our efforts to integrate our businesses have negatively affected our ability to drive growth in sales. the decrease was partially offset by product cost inflation in europe and canada and a modest increase in volumes in canada, ireland and sweden. our businesses in latin america, primarily in costa rica and panama, have experienced continued growth in sales, partially offset by softness in our business in mexico, which in the fourth quarter began to show recovery from weaker performance earlier in fiscal 2019.
operating income operating income decreased by 35.3% in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of the continued strategic investments we are making across europe to drive continued future business performance. operating income, on an adjusted basis, increased by $34.3 million, or 10.7%, as compared to fiscal 2018.
gross profit dollars decreased $44.8 million in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to currency translation in europe and canada, partially offset by increasing product costs and local case growth in our canadian operations.
operating expenses increased $23.6 million in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to restructuring charges, largely in france, and supply chain transformation costs in the u.k. these activities resulted in restructuring charges that were combined with our brakes acquisition-related costs that are included within certain items. we incurred restructuring charges of $61.1 million relating to our france integration during fiscal 2019. operating expense, on an adjusted basis, decreased 3.7%, or $79.1 million, compared to fiscal 2018. we have also begun to leverage broader sysco capabilities and processes to deliver improved synergies across europe. additionally, our regionalization efforts in canada continue to deliver benefits and have helped to drive improved cost performance. changes in exchange rates used to translate our foreign operating expenses into u.s. dollars further contributed to a decrease in operating expenses.
results of sygma and other segment sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations.
sales sales were 4.8% lower in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018. the decrease for fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to a modest decline in case volumes, as we continue to focus on improving overall profitability.
operating income operating income increased by 14.2% in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, due to improved gross margins and solid expense management. gross margin increased 30 basis points driven by higher product margins, while operating expenses decreased 1.9% in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018. operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2019 largely due to decreases in transportation costs, primarily resulting from our focus on removing unproductive miles and streamlining operations at under-performing locations.
"other" segment information is attributable to our other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds, primarily including our hotel supply operations and sysco labs, which includes our suite of technology solutions that help support the business needs of our customers and provides support for some of our business technology needs.
operating income decreased 9.2%, or $3.6 million, in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018. the decrease was primarily attributable to unfavorable results from our hotel supply operations, partially offset by improved results from sysco labs. guest supply gross profit grew 2.3%, while operating expenses grew 7.1% during fiscal 2019.
corporate expenses corporate expenses in fiscal 2019 increased $67.2 million, or 6.9%, as compared to fiscal 2018, due primarily to an increase in expenses related to our business technology initiatives, including accelerated depreciation on certain enterprise resource planning (erp) systems and software platforms that we are no longer using, along with higher pay-related expenses, partly driven by higher severance and relocation charges. corporate expenses, on an adjusted basis, decreased $12.9 million, or 1.5%, as compared to fiscal 2018. certain items impacting fiscal 2019 totaled $171.1 million and were primarily expenses associated with our business transformation initiatives, as well as severance charges associated with our organizational changes, as compared to $91.0 million in fiscal 2018.
interest expense interest expense decreased $35.1 million in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to a favorable comparison to the prior year as a result of the redemption of certain series of senior notes and debentures pursuant to a tender offer in fiscal 2018. interest charges related to the redemption costs noted above are considered certain items. excluding certain items, our interest expense increased $18.0 million in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018, due to higher floating interest rates and a higher average balance of fixed rate debt.
net earnings net earnings increased 17.0% in fiscal 2019, as compared to the prior year, due primarily to the items noted above for operating income and interest expense, as well as items impacting our income taxes that are discussed in note 20, "income taxes," in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. these included the favorable impact of foreign tax credits generated as a result of distributions to sysco from our foreign operations at the end of fiscal 2018, lower u.s. tax rates resulting from the enactment of the tax act and the favorable impact of excess tax benefits of equity-based compensation. adjusted net earnings increased 11.9% in fiscal 2019, primarily due to gross profit growth and favorable expense growth, including reduced administrative expense, partially offset by increased interest expense, which resulted in earnings growth that exceeded our operating income growth.
earnings per share basic earnings per share in fiscal 2019 were $3.24, an 18.2% increase from the fiscal 2018 amount of $2.74 per share. diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019 were $3.20, an 18.3% increase from the fiscal 2018 amount of $2.70 per share. adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019 were $3.55, a 13.1% increase from the fiscal 2018 amount of $3.14 per share. these results were primarily attributable to the factors discussed above related to net earnings and a decrease in outstanding shares that resulted from our share repurchases in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.
non-gaap reconciliations our discussion below and elsewhere herein of our results includes certain non-gaap financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. other than free cash flow, any non-gaap financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures and exclude the impact from restructuring and transformational project costs consisting of: (1) expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives; (2) severance and facility closure charges; and
(3) restructuring charges. our results of operations for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were also impacted by the following acquisition-related items: (1) intangible amortization expense and (2) integration costs. fiscal 2019 results of operations were impacted by a gain on the sale of iowa premium. in addition, fiscal 2018 results of operations were impacted by mepp withdrawal charges and debt extinguishment charges. sysco's results of operations for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were also impacted by reform measures from the tax act enacted on december 22, 2017. the impact for fiscal 2019 and 2018 includes a transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and the impact for fiscal 2019 also includes the recognition of a foreign tax credit applicable to repatriated earnings. the impact for fiscal 2018 includes: (1) a net benefit from remeasuring sysco's accrued income taxes, deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets due to the changes in tax rates; and (2) a benefit from contributions made to fund the u.s. retirement plan (pension plan). the fiscal 2019 and 2018 items described above and excluded from our non-gaap measures are collectively referred to as "certain items." all acquisition-related costs in fiscal 2019 and 2018 that have been designated as certain items relate to the fiscal 2017 brakes acquisition, discussed in note 5, "acquisitions," in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. in addition, with respect to the adjusted return on invested capital targets, our invested capital is adjusted for the accumulation of debt incurred for the brakes acquisition that would not have been borrowed absent this acquisition.
management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these certain items provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that (1) is indicative of the performance of the company's underlying operations, (2) facilitates comparisons on a year-over-year basis and (3) removes those items that are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated and that, as a result, are difficult to include in analysts' financial models and our investors' expectations with any degree of specificity.
although sysco has a history of growth through acquisitions, the brakes group was significantly larger than the companies historically acquired by sysco, with a proportionately greater impact on sysco's consolidated financial statements. accordingly, sysco is excluding from its non-gaap financial measures for the relevant period solely those acquisition costs specific to the brakes acquisition. we believe this approach significantly enhances the comparability of sysco's results for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.
the company uses these non-gaap measures when evaluating its financial results, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. these financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap measures in assessing the company's results of operations for periods presented. an analysis of any non-gaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap. as a result, in the table below, each period presented is adjusted for the impact described above. in the table below, individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add to the total presented due to rounding. adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding.

three-year financial targets sysco management considers adjusted return on invested capital (roic) to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the company's long-term capital investments. in addition, we have targets and expectations that are based on adjusted results, including an adjusted roic target of 16% under our three-year plan. we cannot predict with certainty whether or when we will achieve these results or whether the calculation of our roic in such future periods will be on an adjusted basis due to the effect of certain items, which would be excluded from such calculation. due to these uncertainties, to the extent our future calculation of roic is on an adjusted basis excluding certain items, we cannot provide a quantitative reconciliation of this non-gaap measure to the most directly comparable gaap measure without unreasonable effort. however, we would expect to calculate adjusted roic, if applicable, in the same manner as we have historically calculated this measure. all components of our adjusted roic calculation would be impacted by certain items. we calculate adjusted roic as adjusted net earnings divided by (i) stockholders' equity, computed as the average of adjusted stockholders' equity at the beginning of the year and at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year; and (ii) long-term debt, computed as the average of the long-term debt at the beginning of the year and at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year.
form of calculation:
net earnings (gaap)
impact of certain items on net earnings adjusted net earnings (non-gaap)
invested capital (gaap)
adjustments to invested capital adjusted invested capital (non-gaap)
return on invested capital (gaap)
return on invested capital (non-gaap)
additional targets and expectations for our three-year plan include target amounts for adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share. we cannot predict with certainty when we will achieve these results or whether the calculation of these measures in such future period will be on an adjusted basis due to the effect of certain items, which would be excluded from such calculation. due to uncertainties in projecting certain items during the period covered under our three-year strategic plan, we cannot provide a quantitative reconciliation of any of our non-gaap operating income, earnings per share or roic measures to the respective, most directly comparable gaap measures without unreasonable effort. however, we would expect to calculate these adjusted results in the same manner as the reconciliations provided for the historical periods that are presented herein. the impact of future certain items could cause projected non-gaap amounts to differ significantly from our gaap results.
liquidity and capital resources highlights below are comparisons of the cash flows from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018:
•   cash flows from operations were $2.4 billion in fiscal 2019, compared to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2018;
•   net capital expenditures totaled $671.5 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $665.6 million in fiscal 2018;
•   free cash flow was $1.7 billion in fiscal 2019, compared to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2018 (see "non-gaap reconciliation" below under the heading "free cash flow");
•   cash used for acquisition of businesses was $106.6 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $248.1 million in fiscal 2018;
•   cash proceeds from the sale of a business were $149.9 million in fiscal 2019;
•   dividends paid were $775.4 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $722.2 million in fiscal 2018; and
•   we repurchased approximately $1.0 billion of shares in fiscal 2019, compared to $978.9 million in fiscal 2018.
in addition, with regard to our senior notes:
•   our wholly owned canadian subsidiary issued an aggregate of cdn $500.0 million in new senior notes in fiscal 2019, and we issued an aggregate of $1.0 billion in new senior notes in fiscal 2018; and
•   we repaid senior notes in the amount of $750.0 million in fiscal 2019, utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances. we repaid senior notes in the amount of $500.0 million and redeemed senior notes and debentures in the amount of $230.5 million in fiscal 2018, using cash on hand, proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program and a portion of net proceeds from our senior notes offering.
sources and uses of cash sysco's strategic objectives include continuous investment in our business; these investments are funded by a combination of cash from operations and access to capital from financial markets. our operations historically have produced significant cash flow. cash generated from operations is generally allocated to:
•   working capital requirements;
•   investments in facilities, systems, fleet, other equipment and technology;
•   cash dividends;
•   acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy; and
•   debt repayments and share repurchases.
any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in high-quality, short-term instruments. as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis, we regularly evaluate business opportunities, including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses, and our overall capital structure. any transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity, borrowing capacity, leverage ratios and capital availability.
we continue to generate substantial cash flows from operations and remain in a strong financial position; however, our liquidity and capital resources can be influenced by economic trends and conditions that impact our results of operations. we believe our mechanisms to manage working capital, such as credit monitoring, optimizing inventory levels and maximizing payment terms with vendors, and our mechanisms to manage the items impacting our gross profits have been sufficient to limit a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations. we believe these mechanisms will continue to prevent a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations. seasonal trends also impact our cash flows from operations and free cash flow, as we use more cash earlier in the fiscal year and then see larger, sequential quarterly increases throughout the remainder of the year.
we extend credit terms to our customers that can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of each customer's credit worthiness. in the ordinary course of business, customers periodically negotiate extended payment terms on trade accounts receivable. the company may utilize purchase arrangements with third-party financial institutions to transfer portions of our trade accounts receivable balance on a non-recourse basis in order to extend terms for the customer without negatively impacting our cash flow. the arrangements meet the requirements for the receivables transferred to be accounted for as sales. see note 1, "summary of accounting policies" for additional information.
as of june 29, 2019, we had $513.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately 58% of which was held by our international subsidiaries generated from our earnings of international operations. if these earnings were transferred among countries or repatriated to the u.s., such amounts may be subject to withholding and additional foreign tax obligations. additionally, sysco corporation has provided intercompany loans to certain of its international subsidiaries, and when interest and principal payments are made, some of this cash will move to the u.s.
our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary (the captive) must maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to fund future reserve payments. as of june 29, 2019, the captive held $120.0 million of fixed income marketable securities and $18.8 million of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in a restricted investment portfolio in order to meet solvency requirements. we purchased $116.4 million in marketable securities in fiscal 2019, of which none were sold during the year.
we believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months, while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes:
•   our cash flows from operations;
•   the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs, supported by our revolving credit facility and bank line of credit; and
•   our ability to access capital from financial markets, including issuances of debt securities, either privately or under our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission (sec).
due to our strong financial position, we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access the commercial paper market and long-term capital markets, if necessary.
cash flows operating activities we generated $2.4 billion and $2.2 billion in cash flows from operations in fiscal 2019 and in fiscal 2018, respectively. these amounts include year-over-year favorable comparisons on other long-term liabilities and accrued expenses, as well as higher operating results, partially offset by unfavorable comparisons on accrued income taxes. the cash impact of our certain items increased $51.1 million year-over-year. the cash impact of certain items can differ from the earnings impact of certain items, as the payments for these items may occur in a different period from the period in which the certain item charges were recognized in the statement of consolidated results of operations.
the change in other long-term liabilities was impacted primarily by the positive comparison of pension contributions made in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. pension contributions were $37.2 million in fiscal 2019 and $415.0 million in fiscal 2018, including a $380 million contribution to the u.s. retirement plan in fiscal 2018.
the positive comparison on accrued expenses was primarily due to a $70.1 million increase in accrued severance primarily related to restructuring in our european operations, and a $34.2 million decrease in mepp liability payments.
our tax payments in fiscal 2019 were higher than in fiscal 2018 as a result of the tax act, primarily due to the impact on fiscal 2018 of certain capital allocation initiatives in the u.s., such as funding our pension plan and fleet spend acceleration, as well as payment in fiscal 2019 of canadian withholding taxes attributable to the repatriation of canadian earnings at the end of fiscal 2018. we made tax payments of approximately $531.1 million in fiscal 2019. we expect future tax payments to grow with our earnings.
investing activities fiscal 2019 capital expenditures included:
•   buildings and building improvements;
•   investments in technology;
•   fleet replacements; and
•   warehouse equipment.
fiscal 2018 capital expenditures included:
•   fleet replacements;
•   buildings and building improvements;
•   investments in technology; and
•   warehouse equipment.
the level of gross capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 increased $4.6 million as compared to fiscal 2018.
we estimate our capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, in fiscal 2020 to be approximately 1.3% of fiscal sales. fiscal 2020 expenditures are expected to include facility expansions and new facility construction; fleet and other equipment purchases, including replacements; and investments in technology.
during fiscal 2019, the company paid cash of $106.6 million for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, including waugh foods, inc., j & m wholesale meats and imperio foods, inc. within u.s. foodservice operations, classic drinks and the remaining interest in iowa premium, making the previously consolidated entity a wholly owned subsidiary, which was subsequently sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.
during fiscal 2018, the company paid cash of $248.1 million for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, including hfm foodservice and doerle food services within u.s. foodservice operations, and kent frozen foods, eko fågel, fisk & mittemellan and the remaining 50% interest in our joint venture in costa rica within our international foodservice operations.
during fiscal 2019, the company received $149.9 million in proceeds from the sale of a business. these dispositions resulted in a recognized gain of $66.3 million, which is included within other income in the consolidated results of operations.
free cash flow free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities, less purchases of plant and equipment, plus proceeds from sales of plant and equipment. sysco considers free cash flow to be a non-gaap liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings, fleet, equipment and technology, which may potentially be used to pay for, among other things, strategic uses of cash, including dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions. however, free cash flow may not be available for discretionary expenditures, as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments. our free cash flow for fiscal 2019 increased 16.8%, or $249.9 million, to $1.7 billion, as compared to fiscal 2018, principally as a result of a year-over-year increase in cash flows from operations.
non-gaap reconciliation free cash flow should not be used as a substitute for the most comparable gaap measure in assessing the company's liquidity for the periods presented. an analysis of any non-gaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap. in the table that follows, free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities.

financing activities equity transactions proceeds from exercises of share-based compensation awards were $253.1 million in fiscal 2019 and $268.8 million in fiscal 2018. the level of option exercises, and thus proceeds, will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price and the time remaining before option grants expire.
we routinely engage in share repurchase programs. we repurchased a total of 14,963,189 shares in fiscal 2019 for $1.0 billion and 17,930,114 shares in fiscal 2018 for $978.9 million. in february 2017, our board of directors approved a repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of shares of the company's common stock not to exceed $1.0 billion through the end of fiscal
2019, all of which were executed through august 2018. in november 2017, our board of directors approved a separate repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of the company's common stock not to exceed $1.5 billion through the end of fiscal 2020. we have repurchased approximately 20,500 additional shares for $1.4 million in fiscal 2020 through august 9, 2019. the current repurchase program is intended to allow sysco to continue offsetting dilution resulting from shares issued under the company's benefit plans and to make opportunistic repurchases. in fiscal 2020, we intend to increase the share repurchase amount to over $1 billion, which repurchases will involve opportunistic purchases and purchases to offset dilution resulting from shares issued under the company's benefit plans. in august 2019, our board of directors approved a separate repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of the company's common stock not to exceed $2.5 billion through the end of fiscal 2021.
we have made dividend payments to our shareholders in each fiscal year since our company's inception. dividends paid were $775.4 million, or $1.50 per share, in fiscal 2019 and $722.2 million, or $1.38 per share, in fiscal 2018. in may 2019, we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 of $0.39 per share, which was paid in july 2019. we expect to continue to grow our dividend in fiscal 2020.
in august 2018, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, had the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. the specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements.
in november 2000, we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering 30,000,000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions. as of august 9, 2019, 29,477,835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement.
debt activity and borrowing availability our debt activity, including issuances and repayments, and our borrowing availability is described in note 13, "debt and other financing arrangements," in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. our outstanding borrowings at june 29, 2019, and repayment activity since the end of fiscal 2019 are disclosed within those notes. updated amounts at august 9, 2019, include:
•   $466.2 million outstanding from our commercial paper program; and
•   no amounts outstanding from the credit facility supporting the company's u.s. commercial paper program.
our aggregate commercial paper issuances and short-term bank borrowings had weighted average interest rates of 2.47% for fiscal 2019 and 1.71% for fiscal 2018.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

(1)   the estimate of the timing of future payments under the executive deferred compensation plan and management savings plan involves the use of certain assumptions, including retirement ages and payout periods.
(2)   includes estimated contributions to the unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan (serp) and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fiscal 2029, based on actuarial assumptions.
(3)   unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting standards related to uncertain tax positions. as of june 29, 2019, we had a liability of $26.1 million for unrecognized tax benefits for all tax jurisdictions and $4.6 million for related interest that could result in cash payment, of which $10.9 million could settle in cash. we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time. accordingly, the related balances have not been reflected in the "payments due by period" section of the table.
(4)   includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of june 29, 2019, assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity, and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates. the impact of our outstanding fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on the fixed rate debt interest payments is included as well based on the floating rates in effect as of june 29, 2019.
(5)   for purposes of this table, purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business, for which all significant terms have been confirmed, including minimum quantities resulting from our category management initiative. as we progress with this initiative, our purchase obligations are increasing. such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates. purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with various third-party service providers to provide information technology services for periods up to fiscal 2024 (see discussion under note 21, "commitments and contingencies," to the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8). purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required.
certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration, typically payable only if certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved. aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of june 29, 2019 were $18.9 million. this amount is not included in the table above.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements. significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements.
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations. these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure. our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, share-based compensation and company-sponsored pension plans.
goodwill and intangible assets we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that, once control of a business is obtained, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. we use multiple valuation methods to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. for intangible assets, we generally use the income method, which uses a forecast of the expected future net cash flows associated with each asset. these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows. determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment, as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives. any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. more information on our acquisitions can be found in note 5, "acquisitions," in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8.
annually in our fourth quarter, we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles by determining whether the fair values exceed the carrying values of these assets. impairment reviews, outside our annual review time frame, are performed if events or circumstances occur that include changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, other relevant entity-specific events, specific events affecting the reporting unit or sustained decrease in share price. our testing may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment; however, if a qualitative assessment is performed and we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, a quantitative test is performed.
when using a quantitative test, we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings or revenue multiple models. the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each reporting unit. we use a higher weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation compared to the earnings multiple models because the forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate management's outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses consistent with a market participant. the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry, including control premiums, earnings or revenue multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past, future cash flow estimates of the reporting units, which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates, and weighted average cost of capital, along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements. when possible, we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units.
our estimates of fair value contain uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections, resulting in the company revising its assumptions and, if required, recognizing an impairment loss. there were no impairments of goodwill recorded as a result of assessment in fiscal 2019. sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during fiscal 2019. we do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future, but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units. in the fiscal 2019 assessment, impairment charges would have been applicable for two reporting units if our estimates of fair value were decreased by 13% and 15%, respectively, with goodwill of $226.0 million in the aggregate as of june 29, 2019, recorded for these reporting units.
certain reporting units have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the u.s. broadline, canada broadline or sygma reporting units. this is primarily due to these businesses having been more recently acquired, and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the u.s. broadline, canadian broadline and sygma reporting units. as such, these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn.
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various u.s. federal and state, as well as foreign, jurisdictions. jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances, and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment in estimating the exposures associated with our various filing positions. we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable; however, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
share-based compensation sysco provides compensation benefits to employees and non-employee directors under several share-based payment arrangements including various employee stock option plans, a non-employee director plan and the 2015 employee stock purchase plan (espp).
as of june 29, 2019, there was $116.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation arrangements. that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black-scholes option pricing model. expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco's stock, implied volatilities from traded options on sysco's stock and other factors. we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant. the risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
the fair value of each restricted stock unit award and performance share unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company's stock price as of the date of grant. for restricted stock units and performance share units granted without dividend equivalents, the fair value is reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period. expense recognized on performance share unit awards is subsequently adjusted based on forecasted performance compared to planned targets until the performance period concludes and the actual number of shares of sysco common stock to be received upon the vesting of the performance share units is known.
the fair value of the stock issued under the espp is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price.
the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees or non-employee directors is based on the stock price on grant date. the application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a post-vesting restriction.
the compensation cost related to these share-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period. the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the espp is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made.
our share-based awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period. we will recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.
in addition, certain of our share-based awards provide that the awards continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director if the award holder meets certain age and years of service thresholds upon retirement. in these cases, we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the grant date to the date the employee or director first becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to vest after retirement.
our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes. in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded, a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options. we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option. in such cases, we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate.
company-sponsored pension plans amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis. two of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets. our u.s. retirement plan is largely frozen and is only open to a small number of employees. our serp is frozen and is not open to any employees. none of these plans have a significant sensitivity to changes in discount rates specific to our results of operations, but such changes could impact our balance sheet due to a change in our funded status. due to the low level of active employees in our retirement plans, our assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation is not a critical assumption.
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of the u.s. retirement plan is 5.00% for fiscal 2019, consistent with fiscal 2018. the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds, historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments. the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate.
the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of the u.s. retirement plan is 5.00% for fiscal 2020, consistent with fiscal 2019. investments in the portfolio have been reallocated to a higher portion of fixed income assets, resulting in a lower expected long-term rate of return. a 100 basis point increase (decrease) in the assumed rate of return in the plan for fiscal 2020 would decrease (increase) sysco's net company-sponsored pension costs for fiscal 2019 by approximately $39 million.
pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june 29, 2019 was a charge, net of tax, of $1.2 billion. the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june 30, 2018 was a charge, net of tax, of $1.1 billion.

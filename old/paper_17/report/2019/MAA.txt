item 1a. risk factors.
in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, we have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations. investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impact our business operations. if any of these risks occur, our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, the market price of our capital stock and the trading price of our debt securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our capital stock or debt securities.
risks related to our real estate investments and our operations unfavorable market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels, rental revenues and the value of our properties.
unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of the properties and our ability to acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. our ability to lease our apartment communities at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, personal debt levels, a downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline. we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues and/or the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to make payments on our debt and to make distributions, which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of our securities. factors that may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our apartment communities include the following, among others:
•   downturns in global, national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment;

•   declines in mortgage interest rates and home pricing, making alternative housing more affordable;

•   government or builder incentives with respect to home ownership, making alternative housing options more attractive;

•   local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of apartments or other housing available for rent, or a reduction in demand for apartments in the area;

•   declines in the financial condition of our residents, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some residents;

•   declines in market rental rates;

•   declines in household formation; and

•   increases in operating costs, if these costs cannot be passed through to our residents.

failure to generate sufficient cash flow could limit our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions.
our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions depends on our ability to generate cash flow in excess of operating costs and capital expenditure requirements and/or to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing. our funds from operations may be insufficient because of factors that are beyond our control. such events or conditions could include:
•   competition from other apartment communities;

•   overbuilding of new apartments or oversupply of available apartments in our markets, which might adversely affect occupancy or rental rates and/or require rent concessions in order to lease apartments;

•   conversion of condominiums and single family houses to rental use or the increase in the number of condominiums and single family homes available for sale;

•   weakness in the overall economy, which lowers job growth and the associated demand for apartment housing;

•   increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes, utilities and insurance premiums) due to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset by increased rental rates;

•   inability to initially, or subsequently after lease terminations, rent apartments on favorable economic terms;

•   failure of development communities to be completed within budget and on a timely basis, if at all, or to lease-up as anticipated;

•   changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance;

•   changes in laws including, but not limited to, tax laws and housing laws including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing;

•   an uninsured loss, including those resulting from a catastrophic storm, earthquake, or act of terrorism;

•   changes in interest rate levels and the availability of financing, borrower credit standards, and down-payment requirements which could lead renters to purchase homes (if interest rates decrease and home loans are more readily

8
available) or increase our acquisition and operating costs (if interest rates increase and financing is less readily available); and

•   the relative illiquidity of real estate investments.

at times, we have relied on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program, including our existing property developments. while we have sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings, if necessary, any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to make payments on our debt and to make distributions at the current rate, in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate. any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or the trading price of our debt securities.
we are dependent on a concentration of our investments in a single asset class, making our results of operations more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in the sector or other economic factors.
as of december 31, 2019, substantially all of our investments are concentrated in the multifamily sector. as a result, we will be subject to risks inherent in investments in a single type of property. a downturn or slowdown in the demand for multifamily housing may have more pronounced effects on our results of operations or on the value of our assets than if we had diversified our investments into more than one asset class.
our operations are concentrated in the southeast, southwest and mid-atlantic regions of the united states; we are subject to general economic conditions in the regions in which we operate.
as of december 31, 2019, approximately 39.9% of our portfolio is located in our top five markets:  atlanta, georgia; dallas, texas; austin, texas; charlotte, north carolina; and orlando, florida.  in addition, our overall operations are concentrated in the southeast, southwest and mid-atlantic regions of the united states. our performance could be adversely affected by economic conditions in, and other factors relating to, these geographic areas, including supply and demand for apartments in these areas, zoning and other regulatory conditions and competition from other communities and alternative forms of housing. in particular, our performance is disproportionately influenced by job growth and unemployment. to the extent the economic conditions, job growth and unemployment in any of these markets deteriorate or any of these areas experiences natural disasters, the value of our portfolio, our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions could be adversely affected.
failure to succeed in new markets may have adverse consequences on our performance.
we may make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise. our historical experience in our existing markets does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets, should we choose to enter them. we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets, including an inability to accurately evaluate local market conditions, to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities, to hire and retain key personnel and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures. in addition, we may abandon opportunities to enter new markets that we have begun to explore for any reason and may, as a result, fail to recover expenses already incurred.
substantial competition among apartment communities and real estate companies may adversely affect our revenues and development and acquisition opportunities.
there are numerous other apartment communities and real estate companies, some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we have, within the market area of each of our communities that compete with us for residents and development and acquisition opportunities.  the number of competitive apartment communities and real estate companies in these areas could have a material effect on (1) our ability to rent our apartments and generate revenues, and (2) development and acquisition opportunities. the activities of these competitors could cause us to pay a higher price for a new property than we otherwise would have paid or may prevent us from purchasing a desired property at all, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions.
acts of violence could decrease the value of our assets and could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
our apartment communities could directly or indirectly be the location or target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks, crimes, shootings or other acts of violence, the occurrence of which could impact the value of our communities through damage, destruction, loss or increased security costs, as well as result in operational losses due to reduced rental demand, and the availability of insurance may be limited or may be subject to substantial costs.  if such an incident were to occur at one of our apartment communities, we may also become subject to significant liability claims. in addition, the adverse effects that actual or threatened terrorist attacks could have on national economic conditions, as well as economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
9
we rely on information technology systems in our operations, and any breach or security failure of those systems could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.
we rely on proprietary and third-party information technology systems to process, transmit and store information and to manage or support our business processes. we store and maintain confidential financial and business information regarding us and persons with which we do business on our information technology systems. we also collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing and property management activities, and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our employees in connection with their employment. in addition, we engage third party service providers that may collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents, prospective residents and employees in connection with providing business services to us, including web hosting, property management, leasing, accounting and payroll services. the protection of the information technology systems on which we rely is critically important to us. we take steps, and generally require third party service providers to take steps, to protect the security of the information maintained in our and our service providers' information technology systems, including the use of systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing of the information. however, we face risks associated with breaches or security failures of the information technology systems on which we rely, which could result from, among other incidents, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses or employee error or misconduct. this risk of a data breach or security failure, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion, has generally increased due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of the perpetrators of attempted attacks and intrusions.
the security measures put in place by us and our service providers cannot provide absolute security and there can be no assurance that we or our service providers will not suffer a data security incident in the future, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive information stored on our or our service providers' systems, that such access will not, whether temporarily or permanently, impact, interfere with or interrupt our operations, or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner. even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable as the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed to not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.  in addition, third-party information technology providers may not provide us with fixes or updates to hardware or software in a manner as to avoid an unauthorized loss or disclosure or to address a known vulnerability, which may subject us to known threats or downtime as a result of those delays. accordingly, we and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures. further, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to enhance information security measures and internal processes and procedures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
a data security incident could compromise our or our service providers' information technology systems, and the information stored by us or our service providers, including personally identifiable information of residents, prospective residents and employees, could be accessed, misused, publicly disclosed, corrupted, lost or stolen. any failure to prevent a data breach or a security failure of our or our service providers' information technology systems could interrupt our operations, result in downtime, divert our planned efforts and resources from other projects, damage our reputation and brand, damage our competitive position, make it difficult for us to attract and retain residents, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. similarly, if our service providers fail to use adequate security or data protection processes, or use personal data in an unpermitted or improper manner, we may be liable for certain losses and it may damage our reputation.
acquisitions of apartment communities involve various risks and may fail to meet expectations.
we have acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:
•   we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;

•   even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the acquisition;

•   even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after incurring certain acquisition-related costs;

•   we may incur significant costs and divert management's attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are subsequently unable to complete;

•   when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing revenues and profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in revenues or profitability;

•   we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability; and

•   we may acquire properties that are subject to liabilities or that have problems relating to environmental condition, state of title, physical condition or compliance with zoning laws, building codes or other legal requirements and in each case,

10
our acquisition may be without any, or with only limited, recourse with respect to unknown liabilities or conditions and we may be obligated to pay substantial sums to settle or cure it, which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results.

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility.
we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities:
•   a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales. in addition, if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis. intermediary agents of section 1031 exchange transactions typically handle large sums of money in trusts. misappropriation of funds by one of these agents could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. additionally, misappropriation of funds could result in the disposal of the property not qualifying for a tax deferred basis and adversely affect our financial condition. it is also possible the qualification of a transaction as a section 1031 exchange could be successfully challenged and determined to be currently taxable. in such case, our taxable income and earnings and profits would increase, which could increase the dividend income to our shareholders by reducing any return of capital they received. in some circumstances, we may be required to pay additional dividends or, in lieu of additional dividends, corporate income tax, possibly including interest and penalties. as a result, we may be required to borrow funds in order to pay additional dividends or taxes and the payment of such taxes could cause us to have less cash available to distribute to our shareholders. in addition, if a section 1031 exchange were later to be determined to be taxable, we may be required to amend our tax returns for the applicable year in question, including any information reports sent to our shareholders; and

•   federal tax laws applicable to reits limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable.

property ownership through joint ventures could limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest.
from time to time, we may acquire and/or develop properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. in that case, we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. moreover, our partners could have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. in some instances, our partners could have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. also, our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses.  in general, we and our partners could each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners' interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the joint venture (if we are the seller) or of our partners' interest in the joint venture (if we are the buyer) at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm's length marketing process. other potential risks of a jointly-owned property include (i) a deadlock if we and our partners are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions, (ii) a limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the partnership or joint venture without the consent of the other partners and (iii) a requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture.
environmental problems are possible and can be costly.
under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances in, on, around or under such property. such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. the presence of, or failure to properly remediate, hazardous, toxic substances or petroleum product releases may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using the property as collateral. persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility, whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person. certain environmental laws impose liability for the release of asbestos-containing materials into the air, and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with asbestos-
11
containing materials and other hazardous or toxic substances. federal and state laws also regulate the operation and subsequent removal of certain underground storage tanks. in connection with the current or former ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management, development or control of real property, we may be considered an owner or operator of such apartment communities or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore, may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other costs, including governmental fines, and claims for injuries to persons and property.
our current policy is to obtain a phase i environmental study on each apartment community that we seek to acquire or develop, which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling, and to proceed accordingly. we cannot assure you, however, that the phase i environmental studies or other environmental studies undertaken with respect to any of our current or future apartment communities will reveal:
•   all or the full extent of potential environmental liabilities;

•   that any prior owner or operator of a property did not create any material environmental condition unknown to us;

•   that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of such apartment communities; or

•   that environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions.

certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period. a transfer of the property does not relieve an owner of such liability. thus, we may have liability with respect to apartment communities previously sold by our predecessors or by us.  there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and operators of multifamily apartment communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate. some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold-related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements separately. we have obtained a separate pollution insurance policy that covers mold-related claims and have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our apartment communities as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold. to the extent not covered by our pollution policy, the presence of mold could expose us to liability from residents and others if property damage or health concerns, or allegations thereof, arise.
extreme weather or natural disasters may cause property damage or disrupt business, which could harm our business and results of operations.
we have apartment communities located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather and natural disasters, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, winds, floods, hurricanes and fires, the likelihood or frequency of which events could increase in part based on the potential impact of climate change.  such conditions may damage our properties, disrupt our operations and adversely impact our tenants.  there can be no assurances that such conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business.
losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage, which may negatively impact our results of operations and reduce the value of our properties.
we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our apartment communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for apartment communities we acquire in the future. some losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from floods, hurricanes or earthquakes, are subject to limitations, and thus may be uninsured. we exercise our discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance, with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms. if we suffer a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment. inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed.  any losses we experience that are not fully covered by our insurance may negatively impact our results of operations and may reduce the value of our properties.
increasing real estate taxes, utilities and insurance premiums may negatively impact operating results.
as a result of our substantial real estate holdings, the cost of real estate taxes, utilities and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense. real estate taxes, utilities and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, which can be widely outside of our control. for example, the potential impact of climate change and the increased risk of extreme weather events and natural disasters could cause a significant increase in our insurance premiums and adversely affect the availability of coverage. if the costs associated with real estate taxes, utilities and insurance premiums should rise, without being offset by a corresponding increase in revenues, our results of operations could be negatively impacted, and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions could be adversely affected.
12
compliance or failure to comply with laws and regulations, including those requiring access to our properties by disabled persons, could have an adverse effect on our operations.
we must own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop our properties in compliance with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations.  for example, the americans with disabilities act of 1990, the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal, state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants. these laws may require us to modify our existing apartment communities. these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs. we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws, which may be substantial.
we do not know whether the legal requirements we are subject to will change or whether new requirements will be imposed.  changes in laws and regulations could require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures, impose limitations on our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees or otherwise adversely impact our operations.  for example, we generally have seen growing activism from tenant advocacy groups, which often urge state and local governments to consider enacting rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations as well as tenants' rights laws and regulations.  any such future enactments in the markets in which we operate could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and the value of our properties.
development and construction risks could impact our profitability.
as of december 31, 2019, we had seven development communities under construction totaling 2,108 units. we may make further investments in these and other development communities as opportunities arise and may do so through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties.  our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks:
•   we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations;

•   we may be unable to obtain financing for development activities under favorable terms, which could cause a delay in construction resulting in increased costs, decreases in revenue and potentially cause us to abandon the opportunity;

•   yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget, higher than expected concessions for lease-up and lower rents than initially estimated;

•   bankruptcy of developers in our development projects could impose delays and costs on us with respect to the development of our communities and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations;

•   we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities;

•   we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of an apartment community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs;

•   occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed apartment community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community;

•   when we sell to third parties apartment communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defects that are uninsured or exceed the limit of our insurance;

•   our failure to successfully enter into a joint venture agreement may prohibit an otherwise advantageous investment if we cannot raise the money through other means; and

•   adoption of laws and regulations designed to address climate change and its effects, including, for example, "green" building codes, could increase our costs of development and cause delays in the construction of our development communities.

short-term leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents and we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire.
our apartment leases are generally for a term of one year or less. as these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty, our revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms.  if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
legal proceedings that we become involved in from time to time could adversely affect our business.
as an owner, operator and developer of multifamily apartment communities, we may become involved in various legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, proceedings related to commercial, development, employment, environmental, securities, shareholder, tenant or tort legal issues, some of which could result in a class action lawsuit.  for example, as described in more detail
13
in "legal proceedings" and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, we are currently a defendant in two class action lawsuits relating to tenant late fee policies at our texas apartment communities.
legal proceedings, if decided adversely to or settled by us, and not covered by insurance, could result in liability material to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  likewise, regardless of outcome, legal proceedings could result in substantial costs and expenses, affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage and significantly divert the attention of our management. there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, any pending or future legal proceedings to which we become subject.
risks related to our indebtedness and financing activities our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
as of december 31, 2019, the amount of our total debt was approximately $4.5 billion. we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with, among other things, our acquisition, development and operating activities.
the degree of our leverage creates significant risks, including the following:
•   we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our funds from operations to servicing our debt and our cash flow may be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest;

•   debt service obligations will reduce funds available for distribution and funds available for acquisitions, development and redevelopment;

•   we may be more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns than our competitors that have less debt;

•   we may be limited in our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions;

•   we may default on our indebtedness, which could result in acceleration of those obligations, assignment of rents and leases and loss of properties to foreclosure; and

•   if one of our subsidiaries defaults, it could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration provision under other indebtedness, which could cause an immediate default or could allow the lenders to declare all funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable.

if any one of these events was to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we may be unable to renew, repay or refinance our outstanding debt, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, the risk that either secured or unsecured indebtedness will not be able to be renewed, repaid or refinanced when due or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness. if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, if at all, we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our apartment communities on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses to us. such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions. furthermore, if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property, appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies, all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value. foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code.
rising interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
we have incurred and expect in the future to incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. interest rates could increase, which could result in higher interest expense on our variable-rate debt or increase interest rates when refinancing maturing fixed-rate debt, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead holders of shares of our common stock to demand a higher yield on their shares from distributions by us, which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. any increase in the federal funds rate due to key economic indicators, such as the unemployment rate or inflation, may cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. any continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the uncertainty regarding the potential phase-out of libor could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.
libor is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the london interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally.  libor is the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our variable
14
rate debt, including our unsecured revolving credit facility.  libor is expected to be phased out after 2021, when private-sector banks are no longer required to report the information used to set the rate. without this data, libor may no longer be published, or the lack of quality and quantity of data may cause the rate to no longer be representative of the market. at this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to libor, although the u.s. federal reserve, in connection with the alternative reference rates committee, a steering committee comprised of large u.s. financial institutions, is considering replacing u.s. dollar libor with the secured overnight financing rate, or sofr. sofr is a more generic measure than libor and considers the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by u.s. treasury securities. given the inherent differences between libor and sofr or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established, there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from libor, including, but not limited to, how this will impact our cost of variable rate debt. the consequences of these developments with respect to libor cannot be entirely predicted and will span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.
we may incur additional debt in the future, which may adversely impact our financial condition.
we currently fund the acquisition and development of apartment communities partially through borrowings (including our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility) as well as from other sources such as sales of apartment communities which no longer meet our investment criteria. in addition, we may fund other of our capital requirements through additional debt. our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur, and we may incur more debt in the future. accordingly, subject to limitations on indebtedness set forth in various loan agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes, we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service and an increased risk of default on our obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, our ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions.
the restrictive terms of certain of our indebtedness may cause acceleration of debt payments.
as of december 31, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings of approximately $4.5 billion. our indebtedness contains financial covenants as to interest coverage ratios, maximum secured debt, maintenance of unencumbered asset value, and total debt to gross assets, among others, and cross default provisions with other material debt. our ability to comply with these financial covenants may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance, changes in general business and economic conditions, adverse regulatory developments or other events adversely impacting us. in the event that an event of default occurs, our lenders may declare borrowings under the respective loan agreements to be due and payable immediately, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions.
failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect our results of operations.
from time to time, we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest rate swap agreements. these agreements involve risks, such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable. hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions.
a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we have a significant amount of debt outstanding.  we are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from each of the three ratings agencies based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness.  these ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality and sustainability of cash flows and earnings.  if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, we could be required to pay additional interest and fees on our outstanding borrowings.  in addition, a downgrade may adversely impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and otherwise limit our access to capital, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
financing may not be available and could be dilutive.
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities, development and capital expenditures, costs of operations and potential acquisitions. we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements. if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated.
we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time. dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit markets could impact liquidity in the debt markets, which could result in financing terms that are less attractive to us and/or the unavailability of certain types of debt financing.  likewise, disruptions could impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations.  should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds again becomes limited, or be available only on unattractive terms, we will incur increased costs
15
associated with issuing debt instruments.  in addition, it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt and/or react to changing economic and business conditions.  uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing.  potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our securities to fluctuate significantly and/or to decline.  if we issue additional equity securities to obtain additional financing, the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted.
risks related to maa's organization and ownership of its stock maa's ownership limit restricts the transferability of its capital stock.
maa's charter limits ownership of its capital stock by any single shareholder to 9.9% of the value of all outstanding shares of its capital stock, both common and preferred, unless approved by its board of directors. the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in it losing reit status. this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of its shares or in five or fewer persons, applying certain broad attribution rules of the code, owning 50% or more of its shares. if an investor acquires shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits, maa:
•   will consider the transfer to be null and void;

•   will not reflect the transaction on its books;

•   may institute legal action to enjoin the transaction;

•   will not pay dividends or other distributions with respect to those shares;

•   will not recognize any voting rights for those shares;

•   will consider the shares held in trust for its benefit; and

•   will either direct the holder to sell the shares and turn over any profit to maa, or maa will redeem the shares. if maa redeems the shares, the holder will be paid a price equal to the lesser of:

o   the principal price paid for the shares by the holder,

o   a price per share equal to the market price (as determined in the manner set forth in its charter) of the applicable capital stock,

o   the market price (as so determined) on the date such holder would, but for the restrictions on transfers set forth in its charter, be deemed to have acquired ownership of the shares, and

o   the maximum price allowed under the tennessee greenmail act (such price being the average of the highest and lowest closing market price for the shares during the 30 trading days preceding the purchase of such shares or, if the holder of such shares has commenced a tender offer or has announced an intention to seek control of maa, during the 30 trading days preceding the commencement of such tender offer or the making of such announcement).

the redemption price may be paid, at maa's option, by delivering one common unit (subject to adjustment from time to time in the event of, among other things, stock splits, stock dividends or recapitalizations affecting its common stock or certain mergers, consolidations or asset transfers by maa) issued by the operating partnership for each excess share being redeemed.
if an investor acquires shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above:
•   the holder may lose its power to dispose of the shares;

•   the holder may not recognize profit from the sale of such shares if the market price of the shares increases; and

•   the holder may be required to recognize a loss from the sale of such shares if the market price decreases.

future offerings of debt or equity securities, which may rank senior to our common stock, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
if we decide to issue additional debt securities in the future, which would rank senior to our common stock, it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. additionally, any equity securities or convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. we and, indirectly, our shareholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings. thus, holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings.
16
the form, timing and amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations.
though our board of directors has a history of declaring dividends in advance of the quarter they are paid, the form, timing and amount of dividend distributions will be declared, and standing practice changed, at the discretion of the board of directors.  the form, timing and amount of dividend distributions will depend on actual cash from operations, our financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant. our board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time.
provisions of maa's charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of maa.
ownership limit the 9.9% ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of maa by a third party without the consent of our board of directors.
preferred stock maa's charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 868,000 of which have been designated as 8.50% series i cumulative redeemable preferred stock, which we refer to as maa series i preferred stock. in addition to the maa series i preferred stock, the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any other series of preferred shares issued. the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of maa, even if a change in control were in maa shareholders' best interests. as of december 31, 2019, 867,846 shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding, all of which shares were maa series i preferred stock.
tennessee anti-takeover statutes as a tennessee corporation, maa is subject to various legislative acts, which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions. these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire maa and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if maa's acquisition would be in maa shareholders' best interests.
market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maa's common stock.
the market price of shares of common stock of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares, as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates. if market interest rates increase, prospective purchasers of maa's common stock may expect a higher annual distribution rate. higher interest rates would not, however, result in more funds for maa to distribute and, in fact, would likely increase maa's borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution. this could cause the market price of maa's common stock to go down. in addition, although maa's common stock is listed on the nyse, the daily trading volume of maa's common stock may be lower than the trading volume for companies in other industries. as a result, maa's investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of maa's common stock.
changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market's expectations with regard to our results of operations and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of maa's common stock.
we believe that the market value of a reit's equity securities is based primarily upon the market's perception of the reit's growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions, and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets. for that reason, maa's common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share. to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of maa's common stock. in addition, we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay distributions to maa's shareholders. our failure to meet the market's expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of maa's common stock.
the stock markets, including the nyse, on which maa lists its common stock, have, at times, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of maa's common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in maa's common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. among the market conditions that may affect the market price of maa's publicly traded securities are the following:
•   our financial condition and operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;

•   actual or anticipated differences in our quarterly and annual operating results;

•   changes in our revenues or earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;

•   publication of research reports about us or our industry by securities analysts;

17
•   additions and departures of key personnel;

•   inability to access the capital markets;

•   strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, dispositions, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;

•   the issuance of additional shares of maa's common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, including under maa's at-the-market share offering program, or atm program;

•   the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to ours;

•   the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies);

•   an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for maa's common stock;

•   the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry;

•   speculation in the press or investment community;

•   actions by institutional shareholders or hedge funds;

•   changes in accounting principles;

•   terrorist acts; and

•   general market conditions, including factors unrelated to our performance.

in the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources.
risks related to the operating partnership's organization and ownership of op units the operating partnership's existing unitholders have limited approval rights, which may prevent the operating partnership's sole general partner, maa, from completing a change of control transaction that may be in the best interests of all unitholders of the operating partnership and all shareholders of maa.
maa may not engage in a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership, dissolve the operating partnership or, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, take any action that would result in any unitholder realizing taxable gain, without the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding op units held by holders other than maa or its affiliates, or class a op units. the right of the holders of our class a op units to vote on these transactions could limit maa's ability to complete a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interest of all unitholders of the operating partnership and all shareholders of maa.
in certain circumstances, certain of the operating partnership's unitholders must approve the operating partnership's sale of certain properties contributed by the unitholders.
in certain circumstances, as detailed in the partnership agreement of the operating partnership, the operating partnership may not sell or otherwise transfer certain properties unless a specified percentage of the limited partners who were partners in the limited partnership holding such properties at the time of its acquisition by us approves such sale or transfer. the exercise of these approval rights by the operating partnership's unitholders could delay or prevent the operating partnership from completing a transaction that may be in the best interest of all unitholders of the operating partnership and all shareholders of maa.
maa, its officers and directors have substantial influence over the operating partnership's affairs.
maa, as the operating partnership's sole general partner and acting through its officers and directors, has a substantial influence on the operating partnership's affairs. maa, its officers and directors could exercise their influence in a manner that is not in the best interest of the unitholders of the operating partnership. also, maa owns approximately 96.6% of the op units and as such, will have substantial influence on the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to the operating partnership's unitholders for approval.
market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maa's common stock, which would affect the redemption price of the op units.
the market price of shares of common stock of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares, as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates. if market interest rates increase, prospective purchasers of maa's common stock may expect a higher annual distribution rate. higher interest rates would not, however, result in more funds for maa to distribute and, in fact, would likely increase maa's borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution. this could cause the market price of maa's common stock to go down, which would reduce the price received upon redemption of any op units, or if maa so elects, the value of maa's common stock received in lieu of cash upon redemption of such op units. in addition, although maa's common stock is listed on the nyse, the daily trading volume of maa's common stock may be lower than the trading volume for companies in other industries. as a result, maa's investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may
18
find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of maa's common stock.
insufficient cash flow from operations or a decline in the market price of maa's common stock may reduce the amount of cash available to the operating partnership to meet its obligations.
the operating partnership is subject to the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to make payments on its debt and to make distributions to its unitholders, which may cause maa to not have the funds to make distributions to its shareholders.  maa's failure to meet the market's expectations with regard to future results of operations and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of its shares and thus potentially reduce maa's ability to contribute funds from issuances down to the operating partnership, resulting in a lower level of cash available for investment, to make payments on its debt or to make distributions to its unitholders.
risks related to tax laws failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders.
if maa fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, maa will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits. in addition, unless maa is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, maa would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it loses its qualification. the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to maa's shareholders. maa's failure to qualify as a reit also could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital, and would adversely affect the value of maa's common stock.
maa believes that it is organized and qualified as a reit, and maa intends to operate in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify as a reit. maa cannot assure, however, that it is qualified or will remain qualified as a reit. this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within maa's control. in addition, future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of qualification as a reit.  even if maa qualifies as a reit, maa will be subject to various federal, state and local taxes, including property taxes and income taxes on taxable income that maa does not timely distribute to its shareholders. in addition, maa may hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly through its taxable reit subsidiaries, or trs, and those trs will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on their taxable income without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits.
furthermore, we have a subsidiary that has elected to be treated as a reit, and if our subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit, it is possible that we also would fail to qualify as a reit unless we (or the subsidiary reit) could qualify for certain relief provisions. the qualification of our subsidiary reit as a reit will depend on satisfaction, on an annual or quarterly basis, of numerous requirements set forth in highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. a determination as to whether such requirements are satisfied involves various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. the fact that we hold substantially all of our assets through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements for us. no assurance can be given that our subsidiary reit will qualify as a reit for any particular year.
if any reit previously acquired by us failed to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we would incur adverse tax consequences and our financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.
in the past, we have acquired companies that operated in a manner intended to allow them to qualify as  reits for u.s. federal income tax purposes. if any such reit previously acquired by maa, referred to as a merged reit, is determined to have lost its reit status at any time prior to its merger with maa, maa would be subject to serious adverse tax consequences, including:
•   maa would be required to pay u.s. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the taxable income of such merged reit without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction for the taxable years that the merged reit did not qualify as a reit and for which the statute of limitations period remains open; and

•   maa would be required to pay any federal alternative minimum tax liability of the merged reit and any applicable state and local tax liability, in each case, for all taxable years that remain open under the applicable statute of limitations periods.

maa is liable for any tax liability of a merged reit with respect to any periods prior to the merger of such merged reit with maa. if a merged reit failed to qualify as a reit, then in the event of a taxable disposition by maa of an asset previously
19
held by the merged reit during a specified period of up to 5 years following the merger of the merged reit with maa, maa will be subject to corporate income tax with respect to any built-in gain inherent in such asset as of the date of such merger. in addition, unless an applicable statutory relief provision applies, if a merged reit failed to qualify as a reit for a taxable year, then the merged reit would not have been entitled to re-elect to be taxed as a reit until the fifth taxable year following the year during which it was disqualified. furthermore, if both maa and a merged reit were "investment companies" under the "investment company" rules set forth in section 368 of the code at the time of the merger of maa and such merged reit, the failure of maa or such merged reit to have qualified as a reit at the time of their merger could result in such merger being treated as taxable for federal income tax purposes. as a result of all these factors, the failure by a merged reit to have qualified as a reit could jeopardize maa's qualification as a reit and require the operating partnership to provide material amounts of cash to maa to satisfy maa's additional tax liabilities and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on maa's business prospects, financial condition or results of operations and on maa's ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions.
the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
we believe that the operating partnership qualifies, and has so qualified since its formation, as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. no assurance can be provided, however, that the internal revenue service, or irs, will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates. in addition, the treatment of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause maa to fail to qualify as a reit. see "failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders" above.
certain dispositions of property by us may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a 100% penalty tax on any gain attributable to the disposition.
any gain resulting from a transfer of property that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated for federal income tax purposes as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property would be considered prohibited transactions. whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. as such, the irs may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes. a safe harbor to the characterization of the disposition of property as a prohibited transaction and the resulting imposition of the 100% tax is available; however, we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with such safe harbor in connection with any property dispositions.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of both maa and the operating partnership, of which maa is the sole general partner and in which maa owned a 96.6% interest as of december 31, 2019. maa conducts all of its business through the operating partnership and its various subsidiaries.  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
maa, an s&p 500 company, is a multifamily-focused, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or reit. we own, operate, acquire and selectively develop apartment communities primarily located in the southeast, southwest and mid-atlantic regions of the united states. as of december 31, 2019, we owned and operated 299 apartment communities through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries, and we had an ownership interest in one apartment community through an unconsolidated real estate joint venture and had seven development communities under construction. in addition, as of december 31, 2019, we owned four commercial properties, and 32 of our apartment communities included retail components. our apartment communities and commercial properties are located across 16 states and the district of columbia.
we report in two segments, same store and non-same store and other.  our same store segment represents those apartment communities that have been owned and stabilized for at least 12 months as of the first day of the calendar year. our non-same store and other segment includes recently acquired communities, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities undergoing extensive renovations, communities identified for disposition and communities that have incurred a significant casualty loss. also included in our non-same store and other segment are non-multifamily activities.  additional information regarding the composition of our segments is included in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
overview for the year ended december 31, 2019, net income available for maa common shareholders was $350.1 million as compared to $219.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018.  results for the year ended december 31, 2019 included $17.9 million of income related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the maa series i preferred shares and $93.0 million of gains related to the sale of real estate assets.  results for the year ended december 31, 2018 included $2.6 million of
26
expense related to the adjustment of the embedded derivative and $4.5 million of gains related to the sale of real estate assets.  revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased 4.4% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, driven by a 3.4% increase in our same store segment and an 18.5% increase in our non-same store and other segment. property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased by 3.1% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, driven by a 2.9% increase in our same store segment and a 5.5% increase in our non-same store and other segment. the drivers of these increases are discussed below in the "results of operations" section.
over the past three years, our growth has partially been driven by our acquisition and development strategy to invest in growing markets in the southeast, southwest and mid-atlantic regions of the united states. we acquired one apartment community in 2019, one in 2018, and two in 2017.  five apartment communities were disposed in 2019 and five apartment communities were disposed in 2017. no apartment communities were disposed in 2018.  two multifamily development projects were completed in 2019, three in 2018 and seven in 2017.
trends during the year ended december 31, 2019, we were favorably impacted by rent pricing growth throughout the year.  average effective rent per unit for the same store portfolio continued to increase, up 3.6% for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.  average daily physical occupancy for our same store portfolio was 95.9% for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared with the average daily physical occupancy of 96.1% achieved during the year ended december 31, 2018.
an important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain diversity of markets, submarkets, product types and price points in the southeast, southwest and mid-atlantic regions of the united states. this diversity tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area. we believe that a well-balanced portfolio, including inner loop, suburban and downtown/central business district locations, with various monthly rent price points, will perform well in "up" cycles as well as weather "down" cycles better. through our investment in 36 defined markets, we are diversified across markets, urban and suburban submarkets and a variety of product types and monthly rent pricing points.
though overall demand continues to be strong, the current elevated supply levels are impacting rent growth for our portfolio, particularly for apartment communities located in urban submarkets. properties in suburban submarkets have been impacted somewhat less by supply, primarily because less new development has occurred in those submarkets. multifamily permitting is typically a leading indicator of future supply levels. multifamily permitting across our markets was up in 2018 as compared to 2017, and the u.s. census bureau's data for 2019 suggested multifamily permitting across our markets was up as compared to 2018.  it is difficult to project supply levels based on this data because not all permitted projects are ultimately built.  however, given the current supply level and the 2019 permitting data, we believe that supply in some of our markets could remain elevated over the next couple of years.
demand for our apartments is primarily driven by general economic conditions in our markets. in particular, job growth relative to new supply is a critical factor in our ability to maintain occupancy and increase rents. to the extent that economic conditions continue to support increased job growth, we believe that we may be able to maintain solid occupancy and more effectively increase rents. we also believe that the existing disciplined credit terms for residential mortgages should continue to favor rental demand at multifamily apartment communities. furthermore, rental competition from single family homes has not historically been a major competitive factor impacting our portfolio. we have seen significant rental competition from single family homes in only a few of our submarkets.  for the year ended december 31, 2019, total move outs attributable to single family home rentals for our combined portfolio represented less than 6% of total move outs, down from approximately 7% for the year ended december 31, 2018.  long term, we expect demographic trends (including the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the southeast, southwest and mid-atlantic regions) will continue to support apartment rental demand in our markets.
changing interest rates may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.  as of december 31, 2019, we had approximately $4.5 billion of debt, of which 2% had variable rate interest and 98% had fixed or hedged interest rates.  to the extent interest rates rise, our net interest expense on variable rate debt will increase as will potentially our net interest expense on any debt refinancing.  the opposite is true should interest rates decrease.  given the short-term nature of our leases, to the extent interest rates rise due to general economic growth, we would expect increases in interest expense to be somewhat offset by positive leasing trends.
our focus is on maintaining strong physical occupancy while increasing pricing where possible through our revenue management system. as noted above, average daily physical occupancy for our same store portfolio for the year ended december 31, 2019 was 95.9%.  as we continue through the typically slower winter leasing season, we believe that the current level of physical occupancy and continued strong job growth in our markets position us well for this period and sets us up to achieve continued pricing growth in 2020.
27
results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2019, we achieved net income available for maa common shareholders of $350.1 million, a 59.7% increase as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, and total revenue growth of $69.7 million, representing a 4.4% increase in property revenues as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.  the following discussion describes the primary drivers of the increase in net income available for maa common shareholders for the year ended december 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.  a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2017 is found in item 7 of part ii of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018, filed with the sec on february 21, 2019, which is available free of charge on the sec's website at www.sec.gov and on our website at https://www.maac.com, on the "for investors" page under "filings and financials-annual reports".

the increase in property revenues for our same store segment for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018 was the primary driver of total property revenue growth.  the same store segment generated a 3.4% increase in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily a result of average effective rent per unit growth of 3.6% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.  the increase in property revenues from the non-same store and other segment for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily the result of continued lease-up of our development communities.
property operating expenses property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other operating expenses. the following table reflects our property operating expenses by segment for the years ended december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):

the increase in property operating expenses for our same store segment for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in real estate tax expense of $10.0 million. the increase in property operating expenses from our non-same store and other segment was driven by an increase in real estate tax expense, primarily due to the recent completion of apartment communities previously in our development pipeline.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31, 2019 was $496.8 million, an increase of $7.1 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.  the increase was primarily driven by the recognition of depreciation expense associated with our development and redevelopment activities made in the normal course of business during the year ended december 31, 2019.
other income and expenses property management expenses for the year ended december 31, 2019 were $55.0 million, an increase of $7.4 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was primarily due to increases in personnel and technology costs. general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2019 were $46.1 million, an increase of $11.3 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily due to increases in personnel and legal costs. no merger and integration expenses were incurred during the year ended december 31, 2019, which represented a decrease of $9.1 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.
interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2019 was $179.8 million, an increase of $6.3 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately 14 basis points in our effective
28
interest rate during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.  the increase in the effective interest rate was primarily due to the recent maturity of debt we assumed in previous corporate acquisitions.
for the year ended december 31, 2019, we disposed of five apartment communities, resulting in gains on sale of depreciable real estate assets of $81.0 million.  we did not dispose of any apartment communities during the year ended december 31, 2018.  the gain on sale of non-depreciable assets for the year ended december 31, 2019 was $12.0 million, an increase of $7.5 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.  although annual land disposition volume remained consistent year-over-year, the gain on sale of non-depreciable assets increased primarily due to the nature of the real estate assets sold.
other non-operating income for the year ended december 31, 2019 was $25.3 million, an increase of $19.8 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.  the increase was primarily due to the recognition of $17.9 million of income related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the maa series i preferred shares during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the recognition of $2.6 million of expense related to the adjustment of the embedded derivative during the year ended december 31, 2018.
funds from operations funds from operations, or ffo, a non-gaap financial measure, represents net income available for maa common shareholders (computed in accordance with the united states generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap) excluding gains or losses on disposition of operating properties and asset impairment, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and adjustments for joint ventures. because noncontrolling interest is added back, ffo, when used in this annual report on form 10-k, represents ffo attributable to the company.
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income available for maa common stockholders or any other gaap measurement, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity.  management believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance, primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets. we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. while our calculation of ffo is in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts', or nareit's, definition, it may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits.
the following table presents a reconciliation of net income available for maa common shareholders to ffo for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, as we believe net income available for maa common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure (dollars in thousands):

ffo for the year ended december 31, 2019 was $773.2 million, an increase of $60.5 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily as a result of increases in property revenues of $69.7 million, other non-operating income of $19.8 million and gain on sale of non-depreciable assets of $7.5 million, in addition to a decrease in merger and integration expenses of $9.1 million.   the increases to ffo were offset by increases in property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, of $18.3 million, general and administrative expenses of $11.3 million, property management expenses of $7.4 million and interest expense of $6.3 million.
liquidity and capital resources our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as well as general economic and market conditions, are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources.
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $781.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to $734.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2018.  the increase in operating cash flows was primarily driven by our operating performance, partially offset by the timing of cash payments.

the decrease in cash outflows for purchases of real estate and other assets was driven by the acquisition activity during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.  the increase in cash outflows for capital improvements, development and other as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by increased development capital spend during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in cash inflows related to proceeds from disposition of real estate assets was primarily due to the sale of five apartment communities and four land parcels during the year ended december 31, 2019, as compared to the sale of four land parcels during the year ended december 31, 2018.  no apartment communities were sold during the year ended december 31, 2018.

the increase in cash outflows related to the net change in credit lines resulted from the decrease in net borrowings of $540.0 million on our unsecured revolving credit facility during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the increase in net borrowings of $50.0 million on the unsecured revolving credit facility during the year ended december 31, 2018.  the increase in cash inflows related to the net change in commercial paper resulted from the initiation of an unsecured commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2019; there was no commercial paper program in place during the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in cash inflows related to proceeds from notes payable primarily resulted from the issuance of $850.0 million of senior unsecured notes and $191.3 million of secured property mortgages during the year ended december 31, 2019, as compared to the issuance of $400.0 million of senior unsecured notes, $172.0 million of secured property mortgages and a $300.0 million unsecured term loan during the year ended december 31, 2018. the decrease in cash outflows from principal payments on notes payable primarily resulted from the retirement of $600.0 million in unsecured term loans, the retirement of a $20.0 million tranche of senior unsecured notes and the retirement of $30.4 million of secured property mortgages during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the retirement of $568.0 million of secured property mortgages, the retirement of a $250.0 million unsecured term loan and the retirement of a $50.0 million tranche of senior unsecured notes during the year ended december 31, 2018.  the increase in cash outflows from dividends paid on common shares primarily resulted from the increase in the annual dividend rate to $3.84 per share during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the annual dividend rate of $3.69 per share during the year ended december 31, 2018.
equity as of december 31, 2019, maa owned 114,246,393 op units, comprising a 96.6% limited partnership interest in maalp, while the remaining 4,067,174 outstanding op units were held by limited partners of maalp other than maa.  holders of op units (other than maa) may require us to redeem their op units from time to time, in which case maa may, at its option, pay the redemption price either in cash (in an amount per op unit equal, in general, to the average closing price of maa's common stock on the nyse over a specified period prior to the redemption date) or by delivering one share of maa's common stock (subject to adjustment under specified circumstances) for each op unit so redeemed.  in addition, maa has registered under the securities act 4,067,174 shares of its common stock that, as of december 31, 2019, were issuable upon redemption of op units, in order for those shares to be sold freely in the public markets.

we have entered into separate distribution agreements with each of j.p. morgan securities llc, bmo capital markets corp. and keybanc capital markets inc. to establish an atm program allowing maa to sell shares of its common stock from time to time into the existing market at current market prices or through negotiated transactions.  under the atm program, maa has the authority to issue up to an aggregate of 4.0 million shares of its common stock, at such times to be determined by maa.  the atm program currently has a maturity of september 28, 2021.  maa has no obligation to issue shares through the atm program.
during the year ended december 31, 2019, maa sold 146,301 shares of common stock for net and gross proceeds of $19.6 million and $19.9 million, respectively, through its atm program, all of which shares were sold during the three months ended december 31, 2019.  during the year ended december 31, 2018, maa did not sell any shares of common stock under its atm program. as of december 31, 2019, there were 3.9 million shares remaining under the atm program.

unsecured revolving credit facility & commercial paper in may 2019, the operating partnership entered into a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by wells fargo bank, national association, or wells fargo, and fifteen other banks, which we refer to as the credit facility.  the credit facility replaced our previous unsecured revolving credit facility and includes an expansion option up to $1.5 billion.  the credit facility bears an interest rate of libor, plus a spread of 0.75% to 1.45% based on an investment grade pricing grid.  the credit facility matures in may 2023 with an option to extend for two additional six-month periods.  as of december 31, 2019, there was no outstanding balance under the credit facility, while $2.7 million of capacity was being used to support outstanding letters of credit.
in may 2019, the operating partnership established an unsecured commercial paper program, whereby the operating partnership may issue unsecured commercial paper notes with varying maturities not to exceed 397 days up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of $500.0 million. as of december 31, 2019, the operating partnership had $70.0 million outstanding under the commercial paper program. during the year ended december 31, 2019, our average daily borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program were $211.7 million.  the commercial paper program along with the credit facility serve as our primary sources of short-term liquidity.
senior unsecured notes as of december 31, 2019, we had $3.3 billion, in principal amount of publicly issued senior unsecured notes outstanding.  in march 2019, the operating partnership publicly issued $300.0 million of senior unsecured notes due march 2029 with a coupon of 3.950%, paid semi-annually on march 15 and september 15, and an effective interest rate of 4.240%, net of swap agreements.  in august 2019, the operating partnership publicly issued an additional $250.0 million of senior unsecured notes due march 2029 with a coupon of 3.950%, paid semi-annually on march 15 and september 15, and an effective interest rate of 2.985%.  in november 2019, the operating partnership publicly issued $300.0 million of senior unsecured notes due march 2030 with a coupon of 2.750%, paid semi-annually on march 15 and september 15, and an effective interest rate of 3.065%, net of swap agreements.  the proceeds from the senior unsecured notes issued in march 2019 were used to pay down outstanding amounts under our previous unsecured revolving credit facility, and the proceeds from the senior unsecured notes issued in august 2019 and november 2019 were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.
as of december 31, 2019, we also had $222.0 million outstanding of senior unsecured notes issued in two private placement offerings.  a $20.0 million tranche with an interest rate of 3.61% was retired in november 2019 on its maturity date.
unsecured term loans as of december 31, 2019, we maintained one term loan with a syndicate of banks, led by wells fargo.  the term loan has a balance of $300.0 million, matures in 2022, and has a variable interest rate of libor plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.75% based on the company's credit ratings.  the interest rate of the term loan is fixed at 2.32% with interest rate swaps that mature in january 2020.
in may 2019, we retired a $300.0 million term loan with wells fargo, which was due in june 2019.
in august 2019, we retired a $150.0 million term loan with u.s. bank national association, which was due in march 2020.

(2)   swapped interest is subject to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges as described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.

(3)   interest payments on variable rate debt instruments not subject to interest rate swaps are based on each debt instrument's respective interest rate as of december 31, 2019, which is assumed to be in effect through the maturity date of the respective debt instrument.

(4)   primarily comprised of a ground lease underlying one apartment community we own and the lease of our corporate headquarters.

we have a commitment, which is not reflected in the table above, to make additional capital contributions to a limited partnership in which we hold an equity interest.  the capital contributions may be called by the general partner at any time until september 2022 after giving appropriate notice. as of december 31, 2019, we had committed to make additional capital contributions totaling up to $8.2 million if and when called by the general partner of the limited partnership and until september 2022.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, we had an ownership interest in a limited liability company, which owns one apartment community comprised of 269 units, located in washington, d.c. we also had an ownership interest in a limited partnership as of december 31, 2019. our interests in these investments are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method as we do not have a controlling interest.
as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, we did not have any relationships, including those with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.  in addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. as such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. we do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
insurance we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our apartment communities, with limits of liability we believe are customary within the multifamily apartment industry, to insure against liability claims and related defense costs.  we also maintain insurance against the risk of direct physical damage to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild any property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.
we renegotiated our insurance programs effective july 1, 2019. we believe that the current property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operations.
inflation our resident leases at our apartment communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder, and thus may enable us to seek rent increases.  the majority of our leases are for one year or less. the short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation.

critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty.  the preceding discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap.  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances.  we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
we believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical.
acquisition of real estate assets we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate as asset acquisitions in accordance with  accounting standards update 2017-01, business combinations (topic 805): clarifying the definition of a business, which requires the cost of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the individual acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings and improvements and other, and identified intangible assets, consisting of the value of in-place leases and other contracts, on a relative fair value basis. in calculating the total asset value of acquired tangible assets, management uses stabilized net operating income, or noi, and market specific capitalization and discount rates. management analyzes historical stabilized noi to determine its estimate for forecasted noi. management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets. management then allocates the purchase price of the asset acquisition based on the relative fair value of the individual components as a proportion of the total assets acquired.
impairment of long-lived assets we account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. management periodically evaluates long-lived assets, including investments in real estate, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions and legal factors.  long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, which is estimated by analyzing historical cash flows of the asset.  if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.  management calculates the fair value of an asset by dividing projected cash flows based on historical operating cash flows by a market capitalization rate.  management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets.  no material impairment losses were recognized during the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018.
cost capitalization in conformity with gaap, we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset. expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred. therefore, repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations and replacements are capitalized. the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred. the carrying costs related to development projects, including interest, property taxes, insurance and allocated direct development salary costs during the construction period, are capitalized. management uses judgment in determining whether costs should be expensed or capitalized.
loss contingencies the outcomes of claims, disputes and legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty. management records an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. we also accrue an estimate of defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with legal matters. management reviews these accruals quarterly and makes revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. when a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, then we do not accrue the loss. however, for material loss contingencies, if the unrecorded loss (or an additional loss in excess of the accrual) is at least a reasonable possibility and material, then management discloses a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, if such reasonable estimate can be made. if we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, then a statement to that effect is disclosed.
34
the assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. among the factors that we consider in this assessment, including with respect to the matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10-k, are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if reasonably estimable), the progress of the matter, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in similar matters, the facts available to us at the time of assessment, and how we intend to respond, or have responded, to the proceeding or claim.  management's assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress. for matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate; (ii) the proceedings are in the early stages; (iii) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties; and/or (iv) discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss, or range of loss, can be made. in such instances, management believes that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss or business impact, if any.
valuation of embedded derivative the redemption feature embedded in the maa series i preferred stock is reported as a derivative asset and is adjusted to its fair value at each reporting date, with a corresponding non-cash adjustment to the income statement.  the derivative asset related to the redemption feature is valued using widely accepted valuation techniques, including a discounted cash flow analysis in which the perpetual value of the preferred shares is compared to the value of the preferred shares assuming the call option is exercised, with the value of the bifurcated call option as the difference between the two values. the analysis reflects the contractual terms of the redeemable preferred shares, which are redeemable at our option beginning on october 1, 2026 and at the redemption price of $50 per share. we use various inputs in the analysis, including trading data available on the preferred shares, coupon yields on preferred stock issuances from reits with similar credit ratings as maa and treasury rates to determine the fair value of the bifurcated call option.
for more information regarding our significant accounting policies, including a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements that could have a material impact on our financial statements, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.

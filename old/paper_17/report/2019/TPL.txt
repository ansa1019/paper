item 1a. risk factors.
an investment in our securities involves a degree of risk. the risks described below are not the only ones facing us. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on us. if any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or business could be harmed. in that case, the market price of our securities could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.
global economic conditions may materially and adversely affect our business.
our business and results of operations are affected by international, national and regional economic conditions. a recurrence of recessionary conditions in the united states and elsewhere may lead to reduced industrial production which, in turn, may lead to lower demand and lower prices for oil and gas, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
we face the risks of doing business in a new and rapidly evolving market and may not be able to successfully address such risks and achieve acceptable levels of success or profits.
we have encountered and may continue to encounter the challenges, uncertainties and difficulties frequently experienced in new and rapidly evolving markets with respect to the business of tpwr, including:
•limited operating experience;
•start-up costs for a new line of business;
•lack of sufficient customers or loss of significant customers for the new line of business; and
•difficulties in managing potentially rapid growth.
the trust's oil and gas royalty revenue is dependent upon the market prices of oil and gas which fluctuate.
the oil and gas royalties which the trust receives are dependent upon the market prices for oil and gas. the market prices for oil and gas are subject to national and international economic and political conditions and, in the past, have been subject to significant price fluctuations. price fluctuations for oil and gas have been particularly volatile in recent years. when lower market prices for oil and gas occur, they will have an adverse effect on our oil and gas royalty revenues.
the trust is not an oil and gas producer. its revenues from oil and gas royalties are subject to the actions of others.
the trust is not an oil and gas producer. its oil and gas income is derived primarily from perpetual non-participating oil and gas royalty interests which it has retained. as oil and gas wells age, the costs of production may increase and their capacity may decline absent additional investment. however, the owners and operators of the oil and gas wells make all decisions as to investments in, and production from, those wells and the trust's royalties are dependent upon decisions made by those operators, among other factors. the railroad commission of the state of texas sets authorized production levels for pro-rated wells by regulation. in the past, the trust's income from oil and gas royalties has been limited by the production levels authorized by the railroad commission and we cannot assure you that they may not be so limited in the future. accordingly, a significant portion of our revenues is reliant on the management of third parties, over whom we have no control. there can be no assurance that such third parties will take actions or make decisions that will be beneficial to the trust, which could result in adverse effects on our financial results and performance.
our revenues from the sale of land are subject to substantial fluctuation. land sales are subject to many factors that are beyond our control.
land sales vary widely from year to year and quarter to quarter. the total dollar amount, the average price per acre, and the number of acres sold in any one year or quarter should not be assumed to be indicative of future land sales. the demand for, and the sale price of, any particular tract of the trust's land is influenced by many factors, including the national and local economies, rate of oil and gas well development by operators, the rate of residential and commercial development in nearby areas, livestock carrying capacity and the condition of the local agricultural industry, which itself is influenced by range conditions and prices for livestock and agricultural products. the trust's ability to sell land is, therefore, largely dependent on the actions of adjoining landowners.
the impact of government regulation on tpwr could adversely affect our business.
the business of tpwr is subject to applicable state and federal laws and regulations, including laws and regulations on environmental and safety matters. these laws and regulations may increase the costs and timing of planning, designing, drilling, installing, operating and abandoning water wells and treatment facilities. tpwr's business could be affected by problems, slowdowns or other stoppages to operations of providing water treatment critical to the success of tpwr.
the loss of key members of our management team, or difficulty attracting and retaining experienced technical personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and prospects for future success.
the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of other issues integral to our future success will depend, in part, on our experienced management team, including with respect to the business of tpwr. the loss of key members of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. if we cannot retain our experienced personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.
if the liability of holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares were to be found to be governed by the laws of texas, holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares might be held to have personal liability for claims against the trust, to the extent such claims exceeded the assets of the trust.
the declaration of trust, which established the trust, was executed and delivered in new york. under the laws of the state of new york, the holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares are not subject to any personal liability for the acts or obligations of the trust. the assets of the trust are located in texas. under the laws of the state of texas, the holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares may be held personally liable with respect to claims against the trust, but only after the assets of the trust first have been exhausted. thus, if a court were to hold that the liability of holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares for obligations is governed by the laws of texas, rather than new york, it is possible that holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares might be held to have personal liability for claims against the trust to the extent such claims exceeded all of the trust's assets.
the trustees are not subject to annual election and, as a result, the ability of the holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares to influence the policies of the trust may be limited.
directors of a corporation are generally subject to election at each annual meeting of stockholders or, in the case of staggered boards, at regular intervals. under the declaration of trust, however, the trust is not required to hold annual meetings of holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares to elect trustees and trustees generally hold office until their death, resignation or disqualification. as a result, the ability of holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares to effect changes in the board of trustees, and the policies of the trust, is significantly more limited than that of the stockholders of a corporation.
our results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for a full year.
revenues from oil and gas royalties may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon market prices for oil and gas and production decisions made by the operators. our other revenue streams, which include, but are not limited to, water sales and royalties, easements and other surface-related income and sales of land, may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter. as a result, the results of our operations for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year.
any governance or structural changes to the trust could adversely affect the trading price and/or form of our certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares.
our trustees formed a conversion exploration committee (the "committee") in june 2019 to evaluate, from a corporate, corporate governance, tax, accounting and business perspective, whether the trust should be converted into a c-corporation or, in the alternative, whether the trust should remain a business trust (with potential amendments to the trust's declaration of trust). the committee has made a non-binding recommendation to the trustees that the trust be converted into a delaware c-corporation, and that such conversion be done in a certain way. there can be no assurance when any structural or governance change, if any, would be made that would affect the securities held by our sub-shareholders, our governance or our declaration of trust and how our sub-shareholders and investors may view any such structural or governance change. there can be no assurance of the terms of such changes, if any, or their effect on our securities or their trading price. the trading price of our securities may be adversely affected by any decision of the trustees to convert the trust to a c-corporation or to remain as a trust.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion and analysis should be read together with the factors discussed in item 1a "risk factors" and with the consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. period-to-period comparisons of financial data are not necessarily indicative, and therefore should not be relied upon as indicators, of the trust's future performance. words or phrases such as "does not believe" and "believes," or similar expressions, when used in this form 10-k or other filings with the sec, are intended to identify "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
overview the trust was organized in 1888 and holds title to extensive tracts of land in numerous counties in west texas which were previously the property of the texas and pacific railway company. we continue to manage those lands for the benefit of the holders of certificates of proprietary interest in the trust (and/or sub-shares).
our revenues are derived primarily from oil and gas royalties, sales of water and land, easements and commercial leases. due to the nature of our operations, our revenue is subject to substantial fluctuations from quarter to quarter and year to year. the demand for, and sale price of, particular tracts of land is influenced by many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the rate of development in nearby areas and the suitability of the particular tract for commercial uses prevalent in western texas.
we are not an oil and gas producer. rather, our oil and gas revenue is derived from our oil and gas royalty interests. thus, in addition to being subject to fluctuations in response to the market prices for oil and gas, our oil and gas royalty revenues are also subject to decisions made by the owners and operators of the oil and gas wells to which our royalty interests relate as to investments in and production from those wells. we monitor reports from the operators, the texas railroad commission, and other private data providers to assure that we are being paid the appropriate royalties.
our revenue from easements is primarily generated from pipelines transporting oil, gas and related hydrocarbons, power line and utility easements, and subsurface wellbore easements. the majority of our easements have a thirty-plus year term but subsequently renew every ten years with an additional payment. commercial lease revenue is derived primarily from saltwater disposal royalties, processing, storage and compression facilities and roads.
tpwr focuses on providing full-service water offerings to operators in the permian basin. these services include, but are not limited to, water sourcing, produced-water gathering/treatment, infrastructure development, disposal solutions, water tracking, analytics and well testing services. tpwr's revenue streams principally consist of revenue generated from sales of sourced and treated water as well as revenues from produced water royalties.
results of operations we operate our business in two segments: land and resource management and water services and operations. we eliminate any inter-segment revenues and expenses upon consolidation.
we analyze financial results for each of our reportable segments. the reportable segments presented are consistent with our reportable segments discussed in note 10, "business segment reporting" in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10-k. we monitor our reporting segments based upon revenue and net income calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap").
year ended december 31, 2019 compared to year ended december 31, 2018
revenues. revenues increased $190.3 million, or 63.4% to $490.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $300.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. net income increased $109.0 million, or 52.0%, to $318.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $209.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018.

land and resource management land and resource management segment revenues increased $151.9 million, or 71.8%, to $363.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared with revenues of $211.5 million for the comparable period of 2018.
oil and gas royalties. oil and gas royalty revenue was $154.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $123.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, an increase of 24.9%. oil royalty revenue was $128.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $94.6 million for the comparable period of 2018. this increase in oil royalty revenue is principally due to the effect of a 48.3% increase in crude oil production subject to the trust's royalty interest partially offset by a 8.0% decrease in the average price per royalty barrel of crude oil received during the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. gas royalty revenue was $26.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, a decrease of 10.9% over the year ended december 31, 2018 when gas royalty revenue was $29.2 million. this decrease in gas royalty revenue resulted from a 49.3% decrease in the average price received for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018, partially offset by a volume increase of 89.3% over the same time period.
easements and other surface-related income. easements and other surface-related income was $73.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of 14.5% compared to $63.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. easements and other surface-related income includes pipeline, power line and utility easements, commercial leases, material sales and seismic and temporary permits. the increase in easements and other surface-related income is principally related to increases of $4.6 million in pipeline easement income and $3.5 million in commercial lease revenue for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018. easements and other surface-related income is unpredictable and may vary significantly from period to period.
sale of oil and gas royalty interests. there were no sales of oil and gas royalty interests for the year ended december 31, 2019. revenue from the sale of oil and gas royalty interests was $18.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, when the trust sold nonparticipating perpetual royalty interests in approximately 812 net royalty acres for an average price of approximately $23,234 per net royalty acre.
land sales and other operating revenue. land sales and other operating revenue includes revenue generated from land sales and grazing leases. for the year ended december 31, 2019, we sold approximately 21,986 acres of land for total consideration of $113.0 million, or approximately $5,141 per acre. additionally, the trust conveyed approximately 5,620 acres of land in exchange for approximately 5,545 acres of land, all in culberson county. as we had no cost basis in the land conveyed, we recognized land sales revenue of $22.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. for the year ended december 31, 2018, land sales generated $4.4 million of income for selling approximately 171 acres at an average price of $25,464 per acre.
net income. net income for the land and resource management segment was $258.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $159.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. as discussed above, revenues for the land and resource management segment increased $151.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018. expenses, including income tax expense, for the land and resource management segment were $105.0 million and $51.9 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the increase in expenses was principally related to increased income tax expense associated with the $130.7 million increase in land sales revenue, resulting in additional income tax expense of approximately $27.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018. through §1031 exchanges, income tax expense of approximately $19.8 million was eligible for deferral for the year ended december 31, 2019. the remaining increase was principally related to increased legal and professional fees and salaries and related employee expenses. see further discussion of these expenses below under "other financial data - consolidated."
water services and operations water services and operations segment revenues increased $38.4 million, or 43.3%, to $127.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared with revenues of $88.7 million for the comparable period of 2018.
water sales and royalties. water sales and royalty revenue was $85.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of 32.9% compared with the year ended december 31, 2018 when water sales and royalty revenue was $63.9 million. this increase was principally due to a 44.0% increase in the number of barrels of sourced and treated water sold during the year ended december 31, 2019 over the same period in 2018, partially offset by decreased water royalties.
easements and other surface-related income. easements and other surface-related income for the water services and operations segment includes pipeline easement royalties, commercial lease royalties and income from temporary permits. for the year ended december 31, 2019, the combined revenue from these revenue streams was $42.2 million as compared to $24.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in easements and other surface-related income was principally related to an increase of $21.5 million in produced water royalties for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018, partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease in temporary permit income over the same time period.
net income. net income for the water services and operations segment was $60.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $50.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. as discussed above, revenues for the water services and operations segment increased $38.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018. expenses, including income tax expense, for the water services and operations segment were $66.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to $38.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in expenses during 2019 is primarily related to increased water service-related operating expenses, principally fuel, repairs and maintenance and equipment rental related to sourcing and transfer of water. the remaining increase was principally related to increased salaries and related employee expenses as discussed further below under "other financial data - consolidated."
other financial data - consolidated salaries and related employee expenses. salaries and related employee expenses were $35.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $18.4 million for the comparable period of 2018. the increase in salaries and related employee expenses is directly related to the increase in the number of employees from 64 employees as of december 31, 2018 to 94 as of december 31, 2019 as well as additional contract labor expenses over the same time period.
water service-related expenses. water service-related expenses were $20.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $11.2 million for the same period of 2018. this increase in expenses was principally the result of an increase in fuel and repairs and maintenance expenses to source and transfer water and is directly related to the 44.0% sales increase in the number of barrels of sourced and treated water sold as previously discussed.
general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased $5.1 million to $9.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 from $4.7 million for the same period of 2018. the increase in general and administrative expenses is principally related to increased expenses associated with our independent contractor service providers, computer-related software and services, and additional liability insurance.
legal and professional expenses. legal and professional fees increased $13.9 million to $16.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 from $2.5 million for the comparable period of 2018. the increase in legal and professional fees for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to 2018 is principally due to approximately $13.0 million of legal and professional fees related to the proxy contest to elect a new trustee, the entry into and payments made under the settlement agreement dated july 30, 2019 and the conversion exploration committee as disclosed in the trust's current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on july 30, 2019. we anticipate receiving a partial reimbursement of these legal and professional fees under coverage provided by our director and officer insurance policy. the amount of the reimbursement has not yet been determined.
depreciation, depletion and amortization. depreciation, depletion and amortization was $8.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $2.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization is principally related to the trust's investment in water service-related assets placed in service in 2019 and the latter half of 2018 and to a lesser extent, additional depreciation expense related to the change in estimated useful lives of certain water service-related assets as discussed in note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies - change in accounting estimate."
year ended december 31, 2018 compared to year ended december 31, 2017
revenues. revenues increased $145.6 million, or 94.1%, to $300.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $154.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. net income increased $112.5 million, or 115.7% to $209.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $97.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017.

land and resource management land and resource management segment revenues increased $88.1 million, or 71.5%, to $211.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared with revenues of $123.3 million for the comparable period of 2017.
oil and gas royalties. oil and gas royalty revenue was $123.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $58.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of 112.0%. oil royalty revenue was $94.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $36.9 million for the comparable period of 2017. this increase in oil royalty revenue is principally due to the combined effect of a 110.0% increase in crude oil production, subject to the trust's royalty interest, and a 21.6% increase in the average price per royalty barrel of crude oil received during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. gas royalty revenue was $29.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, an increase of 111.4% over the year ended december 31, 2017 when gas royalty revenue was $13.8 million. this increase in gas royalty revenue resulted from a volume increase of 178.5% for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the same period of 2017, partially offset by a 24.2% decrease in the average price received. additionally, oil and gas royalties for the year ended december 31, 2017 included $7.7 million related to the settlement of an arbitration with chevron u.s.a., inc. in september 2017. no such settlement was received for the year ended december 31, 2018.
easements and other surface-related income. easements and other surface-related income was $63.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, a slight decrease compared to $64.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. easements and other surface-related income includes pipeline easement income, seismic and temporary permit income, lease rental income and income from material sales. easements and other surface-related income is unpredictable and may vary significantly from period to period. the slight decrease in easements and other surface-related income is principally related to a decrease in material sales, partially offset by an increase in pipeline easement income. material sales decreased 22.3% to $5.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the same period of 2017. pipeline easement income increased 3.7% to $43.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. effective january 1, 2018, upon the trust's adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, we no longer defer revenue on our term easements.
sale of oil and gas royalty interests. revenue from the sale of oil and gas royalty interests was $18.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the trust sold nonparticipating perpetual royalty interests in approximately 812 net royalty acres for an average price of approximately $23,234 per net royalty acre.

net income. net income for the land and resource management segment was $159.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $78.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. as discussed above, revenues for the land and resource management segment increased $88.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the same period of 2017. expenses for the land and resource management segment were $51.9 million and $44.9 million for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the increase in expenses was principally related to increased salary expense and general and administrative expenses. see further discussion of these expenses below under "other financial data - consolidated."
water services and operations water services and operations segment revenues increased $57.4 million, or 183.6%, to $88.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared with revenues of $31.3 million for the comparable period of 2017.
water sales and royalties. water sales and royalty revenue for the year ended december 31, 2018 of $63.9 million was more than double the amount of revenue for the comparable period of 2017. this increase is due primarily to the trust commencing the development of water sourcing, partially offset by a decrease in the royalties received from existing legacy agreements.

other financial data - consolidated salaries and related employee expenses. salaries and related employee expenses were $18.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $3.8 million for the comparable period of 2017. the increase in salaries and related employee expenses is directly related to the increase in the number of employees from 26 employees as of december 31, 2017 to 64 as of december 31, 2018 as well as an increase in contract labor expenses over the same time period.
water service-related expenses. water service-related expenses of $11.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, include expenses for equipment rental, propane and fuel and other equipment-related expenses associated with water sourcing and water re-use projects placed in service in 2018 and late 2017. the trust incurred only minimal water service-related expenses during the year ended december 31, 2017.
general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased $3.2 million to $4.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from $1.5 million for the same period of 2017. the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to additional liability insurance and equipment costs as a result of the formation and commencement of operations of tpwr during the second quarter of 2017.

depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization was $2.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $0.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in depreciation and amortization is principally related to the trust's investment in water service-related assets during 2017 and 2018.
cash flow analysis year ended december 31, 2019 compared to year ended december 31, 2018
cash flows provided by operating activities for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 were $342.8 million and $195.4 million, respectively. this increase in operating cash flows is principally due to increases in proceeds from land sales, oil and gas royalties, easements and other surface-related payments received and water sales and royalties during the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.
cash flows used in investing activities were $111.7 million compared to $81.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the increased use of investing cash flows is principally due to our acquisition of approximately 21,671 acres of land in culberson, glassock, loving and reeves counties, texas for approximately $74.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2019. this increase was partially offset by a $19.3 million decrease in acquisitions of royalty interests and a $15.7 million reduction in capital expenditures during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018.

liquidity and capital resources the trust's principal sources of liquidity are its revenues from oil and gas royalties, easements and other surface-related income, and water and land sales.
our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for capital expenditures related to our water services and operations segment, working capital and general corporate needs. as of december 31, 2019, we had a cash and cash equivalents balance of $303.6 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business, particularly the growth of tpwr, to repurchase additional sub-shares subject to market conditions, and for general corporate purposes. we believe that cash from operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents balances, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future.

effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our operating results. we cannot assure you, however, that future increases in our costs will not occur or that any such increases that may occur will not adversely affect our results of operations.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. it is our opinion that we fully disclose our significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. consistent with our disclosure policies, we include the following discussion related to what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgment.
accrual of oil and gas royalties the trust accrues oil and gas royalties. an accrual is necessary due to the time lag between the production of oil and gas and generation of the actual payment by operators. the oil and gas royalty accrual is based upon historical payments, estimates of the timing of future payments and recent market prices for oil and gas.

item 1a.    risk factors this annual report on form 10-k contains statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. these statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties including those discussed below. the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. in addition, please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements in item 7 of part ii of this annual report on form 10-k under the heading "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
if we fail to adhere to all of the complex governmental laws, regulations and requirements that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could materially harm our reputation and stock price.
we operate in a complex regulatory environment with an extensive and evolving set of federal, state and local governmental laws, regulations and requirements. these laws, regulations and requirements are promulgated and overseen by a number of different legislative, administrative, regulatory, and quasi-regulatory bodies, each of which may have varying interpretations, judgments or related guidance. as such, we utilize considerable resources on an ongoing basis to monitor, assess and respond to applicable legislative, regulatory and administrative requirements, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts to adhere to all of these requirements. laws, regulations and requirements that apply to or impact our business include, but are not limited to:
•   medicare and medicaid reimbursement statutes, rules and regulations (including, but not limited to, manual provisions, local coverage determinations, national coverage determinations, payment schedules and agency guidance);
•   federal and state anti-kickback laws, including, without limitation, any applicable exceptions or regulatory safe harbors thereunder;
•   the physician self-referral law (the stark law) and analogous state self-referral prohibition laws;
•   the 21st century cures act;
•   federal acquisition regulations;
•   the false claims act (fca) and associated regulations;
•   the civil monetary penalty statute (cmp) and associated regulations;
•   the foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa);
•   medicare and medicaid provider requirements, including requirements associated with providing and updating certain information about the medicare or medicaid entity, as applicable, and its direct and indirect affiliates;
•   antitrust and competition laws and regulations; and
•   federal and state laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of patient health information (e.g., health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa)) and the storage, handling, shipment, disposal and/or dispensing of pharmaceuticals and blood products and other biological materials.
in addition, on october 9, 2019, the u.s. department of health and human services, office of inspector general (oig) and the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) released a pair of proposed rules that, if adopted, would change the federal anti-kickback statute (aks), cmp and stark law regulations to promote certain value-based and coordinated care arrangements. the proposed rules were subject to a comment period ending in december 2019 and remain subject to change until the publication of any final rules, the date and content of which are currently unknown.
we have historically been subject to a five-year corporate integrity agreement (cia) with oig. the term of the cia expired on october 22, 2019, and the company is in the process of working with the independent monitor and oig to close out the review of the final annual reports by the independent monitor and the company. the cia (i) required that we maintain certain elements of our compliance programs; (ii) imposed certain expanded compliance-related requirements during the term of the cia; (iii) required ongoing monitoring and reporting by an independent monitor, imposed certain reporting, certification, records retention and training obligations, allocated certain oversight responsibility to the board's compliance committee, and necessitated the creation of a management compliance committee and the retention of an independent compliance advisor to the board; and (iv) contained certain business restrictions related to a subset of our joint venture arrangements. until oig closes out the cia following review of the aforementioned final annual reports, oig retains the right to impose penalties, sanctions and other consequences on us under the cia, including, without limitation, potential exclusion from federal healthcare programs. any future penalties, sanctions or other consequences under the cia or otherwise could be more severe in circumstances in which oig or a similar regulatory authority determines that we have repeatedly failed to comply with applicable laws, regulations or requirements.
if any of our personnel, representatives or operations are found to violate these or other laws, regulations or requirements, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could materially harm our reputation and stock price, including, among others:
•   loss of required certifications or suspension or exclusion from or termination of our participation in government payment programs;
•   refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable payment program requirements dating back to the applicable statute of limitation periods;
•   loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities or administer pharmaceuticals in the states in which we operate;
•   reductions in payment rates or coverage for dialysis and ancillary services and pharmaceuticals;
•   criminal or civil liability, fines, damages or monetary penalties, which could be material;
•   enforcement actions, investigations, or audits by governmental agencies and/or state law claims for monetary damages by patients who believe their protected health information (phi) has been used, disclosed or not properly safeguarded in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws, including, among others, hipaa and the privacy act of 1974;
•   mandated changes to our practices or procedures that significantly increase operating expenses that could subject us to ongoing audits and reporting requirements as well as increased scrutiny of our billing and business practices which could lead to potential fines, among other things;
•   termination of various relationships and/or contracts related to our business, such as joint venture arrangements, medical director agreements, real estate leases and consulting agreements with physicians; and
•   harm to our reputation which could negatively impact our business relationships and stock price, affect our ability to attract and retain patients, physicians and teammates, affect our ability to obtain financing and decrease access to new business opportunities, among other things.
additionally, the healthcare sector, including the dialysis industry, is regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation. negative publicity, regardless of merit, regarding the dialysis industry generally, the u.s. healthcare system or davita in particular may adversely affect us.
see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further details regarding the pending legal proceedings and regulatory matters to which we are or may be subject from time to time, any of which may include allegations of violations of applicable laws, regulations and requirements.
we are, and may in the future be, a party to various lawsuits, demands, claims, qui tam suits, governmental investigations and audits (including, without limitation, investigations or other actions resulting from our obligation to self-report suspected violations of law) and other legal matters, any of which could result in, among other things, substantial financial penalties or awards against us, mandated refunds, substantial payments made by us, required changes to our business practices, exclusion from future participation in medicare, medicaid and other healthcare programs and possible criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price.
we are, and may in the future be, subject to investigations and audits by governmental agencies and/or private civil qui tam complaints filed by relators and other lawsuits, demands, claims and legal proceedings, including, without limitation, investigations or other actions resulting from our obligation to self-report suspected violations of law.
responding to subpoenas, investigations and other lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings as well as defending ourselves in such matters will continue to require management's attention and cause us to incur significant legal expense. negative

findings or terms and conditions that we might agree to accept as part of a negotiated resolution of pending or future legal or regulatory matters could result in, among other things, substantial financial penalties or awards against us, substantial payments made by us, harm to our reputation, required changes to our business practices, exclusion from future participation in medicare, medicaid and other healthcare programs and, in certain cases, criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. it is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us and/or individuals in our business in connection with governmental investigations. other than as may be described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, we cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of the various legal proceedings and regulatory matters to which we are or may be subject from time to time, or the timing of their resolution or the ultimate losses or impact of developments in those matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further details regarding these and other legal proceedings and regulatory matters.
changes in federal and state healthcare legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
the extensive federal and state laws, regulations and requirements that govern our business may continue to change over time, and there is no assurance that we will be able to accurately predict the nature, timing or extent of such changes or the impact of such changes on the markets in which we conduct business or on the other participants that operate in those markets.
for example, the regulatory framework of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care reconciliation act of 2010, as amended (aca), and other healthcare reforms continues to evolve as a result of executive, legislative, regulatory and administrative developments and judicial proceedings. as such, there remains considerable uncertainty surrounding the continued implementation of the aca and what similar healthcare reform measures or other changes might be enacted at the federal and/or state level. while legislative attempts to completely repeal the aca have been unsuccessful to date, there have been multiple attempts to repeal or amend the aca through legislative action and legal challenges. for example, in december 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was signed into law which, among other things, repealed the penalty under aca's individual mandate, which had required individuals to pay a fee if they failed to obtain a qualifying health insurance plan. in december 2018, a federal district court in texas ruled the individual mandate was unconstitutional and inseverable from the aca. as a result, the court ruled the remaining provisions of the aca were also invalid, though the court declined to issue a preliminary injunction with respect to the aca. in december 2019, the fifth circuit court of appeals agreed that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, but remanded the case back to the district court to reassess how much of the aca would be damaged without the individual mandate provision, and if the individual mandate could indeed be severed from the aca. this litigation is still ongoing, but places great uncertainty upon the longevity and nature of the aca moving forward.
while there may be significant changes to the healthcare environment in the future, including, without limitation, as a result of potential changes to the political environment in connection with the current election year or otherwise, the specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent. nevertheless, previously enacted reforms and future changes, including among others, any changes in legislation, regulation or market conditions in connection with or resulting from the upcoming elections, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. for example, our revenue levels are sensitive to the percentage of our patients with higher-paying commercial health insurance, and as such, legislative, regulatory or other changes that decrease the accessibility and availability, including the duration, of commercial insurance may have a material adverse impact on our business. the aca's health insurance exchanges, which provide a marketplace for eligible individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance, initially increased the accessibility and availability of commercial insurance. however, certain legislative developments, such as the repeal of the individual mandate described above, have adversely impacted the risk pool in certain exchange markets, and the nature and extent of commercial payor participation in the exchanges has fluctuated as a result. other proposed legislative developments or administrative decisions, such as moving to a universal health insurance or "single payor" system whereby health insurance is provided to all americans by the government under government programs, or lowering or eliminating the cost-sharing reduction subsidies under the aca, could impact the percentage of our patients with higher-paying commercial health insurance, impact the scope of coverage under commercial health plans and increase our expenses, among other things. although we cannot predict the short- or long-term effects of legislative or regulatory changes or the potential outcome or impact of the upcoming elections, we believe that future market changes could result in more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates or higher deductibles and co-payments that patients may not be able to pay. to the extent that changes in statutes, regulations or related guidance or changes in other market conditions result in a reduction in the percentage of our patients with commercial insurance, limit the scope or nature of coverage through the exchanges or other health insurance programs or otherwise reduce reimbursement rates for our services from commercial and/or government payors, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. for additional information on the impact of legislative or regulatory changes on the percentage of our patients with commercial insurance, see the risk factor under the heading "if the number of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."
the aca also added several new tax provisions that, among other things, impose various fees and excise taxes, and limit compensation deductions for health insurance providers and their affiliates. these rules could negatively impact our cash flow and tax liabilities. in addition, the aca broadened the potential for penalties under the fca for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments collected from government payors and reduced the timeline to file medicare claims. failure to timely identify, quantify and return overpayments may result in significant penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation. failure to file a claim within the one year window could result in payments denials, adversely affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
in addition to the aca, changing legislation and other regulatory and executive developments have led to the emergence of new models of care and other initiatives in both the government and private sector. any failure on our part to adequately implement strategic initiatives to adjust to these marketplace developments could have a material adverse impact on our business. for example, as noted above, the july 10, 2019 executive order (the 2019 executive order) related to kidney care directed cms to create payment models to evaluate the effects of creating payment incentives for the greater use of home dialysis and kidney transplants for those already on dialysis. cms subsequently announced in a proposed rule the etc mandatory payment model, which will be administered through the cmmi and is proposed to launch in 50% of dialysis clinics across the country beginning in 2020. under the proposed rule, which was subject to a comment period that ended in september 2019, cms would select esrd facilities and clinicians to participate in the model according to their location in randomly selected geographic areas and would require participation to minimize the potential for selection effect. we support the administration's emphasis on and move towards home dialysis and kidney transplant; however, we believe that if launched as proposed, the etc model would negatively impact patient clinical care, medicare coverage and/or payment for esrd claims and, depending on the final requirements of the etc model, ultimately could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. with home dialysis as a focus of the etc model and the industry generally, any failure to successfully implement our strategy or build on our abilities to offer home dialysis options could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, financial condition and cash flows. for additional detail on the risks related to our home dialysis services, see the discussion under the heading "if we are not able to successfully implement our strategy with respect to home-based dialysis, including maintaining and further developing our capabilities in a complex and highly regulated environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could materially harm our reputation."
in connection with the 2019 executive order, cms also announced the implementation of four voluntary payment models with the stated goal of helping healthcare providers reduce the cost and improve the quality of care for patients with late-stage chronic kidney disease and esrd. cms has stated these payment models are aimed to prevent or delay the need for dialysis and encourage kidney transplantation. these payment models were initially proposed to run from 2020 through december 2023. the details and specifics of these voluntary models have not yet been provided, and we anticipate that such details will be released in the second half of 2020. we continue to assess these models and their viability for us and the industry, and our assessment will continue to develop as additional details become available.
in addition, cmmi is currently working with various healthcare providers to develop, refine and implement accountable care organizations (acos) and other innovative models of care for medicare and medicaid beneficiaries, including, without limitation, the comprehensive esrd care model (cec model) (which includes the development of end stage renal disease (esrd) seamless care organizations), the duals demonstration, and other models. we are currently participating in the cec model with cmmi, including with organizations in arizona, florida, and adjacent markets in new jersey and pennsylvania. we may choose to participate in additional models either as a partner with other providers or independently. even in areas where we are not directly participating in these or other cmmi models, some of our patients may be assigned to an aco, another esrd care model, or another program, in which case the quality and cost of care that we furnish will be included in an aco's, another esrd care model's, or other program's calculations.
in addition to the aforementioned new models of care, federal bipartisan legislation related to full capitation demonstration for esrd was proposed in late 2017. legislation, which has yet to secure introduction to the 116th congress, would build on prior coordinated care models, such as the cec model, and would establish a demonstration program for the provision of integrated care to medicare esrd patients. we have made and continue to make investments in building our integrated care capabilities, but there can be no assurances that initiatives such as this or similar legislation will be introduced or passed into law. if such legislation is passed, there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully execute on the required strategic initiatives that would allow us to provide a competitive and successful integrated care program on the broader scale contemplated by this legislation, and in the desired time frame. additionally, the ultimate terms and conditions of any such potential legislation remain unclear-for example, our costs of care could exceed our associated reimbursement rates under such legislation. the new and evolving landscape for integrated kidney care also has led to opportunities with relative ease of entry for certain smaller and/or non-traditional providers, and we may be competing with them for patients in an asymmetrical environment with respect to data and/or regulatory requirements given our status as an esrd service provider. for additional detail on our evolving competitive environment, see the risk factor under the heading "if we are unable to compete successfully, including, without limitation, implementing our growth strategy and/or retaining patients and physicians willing to serve as medical directors, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows." in general, if we are unable to efficiently adjust to these and other new models of care, it may, among other things, erode our patient base or reimbursement rates, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, financial condition and cash flows.
there have also been several state initiatives to limit payments to dialysis providers or impose other burdensome operational requirements, which, if passed, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, financial condition and cash flow. for example, on october 24, 2019, the service employees international union - united healthcare workers west (seiu) proposed a california statewide ballot initiative for the november 2020 election that seeks to impose certain regulatory requirements on dialysis clinics, including requirements related to physician staffing levels, clinical reporting, clinical treatment options and the ability to make decisions on closing or reducing services for dialysis clinics. we expect to incur costs in connection with this new proposal, should it become eligible for the november 2020 election, and other potential legislative or ballot initiatives, and these costs may be substantial. similar initiatives were also proposed in ohio and arizona in the 2018 election cycle; however, neither of these initiatives met the applicable requirements for inclusion on the state ballot for the november 2018 elections. we may face similar ballot initiatives or other legislation in the future in these or other states.
there have also been rule making and legislative efforts at both the federal and state level concerning charitable premium assistance. in december 2016, cms published an interim final rule that questioned the use of charitable premium assistance for esrd patients and would have established new conditions for coverage standards for dialysis facilities. in january 2017, a federal district court in texas issued a preliminary injunction on cms' interim final rule and in june 2017, at the request of cms, the court stayed the proceedings while cms pursues new rulemaking options. in june 2019, cms sent to the white house office of management and budget a proposed rule entitled "conditions for coverage for end-stage renal disease facilities-third party payments." we do not know if or when this proposed rule will be released. in addition, on october 13, 2019 a california bill (ab 290) was signed into law that limits the amount of reimbursement paid to certain providers for services provided to patients with commercial insurance who receive charitable premium assistance. ab 290 was expected to become effective in january 2020. the american kidney fund (akf), an organization that provides charitable premium assistance, announced that it would be withdrawing from california as a result of ab 290. on november 1, 2019, akf filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the law on several grounds. a group of providers, including davita, also filed a lawsuit challenging the law in federal court on november 5, 2019. the parties to each suit also filed motions for preliminary injunctions shortly after filing the lawsuits, seeking to prevent ab 290's implementation during litigation. on december 30, 2019, the district court granted a preliminary injunction. the preliminary injunction will remain in place until a final judgment is made in the case, which is expected to occur in 2020.
in the event ab 290 becomes effective and the akf withdraws from california, we expect an adverse impact on the ability of patients to afford medicare premiums and medicare supplemental (medigap) and commercial coverage, which we expect will in turn result in an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, bills similar to ab 290 were introduced in illinois (sb 650) and oregon (sb 900), but have not been successfully passed to date. if these or similar bills are introduced and implemented in other jurisdictions, and organizations that provide charitable premium assistance in those jurisdictions are similarly impacted, it could in the aggregate have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. for additional information on the impact of decreases to the percentage of our patients with commercial insurance, see the risk factor under the heading "if the number of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows".
any law, rule or guidance proposed or issued by cms or other federal or state regulatory or legislative authorities or others, including, without limitation, any initiatives similar to the proposed legislation and ballot initiatives described above, or other future ballot or other initiatives restricting or prohibiting the ability of patients with access to alternative coverage from selecting a marketplace plan on or off exchange, limiting the amount of revenue that a dialysis provider can retain for caring for patients with commercial insurance, imposing burdensome operational requirements, affecting payments made to providers for services provided to patients who receive charitable premium assistance and/or otherwise restricting or prohibiting the use of charitable premium assistance, could cause us to incur substantial costs to oppose any such proposed measures, impact our dialysis center development plans, and if passed and/or implemented, could adversely impact dialysis centers across the u.s. making certain centers economically unviable, lead to the closure of certain centers, restrict the ability of dialysis patients to obtain and maintain optimal insurance coverage, and in some cases, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
privacy and information security laws are complex, and if we fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf, or if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, protect our proprietary rights to our systems or defend against cybersecurity attacks, we may be subject to government or private actions due to privacy and security breaches, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or materially harm our reputation.
we must comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations in both the u.s. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate governing the collection, dissemination, access, use, security and privacy of phi, including, without limitation, hipaa and its implementing privacy, security, and related regulations, as amended by the federal health information technology for economic and clinical health act (hitech) and collectively referred to as hipaa. we are also required to report known breaches of phi consistent with applicable breach reporting requirements set forth in applicable laws and regulations. from time to time, we may be subject to both federal and state inquiries or audits related to hipaa, hitech and related state laws associated with complaints, desk audits, and self-reported breaches. if we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information, including phi, on our behalf, properly maintain the integrity of our data, protect our proprietary rights, or defend against cybersecurity attacks, it could materially harm our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. these risks may be intensified to the extent that the laws change or to the extent that we increase our use of third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information, including phi, on our behalf.
data protection laws are evolving globally, and may continue to add additional compliance costs and legal risks to our international operations. in europe, the general data protection regulation (gdpr) became effective on may 25, 2018. the gdpr applies to entities that are established in the european union (eu), as well as extends the scope of eu data protection laws to foreign companies processing data of individuals in the eu. the gdpr imposes a comprehensive data protection regime with the potential for regulatory fines as well as data breach litigation by impacted data subjects. under the gdpr, regulatory penalties may be assessed by data protection authorities for up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover or €20 million. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the gdpr and other new laws, regulations and policies implementing the gdpr may impact our european operations and/or limit the ways in which we can provide services or use personal data collected while providing services. if we fail to comply with the requirements of gdpr, we could be subject to penalties that would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
data protection laws are also evolving nationally, and may add additional compliance costs and legal risks to our u.s. operations. for example, the california legislature recently passed the california consumer protection act (ccpa), which became effective january 1, 2020. the ccpa is a privacy law that requires certain companies doing business in california to enhance privacy disclosures regarding the collection, use and sharing of a consumer's personal data. the ccpa grants consumers additional privacy rights that are broader than current federal privacy rights. the ccpa also permits the imposition of civil penalties, grants enforcement authority to the state attorney general and provides a private right of action for consumers where certain personal information is breached due to unreasonable information security practices. several other states, including nevada and maine, have passed data protection laws similar to ccpa. these laws would impose organizational requirements and grant individual rights that are comparable to those established in the ccpa, and other states may pass similar legislation in the future. in particular, the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs) office for civil rights, in partnership with the healthcare and public health sector coordinating council (hscc), recently issued cybersecurity guidelines for healthcare organizations that reflect consensus-based, voluntary practices to cost-effectively reduce cybersecurity risks for organizations of varying sizes. although these hhs-backed guidelines, entitled "health industry cybersecurity practices: managing threats and protecting patients," are voluntary, they are likely to serve as an important reference point for the healthcare industry, and may cause us to invest additional resources in technology, personnel and programmatic cybersecurity controls as the cybersecurity risks we face continue to evolve.
information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including, among others, foreign state agents. our business and operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks, including sensitive personal information, including phi, social security numbers, and credit card information of our patients, teammates, physicians, business partners and others.
we regularly review, monitor and implement multiple layers of security measures through technology, processes and our people. we utilize security technologies designed to protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data, and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. despite these efforts, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to privacy and security incidents; security attacks and breaches; acts of vandalism or theft; computer viruses and other malicious code; coordinated attacks by a variety of actors, including, among others, activist entities or state sponsored cyberattacks; emerging cybersecurity risks; cyber risk related to connected devices; misplaced or lost data; programming and/or human errors; or other similar events that could impact the security, reliability and availability of our systems. internal or external parties may attempt to circumvent our security systems, and we have in the past, and expect that we will in the future, experience external attacks on our network including, without limitation, reconnaissance probes, denial of service attempts, malicious software attacks including ransomware or other attacks intended to render our internal operating systems or data unavailable, and phishing attacks or business email compromise. cybersecurity requires ongoing investment and diligence against evolving threats. emerging and advanced security threats, including, without limitation, coordinated attacks, require additional layers of security which may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations. as with any security program, there always exists the risk that employees will violate our policies despite our compliance efforts or that certain attacks may be beyond the ability of our security and other systems to detect. there can be no assurance that investments, diligence and/or our internal controls will be sufficient to prevent or timely discover an attack.
any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, including, among others, phi, financial data, competitively sensitive information, or other proprietary data, whether by us or a third party, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and materially harm our reputation. we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, or to make required notifications. the occurrence of any of these events could, among other things, result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data, cessations in the availability of systems and liability under privacy and security laws, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, or materially harm our reputation and trigger regulatory actions and private party litigation. if we are unable to protect the physical and electronic security and privacy of our databases and transactions, we could be subject to potential liability and regulatory action, our reputation and relationships with our patients, physicians, vendors and other business partners would be harmed, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems (including our networks) and data, or to defend against cybersecurity attacks, could subject us to monetary fines, civil suits, civil penalties or criminal sanctions and requirements to disclose the breach publicly, and could further result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or harm our reputation. as malicious cyber activity escalates, including activity that originates outside of the u.s., the risks we face relating to transmission of data and our use of service providers outside of our network, as well as the storing or processing of data within our network, intensify. there have been increased international, federal and state and other privacy, data protection and security enforcement efforts and we expect this trend to continue. while we intend to maintain cyber liability insurance, this insurance may not cover us for all types of losses and may not be sufficient to protect us against the amount of all losses.
if the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly or if patients in commercial plans are subject to restriction in plan designs, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
approximately 31% of our u.s. dialysis net patient services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019, were generated from patients who have commercial payors (including hospital dialysis services) as their primary payor. the majority of these patients have insurance policies that pay us on terms and at rates that are generally significantly higher than medicare rates. the payments we receive from commercial payors generate nearly all of our profit and all of our nonacute dialysis profits come from commercial payors. we continue to experience downward pressure on some of our commercial payment rates as a result of general conditions in the market, including as employers shift to less expensive options for medical services, recent and future consolidations among commercial payors, increased focus on dialysis services and other factors. commercial payment rates could be materially lower in the future due to these or other factors.
we continuously are in the process of negotiating existing and potential new agreements with commercial payors who aggressively negotiate terms with us, and we can make no assurances about the ultimate results of these negotiations or the timing of any potential rate changes resulting from these negotiations. sometimes many significant agreements are being renegotiated at the same time. in the event that our continual negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, the cumulative effect could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we believe payor consolidations have significantly increased the negotiating leverage of commercial payors, and ongoing consolidations may continue to increase this leverage in the future. our negotiations with payors are also influenced by competitive pressures, and we may experience decreased contracted rates with commercial payors or experience decreases in patient volume, including if we turn away new patients in instances where we are unable to come to agreement with commercial payors on rates, as our negotiations with commercial payors continue.
certain payors have also been attempting to design and implement plans that restrict access to esrd coverage both in the commercial and individual market. among other things, these restrictive plan designs seek to limit the duration and/or the breadth of esrd benefits, limit the number of in-network providers, set arbitrary provider reimbursement rates, or otherwise restrict access to care, all of which may result in a decrease in the number of patients covered by commercial insurance. payors may also dispute the scope and duration of esrd benefit coverage under their plans. any of the foregoing, including developments in plan design or new business activities of commercial payors, may lead to a significant decrease in the number of patients with commercial plans, the duration of benefits for patients under commercial plans and/or a significant decrease in the payment rates we receive, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
in addition, some commercial payors are pursuing or have incorporated policies into their provider manuals limiting or refusing to accept charitable premium assistance from non-profit organizations, such as the american kidney fund, which may impact the number of patients who are able to afford commercial plans. paying for coverage is a significant financial burden for many patients, and esrd disproportionately affects the low-income population. charitable premium assistance supports continuity of coverage and access to care for patients, many of whom are unable to continue working full-time as a result of their severe condition. a material restriction in patients' ability to access charitable premium assistance may restrict the ability of dialysis patients to obtain and maintain optimal insurance coverage, and may adversely impact a large number of dialysis centers across the u.s. by making certain centers economically unviable, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
for additional details regarding the impact of a decline in our patients under commercial plans, see the risk factor under the heading "if the number of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows." for additional details regarding specific risks we face regarding potential legislative or regulatory changes that, among other things, could result in fewer patients covered under commercial plans or an increase of patients covered under more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates, see the discussion in the risk factor under the heading "changes in federal and state healthcare legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."
if the number of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
our revenue levels are sensitive to the percentage of our patients with higher-paying commercial insurance coverage. a patient's insurance coverage may change for a number of reasons, including changes in the patient's or a family member's employment status. a material portion of our commercial revenue is concentrated with a limited number of commercial payors, and any changes impacting our highest paying commercial payors will have a disproportionate impact on us. in addition, many patients with commercial and government insurance rely on financial assistance from charitable organizations, such as the american kidney fund. certain payors have challenged our patients' and other providers' patients' ability to utilize assistance from charitable organizations for the payment of premiums, including, without limitation, through litigation and other legal proceedings. the use of charitable premium assistance for esrd patients has also faced challenges and inquiries from legislators, regulators and other governmental authorities, and this may continue. in addition, cms or another regulatory agency or legislative authority may issue a new rule or guidance that challenges or restricts charitable premium assistance. for additional details, see the discussion under the heading "changes in federal and state healthcare legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows." if any of these challenges to kidney patients' use of premium assistance are successful or restrictions are imposed on the use of financial assistance from such charitable organizations or if organizations providing such assistance are no longer available such that kidney patients are unable to obtain, or continue to receive or receive for a limited duration, such financial assistance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, if our assumptions about how kidney patients will respond to any change in financial assistance from charitable organizations are incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
when medicare becomes the primary payor, the payment rate we receive for that patient decreases from the employer group health plan or commercial plan rate to the lower medicare payment rate. if the number of our patients who have medicare or another government-based program as their primary payor increases, it could negatively impact the percentage of our patients covered under commercial insurance plans. there are a number of factors that could drive a decline in the percentage of our patients covered under commercial insurance plans, including, among others, a continued decline in the rate of growth of the esrd patient population, continued improved mortality or the reduced availability of commercial health plans or reduced coverage by such plans through the aca exchanges or otherwise due to changes to the marketplace, healthcare regulatory system or otherwise. commercial payors could also cease paying in the primary position after providing 30 months of coverage resulting in potentially material reductions in payment as the patient moves to medicare primary. moreover, declining macroeconomic conditions could also negatively impact the percentage of our patients covered under commercial insurance plans. to the extent there are sustained or increased job losses in the u.s., we could experience a decrease in the number of patients covered under commercial plans and/or an increase in uninsured and underinsured patients independent of whether general economic conditions improve. we could also experience higher numbers of uninsured and underinsured patients, which would result in an increase in uncollectible accounts.
finally, the ultimate results of our continual negotiations with commercial payors under existing and potential new agreements cannot be predicted and, among other things, could result in a decrease in the number of our patients covered by commercial plans to the extent that we cannot reach agreement with commercial payors on rates and other terms, resulting in termination or non-renewals of existing agreements and our inability to enter into new agreements. our agreements and rates with commercial payors may be impacted by new business activities of these commercial payors as well as steps that these commercial payors have taken and may continue to take to control the cost of and/or the eligibility for access to the services that we provide, including, without limitation, relative to products on and off the healthcare exchanges. these efforts could impact the number of our patients who are eligible to enroll in commercial insurance plans, and remain on the plans, including plans offered through healthcare exchanges. for additional detail on the risks related to commercial payor activity, including restrictive plan design, see the discussion under the heading "if the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly or if patients in commercial plans are subject to restriction in plan designs, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows." we could also experience a further decrease in the payments we receive for services if changes to the marketplace or the healthcare regulatory system result in fewer patients covered under commercial plans or an increase of patients covered under more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates, among other things.
if there is a significant reduction in the number of patients under higher-paying commercial plans relative to government-based programs that pay at lower rates or a significant increase in the number of patients that are uninsured and underinsured, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
if we are not able to successfully implement our strategy with respect to home-based dialysis, including maintaining our existing business and further developing our capabilities in a complex and highly regulated environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could materially harm our reputation.
our home-based dialysis services, which include home hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis (pd), represented approximately 16% of our u.s. dialysis patient services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019, and have increasingly become an important part of our overall strategy. in addition, home-based dialysis recently has been the subject of increased political and industry focus. for example, in connection with the 2019 executive order, hhs set out specific goals related to home dialysis and cmmi announced a proposed mandatory model that included new incentives to encourage dialysis at home. we are a leader in home-based dialysis and have made investments in processes and infrastructure to continue to grow this modality. there are, however, risks associated with this growth, including, among other things, financial, legal and operational risks related to our ability to design and develop infrastructure and to plan for capacity in a modality that is part of an evolving marketplace. we may also be subject to associated risks related to our ability to successfully manage related operational initiatives, find, train and retain appropriate staff, contract with payors for appropriate reimbursement, and maintain processes to adhere to the complex regulatory and legal requirements, including without limitation those associated with billing medicare. for additional detail on risks associated with operating in a highly regulated environment, see "if we fail to adhere to all of the complex governmental laws, regulations and requirements that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could materially harm our reputation and stock price." in addition to the above risks, certain risks inherent to home-based dialysis will increase as we expand our home-based dialysis offerings, including risks related to managing transitions between in-center and home-based dialysis, billing and telehealth systems, among others. for additional detail on risks associated with information systems and new technology generally, see the discussion under the heading "failing to effectively maintain, operate or upgrade our information systems or those of third-party service providers upon which we rely, including, without limitation, our clinical, billing and collections systems could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."
an increased focus on home-based dialysis is also indicative of the generally evolving market for kidney care. this developing market may create additional opportunities for competition with relative ease of entry, and if we are unable to successfully adapt to these marketplace developments in a timely and compliant manner, we may see a reduction in our overall number of patients, among other things. for additional detail on the competitive landscape in kidney care, see the discussion under the heading "if we are unable to compete successfully, including, without limitation, implementing our growth strategy and/or retaining patients and physicians willing to serve as medical directors, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows." if we are not able to successfully implement our strategy with respect to home-based dialysis, including maintaining our existing business and further developing our capabilities in a complex and highly regulated environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could materially harm our reputation.
changes in the structure of and payment rates under the medicare esrd program could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
approximately 42% of our u.s. dialysis net patient services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019, were generated from patients who have medicare as their primary payor. for patients with medicare coverage, all esrd payments for dialysis treatments are currently made under a single bundled payment rate which provides a fixed payment rate to encompass all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment that are related to the treatment of dialysis, including pharmaceuticals that were historically separately reimbursed to the dialysis providers, such as erythropoietin (epo), vitamin d analogs and iron supplements, irrespective of the level of pharmaceuticals administered or additional services performed, except in the case of calcimimetics, which are subject to a transitional drug add-on payment adjustment for the medicare part b esrd payment. most lab services are also included in the bundled payment. under the esrd prospective payment system (pps), the bundled payments to a dialysis facility may be reduced by as much as 2% based on the facility's performance in specified quality measures set annually by cms through the esrd quality incentive program, which was established by the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008. the bundled payment rate is also adjusted for certain patient characteristics, a geographic usage index and certain other factors. in addition, the esrd pps is subject to rebasing, which can have a positive financial effect, or a negative one if the government fails to rebase in a manner that adequately addresses the costs borne by dialysis facilities. similarly, as new drugs, services or labs are added to the esrd bundle, cms' failure to adequately calculate the costs associated with the drugs, services or labs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
the current bundled payment system presents certain operating, clinical and financial risks, which include, without limitation:
•   risk that our rates are reduced by cms. uncertainty about future payment rates remains a material risk to our business. cms publishes a final rule for the esrd pps each year; the final rule for 2020 was issued on october 31, 2019.
•   risk that cms, on its own or through its contracted medicare administrative contractors (macs) or otherwise, implements local coverage determinations (lcds) or implements payment provisions, policy or regulatory mandates, including changes to the existing or future pps, that limit our ability to either be paid for covered dialysis services or bill for treatments or other drugs and services or other rules that may impact reimbursement. such payment rules and regulations and coverage determinations or related decisions could have an adverse impact on our operations and revenue. there is also risk commercial insurers could seek to incorporate the requirements or limitations associated with such lcds or cms guidance into their contracted terms with dialysis providers, which could have an adverse impact on our revenue.
•   risk that a mac, or multiple macs, change their interpretations of existing regulations, manual provisions and/or guidance, or seek to implement or enforce new interpretations that are inconsistent with how we have interpreted existing regulations, manual provisions and/or guidance.
•   risk that increases in our operating costs will outpace the medicare rate increases we receive. we expect operating costs to continue to increase due to inflationary factors, such as increases in labor and supply costs, including, without limitation, increases in maintenance costs and capital expenditures to improve, renovate and maintain our facilities, equipment and information technology to meet changing regulatory requirements and business needs, regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation-based increase in medicare payment rates or in payments under the bundled payment rate system.
•   risk of continued federal budget sequestration cuts. as a result of the budget control act of 2011 and the bba, an annual 2% reduction to medicare payments took effect on april 1, 2013, and has been extended through 2027. these across-the-board spending cuts have affected and will continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
•   risk that failure to adequately develop and maintain our clinical systems or failure of our clinical systems to operate effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. for example, in connection with claims for which at least part of the government's payments to us is based on clinical performance or patient outcomes or co-morbidities, if our clinical systems fail to accurately capture the data we report to cms or we otherwise have data integrity issues with respect to the reported information, we might be over-reimbursed by the government, which could subject us to liability. for example, cms published a final rule that implemented a provision of the aca, requiring providers to report and return medicare and medicaid overpayments within the later of (a) 60 days after the overpayment is identified and quantified, or (b) the date any corresponding cost report is due, if applicable. an overpayment impermissibly retained under this statute could, among other things, subject us to liability under the fca, exclusion from participation in the federal healthcare programs, and penalties under the federal civil monetary penalty statute and could adversely impact our reputation.
we are subject to similar risks for services billed separately from the esrd bundled payment, including, without limitation, the risk that a mac, or multiple macs, change their interpretations of existing regulations, manual provisions and/or guidance; or seek to implement or enforce new interpretations that are inconsistent with how we have interpreted existing regulations, manual provisions and/or guidance. for additional details regarding the risks we face for failing to adhere to our medicare and medicaid regulatory compliance obligations, see the risk factor above under the heading "if we fail to adhere to all of the complex governmental laws, regulations and requirements that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could materially harm our reputation and stock price."
in addition, changing legislation and other regulatory and executive developments have led and may continue to lead to the emergence of new models of care and other initiatives in both the government and private sector that, among other things, impact the structure of, and payment rates under, the medicare esrd program. for additional details regarding the risks we face for failing to adequately implement strategic initiatives to adjust to these marketplace developments, see the risk factor above under the heading "changes in federal and state healthcare legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."
moreover, the number of our patients with primary medicare coverage may be subject to change, particularly with the upcoming january 1, 2021 effective date under the 21st century cures act, which will allow medicare-eligible individuals with esrd to enroll in medicare part c medicare advantage (ma) managed care plans. we continue to evaluate the potential impact of this change in benefit eligibility, as there is significant uncertainty as to how many or which newly eligible esrd patients will seek to enroll in ma plans for their esrd benefits and how quickly any such changes would occur. if we fail to maintain contracts with ma payors with competitive rates, if our assumptions about how kidney patients will respond to the 21st century cures act are incorrect or if we fail to provide education to kidney patients in the manner specified by cms, we could be subject to certain clinical, operational, financial and legal risks, which could be material.
changes in state medicaid or other non-medicare government-based programs or payment rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
approximately 27% of our u.s. dialysis net patient services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019, were generated from patients who have state medicaid or other non-medicare government-based programs, such as coverage through the department of veterans affairs (va), as their primary coverage. as state governments and other governmental organizations face increasing budgetary pressure, we may in turn face reductions in payment rates, delays in the receipt of payments, limitations on enrollee eligibility or other changes to the applicable programs. for example, certain state medicaid programs and the va have recently considered, proposed or implemented payment rate reductions.
the va adopted medicare's bundled pps pricing methodology for any veterans receiving treatment from non-va providers under a national contracting initiative. since we are a non-va provider, these reimbursements are tied to a percentage of medicare reimbursement, and we have exposure to any dialysis reimbursement changes made by cms. approximately 3% of our u.s. dialysis net patient services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019 were generated by the va.
in 2019, we entered into a nationwide dialysis services contract with the va that includes five separate one-year renewal periods throughout the term of the contract. the term structure is similar to our prior five-year agreement with the va, and is consistent with va practice for similar provider agreements. with this contract award, the va has agreed to keep our percentage of medicare reimbursement consistent with that under our prior agreement with the va during the term of the contract. as with that prior agreement, this agreement provides the va with the right to terminate the agreements without cause on short notice. should the va renegotiate, or not renew or cancel these agreements for any reason, we may cease accepting patients under this program and may be forced to close centers or experience lower reimbursement rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
state medicaid programs are increasingly adopting medicare-like bundled payment systems, but sometimes these payment systems are poorly defined and are implemented without any claims processing infrastructure, or patient or facility adjusters. if these payment systems are implemented without any adjusters and claims processing infrastructure, medicaid payments will be substantially reduced and the costs to submit such claims may increase, which will have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, some state medicaid program eligibility requirements mandate that citizen enrollees in such programs provide documented proof of citizenship. if our patients cannot meet these proof of citizenship documentation requirements, they may be denied coverage under these programs, resulting in decreased patient volumes and revenue. these medicaid payment and enrollment changes, along with similar changes to other non-medicare government programs could reduce the rates paid by these programs for dialysis and related services, delay the receipt of payment for services provided and further limit eligibility for coverage which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
changes in clinical practices, payment rates or regulations impacting pharmaceuticals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows and negatively impact our ability to care for patients.
medicare bundles certain pharmaceuticals into the esrd pps payment rate at industry average doses and prices. variations above the industry average may be subject to partial reimbursement through the pps outlier reimbursement policy.
changes to industry averages, which can be caused by, among other things, changes in physician prescribing practices, including in response to the introduction of new drugs, treatments or technologies, changes in best and/or accepted clinical practice, changes in private or governmental payment criteria regarding pharmaceuticals, or the introduction of administration policies may negatively impact our ability to obtain sufficient reimbursement levels for the care we provide, and all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. physician practice patterns, including their independent determinations as to appropriate pharmaceuticals and dosing, are subject to change, including, for example, as a result of changes in labeling of pharmaceuticals or the introduction of new pharmaceuticals. additionally, commercial payors have increasingly examined their administration policies for pharmaceuticals and, in some cases, have modified those policies. if such policy and practice trends or other changes to private and governmental payment criteria make it more difficult to preserve our margins per treatment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. further, increased utilization of certain pharmaceuticals whose costs are included in a bundled reimbursement rate, or decreases in reimbursement for pharmaceuticals whose costs are not included in a bundled reimbursement rate, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and cash flows.
changes in regulations impacting pharmaceuticals could similarly affect our operating results. for example, as of january 1, 2018, calcimimetics became part of the medicare part b esrd payment, subject to a transitional drug add-on payment adjustment (tdapa). we implemented operational and clinical processes designed to provide the drug as required under the applicable regulations and as prescribed by physicians, and also worked to contract with payors and manufacturers to provide for access to and distribution of the drug. if the government or other payors implement new requirements for patients to receive the drug, if we are not adequately reimbursed for the cost of the drug, or the processes we have implemented to provide the drug do not perform as anticipated, then we could be subject to both financial and operational risk, among other things. during this transitional period, the wider availability of generic supplies of oral calcimimetics has driven the acquisition cost of that drug down, which will in turn continue to lower associated reimbursement rates. cms intends to add calcimimetics into the bundle as of january 1, 2021, but at this time we cannot predict the specifics of how cms will incorporate oral and intravenous calcimimetics into the medicare bundle. each of these factors could lead to significant fluctuations in our associated levels of operating income, among other things.
similar operating and clinical rigor and processes will be needed for other potential new drugs, treatments or technologies that are approved and come onto the market. any failure to successfully contract with manufacturers for competitive pricing, failure to successfully contract with the government or other payors for appropriate reimbursement, or failure to prepare, develop and implement processes that provide for appropriate availability and use in our clinics could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additionally, as new kidney care drugs, treatments or technologies are introduced over time, we expect that the use of transitional payment adjustments to incorporate certain of these new drugs, treatments or technologies as defined by the cms policy into the bundled medicare part b esrd payment may lead to fluctuations in associated levels of operating income and risk that the reimbursement levels of such drugs, treatments or technologies may not adequately cover our cost to obtain the drug or other associated costs due to, among other things, the risk that cms may not provide adequate funding in the medicare part b esrd payment in the post-transitional period or such items are not covered by transitional add on pricing, in which case there may be less clarity on the reimbursement, either of which may in turn adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we may also be subject to increased inquiries or audits from a variety of governmental bodies or claims by third parties related to pharmaceuticals, which would require management's attention and could result in significant legal expense. any negative findings could result in, among other things, substantial financial penalties or repayment obligations, the imposition of certain obligations on and changes to our practices and procedures as well as the attendant financial burden on us to comply with the obligations, or exclusion from future participation in the medicare and medicaid programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation. for additional details, see the risk factor under the heading "if we fail to adhere to all of the complex governmental laws, regulations and requirements that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could materially harm our reputation and stock price."
if we are unable to compete successfully, including, without limitation, implementing our growth strategy and/or retaining patients and physicians willing to serve as medical directors, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
patient retention and the continued referrals of patients from referral sources such as hospitals and nephrologists, as well as acquisitions are some of the important parts of our growth strategy. in our u.s. dialysis business, we continue to face intense competition from large and medium-sized providers, among others, which compete directly with us for the limited acquisition targets as well as for individual patients and physicians qualified to serve as medical directors. u.s. regulations require medical directors for each center. as we and our competitors continue to grow and open new dialysis centers, we may not be able to retain an adequate number of nephrologists to serve as medical directors. competition in existing and expanding geographies or areas is intense, and is not limited to large competitors with substantial financial resources or to established participants in the dialysis space. we also compete with individual nephrologists who have opened their own dialysis units or facilities. moreover, as we continue our expansion into various international markets, we will continue to face competition from large and medium-sized providers, among others, for acquisition targets.
in addition, fresenius usa, our largest competitor, manufactures a full line of dialysis supplies and equipment in addition to owning and operating dialysis centers. this may give it cost advantages over us because of its ability to manufacture its own products or prevent us from accessing existing or new technology on a cost-effective basis. see further discussion regarding risks associated with our suppliers and new technologies under the heading "if certain of our suppliers do not meet our needs, if there are material price increases on supplies, if we are not reimbursed or adequately reimbursed for drugs we purchase or if we are unable to effectively access new technology or superior products, it could negatively impact our ability to effectively provide the services we offer and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."
in addition to traditional dialysis providers, there have been a number of announcements by non-traditional dialysis providers and others, which relate to entry into the dialysis and pre-dialysis space, the development of innovative technologies, or the commencement of new business activities that could be disruptive to the industry. some of these new entrants have considerable financial resources. although these and other potential competitors may face operational or financial challenges, the highly-competitive and evolving dialysis and pre-dialysis marketplaces have presented some opportunities for relative ease of entry for these and other potential competitors. as a result, we may compete with these smaller or non-traditional providers or others in an asymmetrical environment with respect to data and regulatory requirements that we face as an esrd service provider, thereby negatively impacting our ability to effectively compete. these and other factors have continued to drive change in the dialysis and pre-dialysis space, and if we are unable to successfully adapt to these dynamics, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
furthermore, each of the aforementioned competitive pressures and related risks may be impacted by a continued decline in the rate of growth of the esrd patient population or other reductions in demand for dialysis treatments. based on the recent 2019 annual data report from the united states renal data system (usrds), the underlying esrd dialysis patient population has grown at an approximate compound rate of 3.6% from 2007 to 2017 and a compound rate of 3.3% from 2012 to 2017, which suggests that the rate of growth of the esrd patient population is declining. a number of factors may impact esrd growth rates, including, without limitation, the aging of the u.s. population, incidence rates for diseases that cause kidney failure such as diabetes and hypertension, mortality rates for dialysis patients and growth rates of minority populations with higher than average incidence rates of esrd. in addition, the number of kidney transplants has been increasing in recent years and the historical improvement in the mortality rate of patients with esrd appears to be plateauing, each of which may impact esrd growth rates. this transplant rate may continue to increase in future years, particularly in light of the recent 2019 executive order and cmmi's proposed new goals and measures to increase access to kidney transplants. in addition, one of the stated goals of the 2019 executive order and cmmi's proposed rule is to reduce esrd. for additional information, see the discussion under the heading "changes in the structure of and payment rates under the medicare esrd program could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."
if we are not able to effectively implement our growth strategy, including by making acquisitions at the desired pace or at all; if we are not able to continue to maintain the expected or desired level of non-acquired growth; or if we experience significant patient attrition either as a result of new business activities in the dialysis or pre-dialysis space by our existing competitors, other market participants, new entrants, new technology or other forms of competition, or as a result of reductions in demand for dialysis treatments, including, without limitation, reduced prevalence of esrd or an increase in the number of kidney transplants, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions, which may materially affect our results of operations, debt-to-capital ratio, capital expenditures or other aspects of our business, and, under certain circumstances, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could materially harm our reputation.
our business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of dialysis centers and other businesses, as well as through entry into joint ventures. we may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions or expand into new business lines or models, which may affect our results of operations, debt-to-capital ratio, capital expenditures or other aspects of our business. there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or merger partners or buyers for dispositions or that, if identified, we will be able to agree to terms with merger partners, acquire these targets or make these dispositions on acceptable terms or on the desired timetable. there can also be no assurance that we will be successful in completing any acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we announce, executing new business lines or models or integrating any acquired business into our overall operations. there is no guarantee that we will be able to operate acquired businesses successfully as stand-alone businesses, or that any such acquired business will operate profitably or will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or materially harm our reputation. in addition, acquisition, merger or joint venture activity conducted as part of our overall growth strategy is subject to antitrust and competition laws, and antitrust regulators can investigate future (or pending) and consummated transactions. these laws could impact our ability to pursue these transactions, and under certain circumstances, could result in mandated divestitures, among other things. if a proposed transaction or series of transactions is subject to challenge under antitrust or competition laws, we may incur substantial legal costs, management's attention and resources may be diverted, and if we are found to have violated these or other related laws, regulations or requirements, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could materially harm our reputation and stock price. for additional detail, see the discussion under the heading "if we fail to adhere to all of the complex governmental laws, regulations and requirements that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could materially harm our reputation and stock price." further, we cannot be certain that key talented individuals at the business being acquired will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they will be able to continue to successfully manage or have adequate resources to successfully operate any acquired business. in addition, certain of our acquired dialysis centers and facilities have been in service for many years, which may result in a higher level of maintenance costs. further, our facilities, equipment and information technology may need to be improved or renovated to maintain or increase operational efficiency, compete for patients and medical directors, or meet changing regulatory requirements. increases in maintenance costs and any continued increases in capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
businesses we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities or liabilities that are in excess of the amounts that we originally estimated, and may have other issues, including, without limitation, those related to internal controls over financial reporting or issues that could affect our ability to comply with healthcare laws and regulations and other laws applicable to our expanded business, which could harm our reputation. as a result, we cannot make any assurances that the acquisitions we consummate will be successful. although we generally seek indemnification from the sellers of businesses we acquire for matters that are not properly disclosed to us, we are not always successful. in addition, even in cases where we are able to obtain indemnification, we may discover liabilities greater than the contractual limits, the amounts held in escrow for our benefit (if any), or the financial resources of the indemnifying party. in the event that we are responsible for liabilities substantially in excess of any amounts recovered through rights to indemnification or alternative remedies that might be available to us, or any applicable insurance, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could materially harm our reputation.
we have in the past decided, and may in the future decide, to dispose of certain assets or businesses, such as the disposition of our dmg business, which we completed in june 2019. the sale of dmg results in a less diversified portfolio of businesses, and we have a greater dependency on the performance of our kidney care business for our financial results, which makes us more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if we had retained the dmg business.
in addition, under the terms of the equity purchase agreement in connection with the dmg sale agreement, as amended (the dmg sale agreement) (and subject to the limitations therein), we agreed to certain indemnification obligations. as a result, we may become obligated to make payments to the buyer relating to our previous ownership and operation of the dmg business. claims giving rise to these potential payments include, without limitation, claims related to breaches of our representations and warranties and covenants, including claims for breaches of our representations and warranties regarding compliance with law, litigation, absence of undisclosed liabilities, employee benefit matters, labor matters, or taxes, among others, and other claims for which we provided the buyer with a special indemnity. any such post-closing liabilities and required payments under the dmg sale agreement, or otherwise, or in connection with any other past or future disposition of material assets or businesses could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could materially harm our reputation. further, the purchase price in the dmg sale agreement is subject to customary post-closing adjustments, including, without limitation, as a result of certain net working capital adjustments. we are currently engaged with optum concerning what, if any, net working capital adjustment or other potential adjustments to the purchase price are appropriate, via the process set forth in the dmg sale agreement. any negative adjustments to the purchase price, including, without limitation, as a result of this ongoing engagement with optum, could result in a material adverse change in the amount of consideration that we are able to retain.
additionally, joint ventures, including, without limitation, our asia pacific joint venture, and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment. in addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partner, controlling shareholders or management may require us to make capital contributions or necessitate other payments, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, result in reputational harm to us or adversely affect the value of our investment or partnership, among other things. in addition, we have potential obligations to purchase the interests held by third parties in many of our joint ventures as a result of put provisions that are exercisable at the third party's discretion within specified time periods, pursuant to the applicable agreement. if these put provisions were exercised, we would be required to purchase the third party owner's equity interest, generally at the appraised market value. there can be no assurances that these joint ventures and/or minority investments, including, without limitation, our asia pacific joint venture, ultimately will be successful.
if certain of our suppliers do not meet our needs, if there are material price increases on supplies, if we are not reimbursed or adequately reimbursed for drugs we purchase or if we are unable to effectively access new technology or superior products, it could negatively impact our ability to effectively provide the services we offer and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we have significant suppliers, with a substantial portion of our total vendor spend concentrated with a limited number of third party suppliers. these third party suppliers include, without limitation, suppliers of pharmaceuticals that may be the primary source of products critical to the services we provide, or to which we have committed obligations to make purchases, sometimes at particular prices. if any of these suppliers do not meet our needs for the products they supply, including, without limitation, in the event of a product recall, shortage or dispute, and we are not able to find adequate alternative sources, if we experience material price increases from these suppliers that we are unable to mitigate, or if some of the drugs that we purchase from our suppliers are not reimbursed or not adequately reimbursed by commercial or government payors, or if we are unable to secure products, including pharmaceuticals at competitive rates and within the desired time frame, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, the technology related to the products critical to the services we provide is subject to new developments which may result in superior products. if we are not able to access superior products on a cost-effective basis or if suppliers are not able to fulfill our requirements for such products, we could face patient attrition and other negative consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
the level of our current and future debt could have an adverse impact on our business, and our ability to generate cash to service our indebtedness and for other intended purposes depends on many factors beyond our control.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness outstanding and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase authorization discussed under "stock repurchases" in part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." as described in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, we are party to a $5.5 billion senior secured credit agreement (the credit agreement), which consists of a secured term loan a facility in the aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion with a delayed draw feature, a secured term loan b facility in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.75 billion and a secured revolving line of credit in the aggregate principal amount of $1 billion. our long-term indebtedness also includes $3.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes.
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and for other intended purposes, it could, for example:
•   make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt;
•   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, repurchases of stock at the levels intended or announced, or at all, and other general corporate purposes;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate;
•   expose us to interest rate volatility that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and our ability to service our indebtedness;
•   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and
•   limit our ability to borrow additional funds, or to refinance existing debt on favorable terms when otherwise available or at all.
in addition, we may continue to incur indebtedness in the future, and the amount of that additional indebtedness may be substantial. although the indentures governing our senior notes and the credit agreement include covenants that could limit our indebtedness, we currently have, and expect to continue to have, the ability to incur substantial additional debt. the risks described in this risk factor could intensify as new debt is added to current debt levels.
our senior secured credit facilities bear, and other indebtedness we may incur in the future may bear, interest at a variable rate. as a result, at any given time interest rates on the senior secured credit facilities and any other variable rate debt could be higher or lower than current levels. if interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and therefore net income and associated cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease.
our indebtedness levels and the required payments on such indebtedness may also be impacted by expected reforms related to libor. the variable interest rates payable under our senior secured credit facilities are linked to libor as the benchmark for establishing such rates. recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and reform proposals regarding libor are expected to ultimately cause libor to be discontinued or become unavailable as a rate benchmark. this resultant uncertainty may cause libor to perform differently than in the past. the consequences of these developments with respect to libor cannot be entirely predicted, but could disrupt the financial and credit markets or adversely affect the variable interest rates associated with our current or future indebtedness. our senior secured credit facilities include mechanics to facilitate the adoption by us and our lenders of an alternative benchmark rate for use in place of libor; however, no assurance can be made that we and our lenders will agree on such an alternative rate and, even if agreed upon, such alternative rate may not perform in a manner similar to libor and may result in interest rates that are higher or lower than those that would have resulted had libor remained in effect.
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts, including, without limitation, any strategic acquisitions we may make in the future, to repurchase our stock at the levels intended or announced and to meet our other liquidity needs, will depend on our ability to generate cash. this depends not only on the success of our business but is also subject to economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. with the closing of the sale of dmg, our cash flows have been reduced accordingly. we cannot provide assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future or that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our working capital and other liquidity needs, including those described above. if we are unable to generate sufficient funds to service our outstanding indebtedness or to meet our working capital or other liquidity needs, including those described above, we would be required to refinance, restructure, or otherwise amend some or all of such indebtedness, sell assets, change or reduce our intended or announced uses or strategy for capital deployment, including, without limitation, for stock repurchases, reduce capital expenditures, planned expansions or other strategic initiatives, or raise additional cash through the sale of our equity or equity-related securities. we cannot make any assurances that any such refinancing, restructurings, amendments, sales of assets, or issuances of equity or equity-related securities can be accomplished or, if accomplished, will be on favorable terms or would raise sufficient funds to meet these obligations or our other liquidity needs. any failure to pay any of our indebtedness when due could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could trigger cross default or cross acceleration provisions in our other debt instruments, thereby permitting the holders of that other indebtedness to demand immediate repayment, and, in the case of secured indebtedness, to take possession of and sell the collateral securing such indebtedness to satisfy our obligations.
the borrowings under our current senior secured credit facilities and senior indentures are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries, and borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our and certain of our domestic subsidiaries' assets. such guarantees and the fact that we have pledged such assets may make it more difficult and expensive for us to make, or under certain circumstances could effectively prevent us from making, additional secured and unsecured borrowings.
we may be subject to liability claims for damages and other expenses that are not covered by insurance or exceed our existing insurance coverage that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.
our operations and how we manage our business may subject us, as well as our officers and directors to whom we owe certain defense and indemnity obligations, to litigation and liability for damages. our business, profitability and growth prospects could suffer if we face negative publicity or we pay damages or defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope or limits of coverage of any applicable insurance coverage, including, without limitation, claims related to adverse patient events, cybersecurity incidents, contractual disputes, antitrust and competition laws and regulations, professional and general liability and directors' and officers' duties. in addition, we have received notices of claims from commercial payors and other third parties, as well as subpoenas and cids from the federal government, related to our business practices, including, without limitation, our historical billing practices and the historical billing practices of acquired businesses. although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted, an adverse result with respect to one or more of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we maintain insurance coverage for those risks we deem are appropriate to insure against and make determinations about whether to self-insure as to other risks or layers of coverage. however, a successful claim, including, without limitation, a professional liability, malpractice or negligence claim or a claim related to a cybersecurity incident, which is in excess of any applicable insurance coverage, or that is subject to our self-insurance retentions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.
in addition, if our costs of insurance and claims increase, then our earnings could decline. market rates for insurance premiums and deductibles have been steadily increasing. our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following:
•   the collapse or insolvency of our insurance carriers;
•   further increases in premiums and deductibles;
•   increases in the number of liability claims against us or the cost of settling or trying cases related to those claims; or
•   an inability to obtain one or more types of insurance on acceptable terms, if at all.
expansion of our operations to and offering our services in markets outside of the u.s. subjects us to political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.
we are continuing to expand our operations by offering our services and entering new lines of business in certain markets outside of the u.s., which increases our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets. depending on the market, these risks include those relating to:
•   changes in the local economic environment;
•   political instability, armed conflicts or terrorism;
•   public health crises, such as pandemics or epidemics;
•   social changes;
•   intellectual property legal protections and remedies;
•   trade regulations;
•   procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of products and services;
•   foreign currency;
•   additional u.s. and foreign taxes;
•   export controls;
•   antitrust and competition laws and regulations;
•   lack of reliable legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce contractual rights;
•   changes in local laws or regulations, or interpretation or enforcement thereof;
•   potentially longer ramp-up times for starting up new operations and for payment and collection cycles;
•   financial and operational, and information technology systems integration;
•   failure to comply with u.s. laws, such as the fcpa, or local laws that prohibit us, our partners, or our partners' or our agents or intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials or any third party for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business; and
•   data and privacy restrictions.
issues relating to the failure to comply with applicable non-u.s. laws, requirements or restrictions may also impact our domestic business and/or raise scrutiny on our domestic practices.
additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international business and operations will be different than those affecting our domestic business and operations. for example, conducting international operations requires us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets, to comply with local laws and regulations, including to fulfill financial reporting requirements, and to overcome the numerous new challenges inherent in managing international operations, including, without limitation, challenges based on differing languages and cultures, challenges related to establishing clinical operations in differing regulatory and compliance environments, and challenges related to the timely hiring, integration and retention of a sufficient number of skilled personnel to carry out operations in an environment with which we are not familiar.
any expansion of our international operations through acquisitions or through organic growth could increase these risks. additionally, while we may invest material amounts of capital and incur significant costs in connection with the growth and development of our international operations, including to start up or acquire new operations, we may not be able to operate them profitably on the anticipated timeline, or at all.
these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and could materially harm our reputation.
delays in state medicare and medicaid certification, changes to other enrollment/provider requirements and/or anything impacting the licensing of our dialysis centers could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.
before we can begin billing for patients treated in our outpatient dialysis centers who are enrolled in government-based programs, we are required to obtain state and federal certification for participation in the medicare and medicaid programs. as state agencies responsible for surveying dialysis centers on behalf of the state and medicare program face increasing budgetary pressure, certain states are having difficulty keeping up with certifying dialysis centers in the normal course resulting in significant delays in certification. if state governments continue to have difficulty keeping up with certifying new centers in the normal course and we continue to experience significant delays in our ability to treat and bill for services provided to patients covered under government programs, it could cause us to incur write-offs of investments in the event we have to close centers or our centers' operating performance deteriorates, and it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the bba passed in february 2018 allows organizations approved by the hhs to accredit dialysis facilities and imposes certain timing requirements regarding the initiation of initial surveys to determine if certain conditions and requirements for payment have been satisfied. while we have made use of these hhs-approved parties for accreditation on a case-by-case basis, there can be no assurance that such changes will significantly reduce or eliminate certification and licensure delays over the long term. in addition to certifications for medicare and medicaid, some states have licensing requirements for esrd facilities. delays in licensure, denials of licensure, or withdrawal of licensure could also adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
in addition, in november 2019, cms finalized a provider enrollment rule creating new onerous disclosure obligations for all providers enrolled in medicare, medicaid and the children's health insurance plan (chip). the final rule imposes a stronger revocation authority and increases the bar for re-enrollment for providers who submit incomplete or inaccurate information or who have affiliations with other providers that cms has determined pose undue risk of fraud, waste or abuse. if we fail to comply with these and other applicable requirements on our licensure and certification programs, particularly in light of increased penalties that include a 10-year ban to re-enrollment, under certain circumstances it could have a material adverse on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.
if our joint ventures were found to violate the law, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
as of december 31, 2019, we owned a controlling interest in numerous dialysis-related joint ventures, which represented approximately 26% of our u.s. dialysis revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019. in addition, we also owned noncontrolling equity investments in several other dialysis related joint ventures. we expect to continue to increase the number of our joint ventures. many of our joint ventures with physicians or physician groups also have certain physician owners providing medical director services to centers we own and operate. because our relationships with physicians are governed by the federal and state anti-kickback statutes, we have sought to structure our joint venture arrangements to satisfy as many federal safe harbor requirements as we believe are commercially reasonable. our joint venture arrangements do not satisfy all of the elements of any safe harbor under the federal anti-kickback statute, however, and therefore are susceptible to government scrutiny. for example, in october 2014, we entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the then pending 2010 and 2011 u.s. attorney physician relationship investigations regarding certain of our joint ventures and paid $406 million in settlement amounts, civil forfeiture, and interest to the u.s. and certain states. for further details on the settlement agreement, see the risk factor under the heading "if we fail to adhere to all of the complex governmental laws, regulations and requirements that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could materially harm our reputation and stock price."
there are significant risks associated with estimating the amount of dialysis revenues and related refund liabilities that we recognize, and if our estimates of revenues and related refund liabilities are materially inaccurate, it could impact the timing and the amount of our revenues recognition or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
there are significant risks associated with estimating the amount of u.s. dialysis net patient services revenues and related refund liabilities that we recognize in a reporting period. the billing and collection process is complex due to ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage and other payor issues, such as ensuring appropriate documentation. determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for approximately 206,900 u.s. patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverage that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes. errors in determining the correct coordination of benefits may result in refunds to payors. revenues associated with medicare and medicaid programs are also subject to estimating risk related to the amounts not paid by the primary government payor that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage, the patient's commercial health plan secondary coverage or the patient. collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. we generally expect our range of u.s. dialysis net patient services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of net revenues for the segment. if our estimates of u.s. dialysis net patient services revenues and related refund liabilities are materially inaccurate, it could impact the timing and the amount of our revenues recognition and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including, without limitation, our international operations, that we operate or invest in now or in the future may generate losses and may ultimately be unsuccessful. in the event that one or more of these activities is unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be negatively impacted and we may have to write off our investment and incur other exit costs.
our ancillary services and strategic initiatives are subject to many of the same risks, regulations and laws, as described in the risk factors related to our dialysis business set forth in this part ii, item 1a, and are also subject to additional risks, regulations and laws specific to the nature of the particular strategic initiative. we expect to add additional service offerings to our business and pursue additional strategic initiatives in the future as circumstances warrant, which could include healthcare services not related to dialysis. many of these initiatives require or would require investments of both management and financial resources and can generate significant losses for a substantial period of time and may not become profitable in the expected timeframe or at all. there can be no assurance that any such strategic initiative will ultimately be successful. any significant change in market conditions, or business performance, or in the political, legislative or regulatory environment, may impact the economic viability of any of these strategic initiatives. for example, changes in the oral pharmacy space, including reimbursement rate pressures, negatively impacted the economics of our pharmacy services business. as a result, in the second half of 2018 we transitioned the customer service and fulfillment functions of this business to third parties and wound down our distribution operation, which resulted in a decrease in revenues and costs. in 2018, we recognized restructuring charges of $11 million and incurred asset impairment charges of $17 million related to the restructuring of our pharmacy business.
if any of our ancillary services or strategic initiatives, including our international operations, are unsuccessful, it would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and we may determine to exit that line of business. we could incur significant termination costs if we were to exit certain of these lines of business. in addition, we may incur a material write-off or an impairment of our investment, including, without limitation, goodwill or other assets, in one or more of our ancillary services or strategic initiatives. in that regard, we have taken, and may in the future take, impairment and restructuring charges in addition to those described above related to our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including, without limitation, in our international and pharmacy businesses.
if a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to law, rule or regulation, new competition, a perceived decrease in the quality of service levels at our centers or other reasons, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
physicians, including medical directors, choose where they refer their patients. some physicians prefer to have their patients treated at dialysis centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical director of the center. as a result, referral sources for many of our centers include the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center.
our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally ten years, and at any given time a large number of them could be up for renewal at the same time. medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us and, under certain circumstances, our former medical directors may choose to provide medical director services for competing providers or establish their own dialysis centers in competition with ours. neither our current nor former medical directors have an obligation to refer their patients to our centers. in addition, there are a number of new entrants into the dialysis space, and physicians, including medical directors, may refer patients to these new entrants rather than the company.
the aging of the nephrologist population and opportunities presented by our competitors may negatively impact a medical director's decision to enter into or extend his or her agreement with us. moreover, a perceived decrease in the quality of service levels at our centers or different affiliation models in the changing healthcare environment that limit a nephrologist's choice in where he or she can refer patients, such as an increase in the number of physicians becoming employed by hospitals, may limit a nephrologist's ability or desire to refer patients to our centers or otherwise negatively impact treatment volumes.
in addition, if the terms of any existing agreement are found to violate applicable laws, there can be no assurances that we would be successful in restructuring the relationship, which would lead to the early termination of the agreement. if we are unable to obtain qualified medical directors to provide supervision of the operations and care provided at our dialysis centers, it could affect physicians' desire to refer patients to our dialysis centers. if a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
if our labor costs continue to rise, including due to shortages, changes in certification requirements and higher than normal turnover rates in skilled clinical personnel; or currently pending or future rules, regulations, legislation or initiatives impose additional requirements or limitations on our operations or profitability; or, if we are unable to attract and retain key leadership talent, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses, among other things, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we face increasing labor costs generally, and in particular, we continue to face increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. we compete for nurses with hospitals and other healthcare providers. this nursing shortage may limit our ability to expand our operations. furthermore, changes in certification requirements can impact our ability to maintain sufficient staff levels, including to the extent our teammates are not able to meet new requirements, among other things. in addition, if we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for our skilled clinical personnel, our operations and treatment growth may be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we also face competition in attracting and retaining talent for key leadership positions. if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals, we may experience disruptions in our business operations, including, without limitation, our ability to achieve strategic goals, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
in addition, proposed ballot initiatives or referendums, legislation, regulations or policy changes could cause us to incur substantial costs to challenge and prepare for and, if implemented, impose additional requirements on our operations, including, without limitation, increases in the required staffing levels or staffing ratios for clinical personnel, minimum transition times between treatments, limits on how much patients may be charged for care, limitations as to the amount that can be spent on certain medical costs, and limitations on the amount of revenue that providers can retain. changes such as those mandated by proposed ballot initiatives or referendums, legislation, regulations or policy changes could materially reduce our revenues and increase our operating and other costs, require us to close or consolidate existing dialysis centers, postpone or not build new dialysis centers, reduce shifts or negatively impact employee relations, treatment growth and productivity, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additionally, there can be no assurances that we would be successful in staffing our clinics to any new, elevated staffing levels, in particular given the ongoing nationwide shortage of healthcare workers, especially nurses. for additional information on these risks, see the risk factor under the heading "changes in federal and state healthcare legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."
our business is labor intensive and could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain employees or if union organizing activities or legislative or other changes result in significant increases in our operating costs or decreases in productivity.
our business is labor intensive, and our financial and operating results have been and continue to be subject to variations in labor-related costs, productivity and the number of pending or potential claims against us related to labor and employment practices. political or other efforts at the national or local level could result in actions or proposals that increase the likelihood of success of union organizing activities at our facilities and ongoing union organizing activities at our facilities could continue or increase for other reasons. we could experience an upward trend in wages and benefits and labor and employment claims, including, without limitation, the filing of class action suits, or adverse outcomes of such claims, or face work stoppages. in addition, we are and may continue to be subject to targeted corporate campaigns by union organizers in response to which we have been and may continue to be required to expend substantial resources, both time and financial. any of these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our employee relations, treatment growth, productivity, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
failing to effectively maintain, operate or upgrade our information systems or those of third-party service providers upon which we rely, including, without limitation, our clinical, billing and collections systems could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
our business depends significantly on effective information systems. our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop or contract for new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, emerging cybersecurity risks and threats, evolving industry, legal and regulatory standards and requirements, and new models of care, and other changes in our business, among other things. there can be no assurances that we will ultimately realize anticipated benefits from investments in new or existing information systems. in addition, we may from time to time obtain significant portions of our systems-related support, technology or other services from independent third parties, which may make our operations vulnerable if such third parties fail to perform adequately.
failure to successfully implement, operate and maintain effective and efficient information systems with adequate technological capabilities, deficiencies or defects in the systems and related technology, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could result in competitive disadvantages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. for additional information on the risks we face in a highly competitive market, see the risk factor under the heading, "if we are unable to compete successfully, including, without limitation, implementing our growth strategy and/or retaining patients and physicians willing to serve as medical directors, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows." if the information we rely upon to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we or third parties on which we rely fail to adequately maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively, whether due to software deficiencies, human coding or implementation error or otherwise, we could experience difficulty meeting clinical outcome goals, face regulatory problems, including sanctions and penalties, incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could be material. moreover, failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems (including our networks) and data, or information systems and data hosted by third parties upon which we rely, could subject us to severe consequences as described in the risk factor under the heading "privacy and information security laws are complex, and if we fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf, or if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, protect our proprietary rights to our systems or defend against cybersecurity attacks, we may be subject to government or private actions due to privacy and security breaches, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or materially harm our reputation."
our billing system, among others, is critical to our billing operations. if there are defects in the billing system, or billing systems or services of third parties upon which we rely, we may experience difficulties in our ability to successfully bill and collect for services rendered, including, without limitation, a delay in collections, a reduction in the amounts collected, increased risk of retractions from and refunds to commercial and government payors, an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts receivable and noncompliance with reimbursement laws and related requirements, any or all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
in the clinical environment, a failure of our clinical systems, or the systems of our third-party service providers, to operate effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, the clinical care provided to patients, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. for example, in connection with claims for which at least part of the government's payments to us is based on clinical performance or patient outcomes or co-morbidities, if relevant clinical systems fail to accurately capture the data we report to cms or we otherwise have data integrity issues with respect to the reported information, this could impact our payments from government payors as well as our ability to retain funds paid to us based on the inaccurate information.
additionally, we expect the highly competitive environment in which we operate to become increasingly more competitive as the market evolves and new technologies are introduced. this dynamic environment requires continuous investment in new technologies and clinical applications. machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly driving innovations in technology, and parts of our operations may employ robotics. if these technologies or applications fail to operate as anticipated or do not perform as specified, including due to potential design defects and defects in the development of algorithms or other technologies, human error or otherwise, our clinical operations, business and reputation may be harmed. if we are unable to successfully maintain, operate or implement such technologies or applications in our clinical operations and laboratory, we may be, among other things, unable to efficiently adapt to evolving laws and requirements, unable to remain competitive with others who successfully implement and advance this technology, subject to increased risk under existing laws, regulations and requirements that apply to our business, and our patients' safety may be adversely impacted, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could materially harm our reputation. for additional detail, see the discussion in the risk factor under the heading "if we fail to adhere to all of the complex governmental laws, regulations and requirements that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could materially harm our reputation and stock price."
disruptions in federal government operations and funding create uncertainty in our industry and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
a substantial portion of our revenues is dependent on federal healthcare program reimbursement, and any disruptions in federal government operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. if the u.s. government defaults on its debt, there could be broad macroeconomic effects that could raise our cost of borrowing funds, and delay or prevent our future growth and expansion. any future federal government shutdown, u.s. government default on its debt and/or failure of the u.s. government to enact annual appropriations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additionally, disruptions in federal government operations may negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations, and create uncertainty about the pace of upcoming regulatory developments.
we could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.
we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the u.s. federal, state and local governments as well as various foreign jurisdictions. we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. as the tax rates vary among jurisdictions, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable or favorable change in our overall tax provision.
from time to time, changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability. there can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the u.s. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our patients, business partners and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
in addition, tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. we are regularly subject to audits by tax authorities. for example, we are currently under audit by the internal revenue service for the years 2014-2017, among other things. although we believe our tax estimates and related reporting are appropriate, the final determination of this and other tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. any changes in enacted tax laws (such as the recent u.s. tax legislation), rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations; any adverse development or outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction; or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, tax payments, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
laws regulating the corporate practice of medicine could restrict the manner in which our subsidiaries are permitted to conduct their business, and the failure to comply with such laws could subject these entities to penalties or require a restructuring of these businesses.
some states have laws that prohibit business entities, such as certain of our subsidiaries, including but not limited to, nephrology practice solutions, vively, villagehealth dm (davita ikc), and lifeline vascular access, from practicing medicine, employing physicians to practice medicine, exercising control over medical decisions by physicians (also known collectively as the corporate practice of medicine) or engaging in certain arrangements, such as fee-splitting, with physicians. in some states these prohibitions are expressly stated in a statute or regulation, while in other states the prohibition is a matter of judicial or regulatory interpretation. some of the states in which davita entities currently operate, generally prohibit the corporate practice of medicine, and other states may do so in the future as well. davita believes it has structured its entities appropriately; however, it is possible that a state regulatory agency or a court could determine davita and/or associated physician entities are in violation of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine. as a result, these arrangements could be deemed invalid, potentially resulting in a loss of revenues and an adverse effect on results of operations derived from these entities.
if we fail to successfully maintain an effective internal control over financial reporting, the integrity of our financial reporting could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to accurately report our financial results, the market's perception of our business and our stock price.
the integration of acquisitions and addition of new business lines into our internal control over financial reporting has required and will continue to require significant time and resources from our management and other personnel and has increased and will continue to, increase our compliance costs. failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to accurately report our financial results, the market's perception of our business and our stock price. in addition, we could be required to restate our financial results in the event of a significant failure of our internal control over financial reporting or in the event of inappropriate application of accounting principles.
deterioration in economic conditions, disruptions in the financial markets or the effects of natural or other disasters, political instability, public health crises or adverse weather events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires or flooding could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
deterioration in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. among other things, the potential decline in federal and state revenues that may result from such conditions may create additional pressures to contain or reduce reimbursements for our services from medicare, medicaid and other government sponsored programs. increases in job losses in the u.s. as a result of adverse economic conditions has and may continue to result in a smaller percentage of our patients being covered by an employer group health plan and a larger percentage being covered by lower paying medicare and medicaid programs. employers may also select more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates. to the extent that payors are negatively impacted by a decline in the economy, we may experience further pressure on commercial rates, a further slowdown in collections and a reduction in the amounts we expect to collect. in addition, uncertainty in the financial markets could adversely affect the variable interest rates payable under our credit facilities or could make it more difficult to obtain or renew such facilities or to obtain other forms of financing in the future, if at all. for additional information regarding the risks related to our indebtedness, see the discussion in the risk factor under the heading "the level of our current and future debt could have an adverse impact on our business, and our ability to generate cash to service our indebtedness and for other intended purposes depends on many factors beyond our control."
moreover, as of december 31, 2019, we had approximately $6.788 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. we account for impairments of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance, and record impairment charges when and to the extent a reporting unit's carrying amount is determined to exceed its estimated fair value. we use a variety of factors to assess changes in the financial condition, future prospects and other circumstances concerning our businesses and to estimate their fair value when applicable. these assessments and the related valuations can involve significant uncertainties and require significant judgment on various matters, some of which could be subject to reasonable disagreement.
should our revenues and financial results be materially, unfavorably impacted due to, among other things, a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the united states that negatively impacts reimbursement rates or the availability of insurance coverage for our patients, we may incur future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.
further, some of our operations, including our clinical laboratory, dialysis centers and other facilities, may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural or other disasters, political instability, public health crises such as global pandemics or epidemics, or adverse weather events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires or flooding. patients with chronic illness may be more susceptible to epidemics or other public health crises. any such event or other occurrence that results in a failure of the fitness of our clinical laboratory, dialysis centers and related operations and/or other facilities or otherwise adversely impacts the safety of our teammates or patients at any of those locations could lead us to face adverse consequences, including, without limitation, compliance or regulatory investigations, any of which could materially impact our business, results of operation and financial condition, and could materially harm our reputation. for example, our clinical laboratory is located in florida, a state that has in the past experienced and may in the future experience hurricanes. natural or other disasters or adverse weather events could significantly damage or destroy our facilities, disrupt operations, increase our costs to maintain operations and require substantial expenditures and recovery time to fully resume operations. in addition, our presence in markets outside the u.s. may increase our exposure to certain risks related to such natural disasters, public health crises, political instability or other catastrophic event outside our control. for additional information regarding the risks related to our international business, see the discussion in the risk factor under the heading "expansion of our operations to and offering our services in markets outside of the u.s. subjects us to political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation."
any or all of these factors, as well as other consequences of these events, none of which we can currently predict, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or materially harm our reputation.
provisions in our charter documents, compensation programs and delaware law may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests.
our charter documents include provisions that may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. these include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent; requiring 90 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our board of directors (or 120 days for nominations made using proxy access); and granting our board of directors the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval.
most of our outstanding employee stock-based compensation awards include a provision accelerating the vesting of the awards in the event of a change of control. these and any other change of control provisions may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay for our company.
we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law that, subject to exceptions, would prohibit us from engaging in any business combinations with any interested stockholder, as defined in that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested stockholder.
these provisions may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of our company at a price that our stockholders may find attractive. these provisions could also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.
item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k, including this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, contains statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. all statements in this report, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. without limiting the foregoing, statements including the words "expect," "intend," "will," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," "forecast," "guidance," "outlook," "goals," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include but are not limited to statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, such as expectations for operating cash flow, estimated charges and accruals, the development of new dialysis centers and dialysis center acquisitions or other new service offerings, government and commercial payment rates, and our stock repurchase program. our actual results and other events could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to numerous factors that involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties. these risks and uncertainties include, among other things:
•   the concentration of profits generated by higher-paying commercial payor plans for which there is continued downward pressure on realized payment rates, and a reduction in the number of patients under such plans, including as a result of restrictions or prohibitions on the use and/or availability of charitable premium assistance, which may result in the loss of revenues or patients, or our making incorrect assumptions about how our patients will respond to any change in financial assistance from charitable organizations;
•   the extent to which the ongoing implementation of healthcare reform, or changes in or new legislation, regulations or guidance, enforcement thereof or related litigation result in a reduction in coverage or reimbursement rates for our services, a reduction in the number of patients enrolled in higher-paying commercial plans, or other material impacts to our business; or our making incorrect assumptions about how our patients will respond to any such developments;
•   a reduction in government payment rates under the medicare end stage renal disease program or other government-based programs and the impact of the medicare advantage benchmark structure;
•   risks arising from potential and proposed federal and/or state legislation, regulation, ballot, executive action or other initiatives, including such initiatives related to healthcare and/or labor matters;
•   the impact of the political environment and related developments on the current healthcare marketplace and on our business, including with respect to the future of the affordable care act, the exchanges and many other core aspects of the current healthcare marketplace;
•   our ability to successfully implement our strategy with respect to home-based dialysis, including maintaining our existing business and further developing our capabilities in a complex and highly regulated environment;
•   changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns, reimbursement and payment policies and processes, or pharmaceutical pricing, including with respect to calcimimetics;
•   legal and compliance risks, such as our continued compliance with complex government regulations;
•   continued increased competition from dialysis providers and others, and other potential marketplace changes;
•   our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, changing affiliation models for physicians, and the emergence of new models of care introduced by the government or private sector that may erode our patient base and reimbursement rates, such as accountable care organizations, independent practice associations and integrated delivery systems;
•   our ability to complete acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might announce or be considering, on terms favorable to us or at all, or to integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire or have acquired, or to successfully expand our operations and services in markets outside the united states, or to businesses outside of dialysis;
•   uncertainties related to potential payments and/or adjustments under certain provisions of the equity purchase agreement for the sale of our davita medical group (dmg) business, such as post-closing adjustments and indemnification obligations;
•   noncompliance by us or our business associates with any privacy or security laws or any security breach by us or a third party involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information;
•   the variability of our cash flows; the risk that we may not be able to generate sufficient cash in the future to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs; and the risk that we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due, on terms favorable to us or at all;
•   factors that may impact our ability to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and the timing of any such stock repurchases, as well as our use of a considerable amount of available funds to repurchase stock;
•   risks arising from the use of accounting estimates, judgments and interpretations in our financial statements;
•   impairment of our goodwill, investments or other assets;
•   uncertainties related to our use of the proceeds from the dmg sale transaction and other available funds, including external financing and cash flow from operations, which may be or have been used in ways that we cannot assure will improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock; and
•   uncertainties associated with the other risk factors set forth in part i, item 1a. of this annual report on form 10-k, and the other risks and uncertainties discussed in any subsequent reports that we file or furnish with the sec from time to time.
the forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these risks and uncertainties. all forward-looking statements in this report are based solely on information available to us on the date of this report. we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changed circumstances, new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements.
company overview our principal business is to provide dialysis and related lab services to patients in the united states, which we refer to as our u.s. dialysis business. we also operate various ancillary services and strategic initiatives including our international operations, which we collectively refer to as our ancillary services, as well as our corporate administrative support. our u.s. dialysis business is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services in the u.s. for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as end stage renal disease (esrd).
on june 19, 2019, we completed the sale of our davita medical group (dmg) business to collaborative care holdings, llc (optum), a subsidiary of unitedhealth group inc. as a result of this transaction, dmg's results of operations have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented and dmg is not included below in this management's discussion and analysis.
our overall financial performance in 2019 benefited from increased treatment volume from acquired and non-acquired growth in both our u.s. dialysis and international businesses and a corresponding increase in revenue, as well as improved operating margins due to a decrease in the cost of calcimimetics from the introduction of lower cost oral generics, a decrease in other pharmaceutical unit costs, and a decrease in advocacy costs as compared to the prior year. this was partially offset by increases in labor and benefits costs, other center related costs, a decrease in revenues from the closure of our pharmaceutical business in 2018. the year-over-year comparison was also adversely impacted by $36 million of additional medicare bad debt revenue recognized in 2018 due to a policy election on adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard.
drivers of our financial performance in 2019 included the following:
•   improved key clinical outcomes in our u.s. dialysis business, including our recognition as an industry leader for the seventh consecutive year in cms' quality incentive program and for the last six years under the cms five-star quality rating system;
•   u.s. dialysis revenue growth of 2.2% and international revenue growth of 13.6%;
•   a year-over-year increase in our normalized non-acquired u.s. dialysis treatment growth of 2.2%, which contributed to an increase of approximately 2.5% in our overall u.s. dialysis treatment count for 2019;
•   a net increase of 89 u.s. and 18 international dialysis centers;
•   operating cash flows of $2.0 billion from continuing operations;
•   a $174 million or 19.3% reduction in routine maintenance and development capital expenditures from continuing operations, consistent with our capital efficient growth strategies;
•   repurchase of 41,020,232 shares of our common stock for aggregate consideration of $2.4 billion and reduction of our share count by approximately 24.4% year-over-year; and
•   entry into a new $5.5 billion senior secured credit agreement and redemption of our 5.75% senior notes.
in 2020, we expect the fundamentals of our u.s. dialysis business to generally be similar to the dynamics that we faced in 2019. on treatment volume, we continue to face pressure due to slowing industry growth as well as competitive activity. on reimbursement rate, we expect modest growth in aggregate, primarily due to the expected net market basket update for medicare treatments. on cost, we continue to expect inflationary pressure on wage rates and other costs, offset by continued savings on drug costs. we expect to continue making investments to grow our home-based dialysis services in 2020. we anticipate two notable differences in 2020 versus 2019 - we expect to generate significantly less income on calcimimetics due to expected decreases in medicare reimbursement throughout 2020, and we plan to incur costs in 2020, which could be significant, to counter a proposed union-backed ballot initiative in california.
the discussion below includes analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018. our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018, includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2017, in part ii item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations".

u.s. dialysis business our u.s. dialysis business is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services, operating 2,753 outpatient dialysis centers, serving a total of approximately 206,900 patients. we also provide acute inpatient dialysis services in approximately 900 hospitals. we estimate that we have approximately a 38% share of the u.s. dialysis market based upon the number of patients we serve.
approximately 92% of our 2019 consolidated revenues were derived directly from our u.s. dialysis business. the principal drivers of our u.s. dialysis revenues include    :
•   the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three treatments per week, as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis, home dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis; and
•   average dialysis net patient service revenue per treatment, including the mix of commercial and government patients.
within our u.s. dialysis business, our home-based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services are operationally integrated with our outpatient dialysis centers and related laboratory services. our outpatient, home-based, and hospital inpatient dialysis services comprise approximately 78%, 16% and 6% of our u.s. dialysis revenues, respectively.
in the u.s., government dialysis-related payment rates are principally determined by federal medicare and state medicaid policy. for 2019, approximately 69% of our total u.s. dialysis patient services revenues were generated from government-based programs for services to approximately 90% of our total patients. these government-based programs are principally medicare and medicare-assigned, medicaid and managed medicaid plans, and other government plans, representing approximately 59%, 6% and 4% of our u.s. dialysis patient services revenues, respectively.
dialysis payment rates from commercial payors vary and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. on average, dialysis-related payment rates from contracted commercial payors are significantly higher than medicare, medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients in relation to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis net patient service revenue per treatment. commercial payors (including hospital dialysis services) represent approximately 31% of u.s. dialysis patient services revenues. over the last two years, we have seen a slight decline in the growth of our commercial patients, which has been outpaced by the growth of our government-based patients.
for further discussion of government reimbursement, the medicare esrd bundled payment system and commercial reimbursement, see the discussion in item 1. business under the heading "u.s. dialysis business - sources of revenue-concentrations and risks." for a discussion of operational, clinical and financial risks and uncertainties that we face in connection with the medicare esrd bundled payment system, see the risk factor in item 1a. risk factors under the heading "changes in the structure of and payment rates under the medicare esrd program could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows." for a discussion of operational, clinical and financial risks and uncertainties that we face in connection with commercial payors, see the risk factors in item 1a. risk factors under the headings "if the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly or if patients in commercial plans are subject to restriction in plan designs, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows"; and "if the number of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."
the impact of physician-prescribed pharmaceuticals on our overall revenues that are separately billable has significantly decreased since medicare's single bundled payment system went into effect beginning in january 2011, and as a result of commercial contracts that pay us a single bundled payment rate.
effective january 1, 2018, both oral and intravenous forms of calcimimetics, a drug class taken by many patients with esrd to treat mineral bone disorder, became the financial responsibility of our u.s. dialysis business for our medicare patients and are now reimbursed under medicare part b. previously, calcimimetics were reimbursed for medicare patients through part d once dispensed from traditional pharmacies. currently, the oral and intravenous forms of calcimimetics remain separately reimbursed and therefore are not part of the esrd prospective payment system (pps) bundled payment. during the initial pass-through period, medicare payment for calcimimetics was based on a pass-through rate of the average sales price plus approximately 6% before sequestration (or 4% adjusted for sequestration), however, in 2020 calcimimetics are reimbursed at average sales price plus 0% before sequestration. cms has stated intentions to enter calcimimetics into the esrd bundled payment as of january 1, 2021. we do not know the rate at which cms will include calcimimetics into the bundle. if there is a reduction from the current amount of reimbursement or if cms fails to increase the bundle in a sufficient manner to appropriately and adequately reimburse for the drug, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, during the period in which we are separately reimbursed for calcimimetics, we expect our average revenue per treatment related to these pharmaceuticals to decline in future periods as cms adjusts the reimbursement amount to more closely match the cost of these pharmaceuticals in accordance with their rules. we therefore expect to realize significantly reduced levels of operating income from calcimimetics in the future as compared to 2019.
approximately 6% and 7% of our total u.s. dialysis net patient services revenues for the years 2019 and 2018, respectively, are associated with the administration of separately-billable physician-prescribed pharmaceuticals, of which approximately 4% and 5% relate to the administration of calcimimetics, respectively.
we anticipate that we will continue to experience increases in our operating costs in 2020 that may outpace any net medicare rate increases that we may receive, which could significantly impact our operating results. in particular, we expect to continue experiencing increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, including increases in maintenance costs, regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation-based increase in medicare payment rates or in payments under the esrd bundled payment rate system. we also expect to continue to incur capital expenditures to improve, renovate and maintain our facilities, equipment and information technology to meet evolving regulatory requirements and otherwise.
u.s. dialysis patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers, home-based programs and hospital inpatient programs, and consist principally of labor, benefits, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and other operating costs of the dialysis centers.
the principal drivers of our u.s. dialysis patient care costs include:
•   clinical hours per treatment, labor rates and benefit costs;
•   vendor pricing and utilization levels of pharmaceuticals;
•   business infrastructure costs, which include the operating costs of our dialysis centers; and
•   certain professional fees.
other cost categories that can present significant variability include employee benefit costs, insurance costs and medical supply costs. in addition, proposed ballot initiatives or referendums, legislation, regulations or policy changes could cause us to incur substantial costs for related advocacy or to prepare for, or implement changes required. any such changes could result in, among other things, increases in our labor costs or limitations on the amount of revenue that we can retain. for additional detail on risks associated with potential and proposed ballot initiatives, referendums, legislation, regulations or policy changes, see the risk factor in item 1a. risk factors under the heading, "changes in federal and state healthcare legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."
our average clinical hours per treatment decreased in 2019 compared to 2018. we are always striving for improved productivity levels, however, changes in things such as federal and state policies or regulatory billing requirements can lead to increased labor costs. improvements in the u.s. economy have stimulated additional competition for skilled clinical personnel resulting in slightly higher clinical teammate turnover over the last few years, which we believe has negatively affected productivity levels. in both 2019 and 2018, we experienced an increase in our clinical labor rates of approximately 2.0% and 3.0%, respectively, consistent with general industry trends. we also continue to experience increases in the infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new dialysis centers opened, and general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. in 2019, we continued to implement certain cost control initiatives to help manage our overall operating costs, including labor productivity.
our u.s. dialysis general and administrative expenses represented 8.1% of our u.s. dialysis revenues in both 2019 and 2018. increases in general and administrative expenses over the last several years were primarily related to strengthening our dialysis business and related compliance and operational processes, responding to certain legal and compliance matters, professional fees associated with enhancing our information technology systems and more recent costs to counter union policy efforts. we expect these levels of general and administrative expenses will continue in 2020 and could possibly increase as we seek out new business opportunities and continue to invest in improving our information technology infrastructure and maintain our regulatory compliance program, among other things. in addition, our general administrative expenses could increase in 2020 as compared to the prior year due to additional anticipated advocacy costs to challenge ballot initiatives, which could be significant.

u.s. dialysis revenues increased primarily due to volume growth from additional treatments of 2.5% due to an increase in acquired and non-acquired treatments. our u.s. dialysis revenues were negatively impacted by a decrease in our average net patient service revenue per treatment due to a rate decline related to calcimimetics which was partially offset by an increase in medicare rates in 2019. in addition, 2018 was favorably impacted by $36 million of additional medicare bad debt revenue due to a policy election made in 2018 under the new revenue recognition accounting standards.

patient care costs. u.s. dialysis patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor, benefits, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and other operating costs of the dialysis centers.
u.s. dialysis patient care costs per treatment decreased primarily due to a decrease in calcimimetics unit costs as oral generic products have entered the market lowering the cost of products we acquire, as well as decreases in other pharmaceutical unit costs. these decreases were partially offset by increases in benefits costs and other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers.
general and administrative expenses. u.s. dialysis general and administrative expenses in 2019 increased primarily due to increases in labor and benefit costs, and long-term incentive compensation expense driven by compensation plans based on operating income performance. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in advocacy costs to oppose certain legislative and ballot initiatives as well as a decline in asset impairments related to expected center closures.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization expense is directly impacted by the number of dialysis centers we develop and acquire. u.s. dialysis depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to growth in the number of dialysis centers we operate, as well as additional informational technology initiatives.
equity investment income. u.s. dialysis equity investment income increased primarily due to an increase in the profitability at certain joint ventures, as well as an increase in the number of our nonconsolidated dialysis joint ventures.
gain on changes in ownership interests, net. during 2018, we acquired a controlling interest in a previously nonconsolidated dialysis partnership. as a result of this transaction, we consolidated this partnership and recognized a non-cash gain of $28 million on our previously held ownership interest in the partnership.

u.s. dialysis operating income and adjusted operating income in 2019 increased as compared to the prior year due to an increase in our margin on calcimimetics, treatment growth and medicare rates, as described above, as well as decreases in advocacy costs and other pharmaceutical unit costs. these increases were partially offset by increases in other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, labor and benefits costs and long-term compensation expense.

other - ancillary services our other operations include ancillary services which are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients. as of december 31, 2019, these consisted primarily of integrated care and disease management (davita ikc), esrd seamless care organizations (escos), clinical research programs (davita clinical research), vascular access services, physician services, and comprehensive kidney care (vively health formerly known as davita health solutions), as well as our international operations. these ancillary services, including our international operations, generated approximately $972 million of revenues in 2019, representing approximately 8% of our consolidated revenues. as further described in the risk factor in item 1a. risk factors under the heading, "our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including, without limitation, our international operations, that we operate or invest in now or in the future may generate losses and may ultimately be unsuccessful. in the event that one or more of these activities is unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be negatively impacted and we may have to write off our investment and incur other exit costs," if any of our ancillary services or strategic initiatives, such as our international operations, are unsuccessful, it could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and we may determine to exit that line of business, which could result in significant termination costs. in addition, we have in the past and may in the future incur a material write-off or an impairment of our investment, including goodwill, in one or more of these ancillary services. in that regard, we may in the future incur impairment and restructuring charges in addition to those incurred by our pharmacy business in 2018, described below.
we expect to add additional service offerings to our business and pursue additional strategic initiatives in the future as circumstances warrant, which could include healthcare services not related to dialysis.
as of december 31, 2019, our international dialysis operations provided dialysis and administrative services through a network of 259 outpatient dialysis centers located in ten countries outside of the u.s. for 2019, total revenues generated from our international operations were approximately 4% of our consolidated revenues.

revenues:
u.s. ancillary services revenues decreased due to the closure of our pharmacy distribution operations in 2018 and the sale of our primary care business in the second quarter of 2018, as well as decreases in revenues at vively health, our esco joint ventures and davita clinical research. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues at davita ikc,
58
primarily due to an increase in special needs plans revenues. in addition, international revenues increased due to acquired and non-acquired treatment growth as we continue to expand internationally.
charges impacting operating income:
goodwill impairment charges. during the first and third quarter of 2019, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $41 million and $79 million, respectively, in our german kidney care business. the first quarter charge resulted primarily from a change in relevant discount rates, as well as a decline in current and expected future patient census and an increase in first quarter and expected future costs, principally due to wage increases expected to result from recently announced legislation. the third quarter incremental charge recognized in the germany kidney care business resulted from changes and developments in our outlook for this business since our last assessment. these primarily concern developments in the business in response to evolving market conditions and changes in our expected timing and ability to mitigate them.
during 2019 and 2018, we also recognized goodwill impairment charges of $5 million and $3 million, respectively, at our german other health operations. see further discussion of these impairment charges and our reporting units that remain at risk of goodwill impairment in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
restructuring charges and other impairments. during 2018, we announced a plan to restructure our pharmacy business due to changes in the oral pharmacy space, including reimbursement rate pressures that negatively affected the economics of our pharmacy services business. this included transitioning the customer service and fulfillment functions of this business to third parties and closing our distribution operation, which resulted in a decline in revenues and costs in 2018. as a result of this closure, in 2018 we recognized restructuring charges of $11 million and asset impairment charges of $17 million related to the restructuring of our pharmacy business.
gain on changes in ownership interests, net. effective june 1, 2018, we sold 100% of the stock of paladina health, our direct primary care business and recognized a gain of approximately $34 million on this transaction. in addition, we recognized a loss of approximately $1 million related to the unwinding of an international business in the second quarter of 2018.
operating loss and adjusted operating loss:
u.s. ancillary services operating loss was impacted by the charges discussed above, in addition to an equity investment loss on the sale of our india business in our apac jv of $9 million and an equity investment loss of $8 million related to impairments at our apac jv. both u.s. ancillary services operating loss and adjusted operating loss were impacted by a decrease related to our pharmacy distribution ceasing operations in 2018, as described above, and increases in operating results for davita ikc and davita clinical research, partially offset by decreases in operating results at vively health and at our esco joint ventures. international operating losses increased due to the goodwill impairment in our germany businesses. international adjusted operating results improved over 2018 due to growth in our international business and benefited from cost efficiencies implemented.
corporate administrative support corporate administrative support consists primarily of labor, benefits and long-term incentive compensation expense, as well as professional fees for departments which provide support to all of our various operating lines of business. these expenses are partially offset by internal management fees charged to our other lines of business for that support. corporate administrative support expenses are included in general and administrative expenses on our consolidated income statement.
corporate administrative support expenses increased $2 million or 2.2% in 2019 primarily due to a reduction in internal management fees charged to our pharmacy business which ceased operations in 2018. this increase was offset by a decrease in long-term incentive compensation expense in 2019 resulting from the adoption of a retirement policy for certain officers of the company in 2018.

(1)   for a reconciliation of effective income tax rate from continuing operations attributable to davita inc., see "reconciliations of non-gaap measures" section below.
debt expense debt expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in our outstanding debt balance, partially offset by an increase in the overall weighted average effective interest rate on our debt in 2019. our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2019 was 5.01% compared to 4.96% in 2018. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on components of our debt.
debt prepayment, refinancing and redemption charges we incurred debt prepayment, refinancing and redemption charges of $33 million in 2019 as a result of the repayment of all principal balances outstanding on our prior senior secured credit facilities and the redemption of our 5.75% senior notes. this consisted of $21 million recognized in the third quarter of 2019 related to debt discount and deferred financing cost write-offs associated with the portion of our prior senior secured debt that was paid in full and redemption charges on our 5.75% senior notes, as well as $12 million recognized in the second quarter of 2019 related to the accelerated amortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs associated with the portion of our prior senior secured debt that was mandatorily prepaid in or shortly after the second quarter of 2019 using proceeds from the sale of dmg and prior extensions of that debt.
other income other income consists primarily of interest income on cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments, realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized on investments, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. other income increased in 2019 primarily due to the increase in our holdings of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in 2019.
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate and effective income tax rate from continuing operations attributable to davita inc. decreased in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in our estimated blended state tax rate and the lower nondeductible advocacy costs in 2019 as compared to the costs incurred in 2018 to oppose certain legislative and ballot initiatives.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests the increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to improved earnings at certain u.s. dialysis partnerships and an increase in the number of such partnerships.
reconciliations of non-gaap measures the following tables provide reconciliations of adjusted operating income to operating income as presented on a u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) basis for our u.s. dialysis reportable segment as well as for our u.s. ancillary services, our international business, and for our total ancillary services which combines them and is disclosed as our other segments category. these non-gaap or "adjusted" measures are presented because management believes these measures are useful adjuncts to, but not alternatives for, our gaap results.
60
specifically, management uses adjusted operating income to compare and evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. we believe this non-gaap measure is also useful to investors and analysts in evaluating our performance over time and relative to competitors, as well as in analyzing the underlying trends in our business. we also believe this presentation enhances a user's understanding of our normal operating income by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations.
in addition, our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations attributable to davita inc. excludes noncontrolling owners' income, which primarily relates to non-tax paying entities. we believe this adjusted effective income tax rate is useful to management, investors and analysts in evaluating our performance and establishing expectations for income taxes incurred on our ordinary results attributable to davita inc.
it is important to bear in mind that these non-gaap "adjusted" measures are not measures of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation from, nor as substitutes for, their most comparable gaap measures.

accounts receivable our consolidated accounts receivable balances at december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, were $1.796 billion and $1.859 billion, respectively, representing approximately 58 days and 62 days of revenue (dso), respectively, net of the allowance for uncollectible accounts. the decrease in consolidated dso was primarily due to a decrease of two days of dso in our u.s. dialysis business primarily due to improved collections related to certain payors as well as improved dso at our international operations. our dso calculation is based on the current quarter's average revenues per day. there were no significant changes during 2019 from 2018 in the amount of unreserved accounts receivable over one year old or the amounts pending approval from third-party payors.
as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, our net patient services accounts receivable balances that are more than six months old represents approximately 18% of our dialysis accounts receivable balances. substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. there were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. less than 1% of our revenues are classified as patient pay.
amounts pending approval from third-party payors associated with medicare bad debt claims as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, other than the standard monthly billing, consisted of approximately $138 million and $136 million, respectively, and are classified as other receivables. a significant portion of our medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims but are subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of these audits. such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed.

consolidated cash flows consolidated cash flows from operating activities for 2019 were $2,072 million, of which $1,973 million was from continuing operations, compared with consolidated operating cash flows for the same period in 2018 of $1,772 million, of which $1,481 million was from continuing operations. the increase in cash flow from continuing operations was primarily driven by an increase in operating income in 2019 as compared to 2018, driven by decreases in pharmaceutical and advocacy costs, as well as a decrease in dso of approximately four days and cash tax payments.
cash flows from investing activities in 2019 increased $4,001 million compared to 2018 primarily due to the net cash proceeds received from the dmg sale, which closed in june 2019, as well as a decrease in capital and acquisition expenditures. we developed 38 fewer centers and acquired 23 fewer centers in 2019 compared to 2018. see below for additional information regarding the growth in our dialysis centers.
cash flows used in financing activities increased $4,071 million in 2019 compared to 2018. significant financing activities included net payments of $2,080 million on debt during 2019. net debt payments primarily consisted of principal prepayments totaling $5,142 million on our term debt under our prior senior secured credit facility funded primarily by the net proceeds from the dmg sale and the redemption of all of our outstanding 5.75% senior notes due in 2022 for an aggregate cash payment consisting of principal and redemption premium of $1,262 million, partially offset by funding of our term debt of $4,500 million under our new senior secured credit facility. in addition, we incurred deferred financing costs related to our new
63
term debt and a cap premium fee for our forward interest rate cap agreements. by comparison, 2018 included net advances of $695 million, which included a $995 million draw on our prior term loan a-2 and net payments of $125 million on our prior revolving line of credit, net of scheduled principal payments on our term debt under our prior senior secured credit facility. see further discussion in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements related to debt activities. cash flows used for share repurchases increased in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to our modified dutch auction tender offer (tender offer). see below for further information on our share repurchases.

(1)   the amount paid for shares repurchased associated with our tender offer during the year ended december 31, 2019 includes the clearing price of $56.50 per share plus related fees and expenses of $2 million.
subsequent to december 31, 2019, we have repurchased 290,904 shares of our common stock for $22 million at an average cost of $74.92 per share from january 1, 2020 through february 20, 2020. we retired all shares of common stock held in treasury effective december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018.
see further discussion in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
available liquidity as of december 31, 2019, our cash balance was $1.102 billion and we had approximately $12 million in short-term investments. as of december 31, 2019, we also had an undrawn $1.0 billion revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facilities, of which approximately $13 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. we also have approximately $60 million of additional outstanding letters of credit under a separate bilateral secured letter of credit facility.
see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for components of our long-term debt and their interest rates.
we believe that our cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, including from amounts available under our new senior secured credit facilities and our access to the capital markets, will be sufficient to fund our scheduled debt service

under the terms of our debt agreements and other obligations for the foreseeable future, including the next 12 months. our primary recurrent sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings, which are subject to general, economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, as described in item 1a risk factors under the heading "the level of our current and future debt could have an adverse impact on our business, and our ability to generate cash to service our indebtedness and for other intended purposes depends on many factors beyond our control."
off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations in addition to the debt obligations and operating lease liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with letters of credit, as well as potential obligations associated with our equity investments in nonconsolidated businesses and to dialysis ventures that are wholly-owned by third parties. we have potential obligations to purchase the noncontrolling interests held by third parties in many of our majority-owned partnerships and other nonconsolidated entities. these obligations are in the form of put provisions that are exercisable at the third-party owners' discretion within specified periods as outlined in each specific put provision. if these put provisions were exercised, we would be required to purchase the third-party owners' equity interests, generally at the appraised fair market value of the equity interests or in certain cases at a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flows attributable to the equity interests put to us, intended to approximate fair value. the methodology we use to estimate the fair values of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions assumes the higher of either a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings, based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators that can affect future results, as well as other factors. the estimated fair values of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions are a critical accounting estimate that involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. the estimated fair values of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary significantly depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers' access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non-dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third-party owners' equity interests. the amount of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions that employ a contractually predetermined multiple of earnings rather than fair value are immaterial. for additional information see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
we also have certain other potential commitments to provide operating capital to several dialysis businesses that are wholly-owned by third parties or in which we own a noncontrolling equity interest as well as to physician-owned vascular access clinics or medical practices that we operate under management and administrative services agreements.
the following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2019:

in 2017, the company entered into a sourcing and supply agreement with amgen usa inc. (amgen) that expires on december 31, 2022. under the terms of the agreement, the company will purchase epo from amgen in amounts necessary to meet no less than 90% of its requirements for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (esas) through the expiration of the contract. the actual amount of epo that the company will purchase will depend upon the amount of epo administered during dialysis as prescribed by physicians and the overall number of patients that the company serves.
the company has an agreement with fresenius medical care (fmc) to purchase a certain amount of dialysis equipment, parts and supplies from fmc, which extends through december 31, 2020. the company also has agreements with baxter healthcare corporation (baxter) that commit the company to purchase certain amounts of dialysis supplies at fixed prices through 2022. if the company fails to meet the minimum purchase commitments under these contracts during any year, it is required to pay the difference to the supplier.
settlements of approximately $83 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, penalties and other long-term tax liabilities, are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made.
contingencies the information in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report is incorporated by reference in response to this item.
critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles. these accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, contingencies and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions (redeemable equity interests). all significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. actual results will generally differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on-going actual experience trends or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of goodwill, accounting for income taxes, and fair value estimates are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. for additional information, see part ii item 15, "exhibits, financial statement schedules" - note 1 - "organization and summary of significant accounting policies" as referred from part ii item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
u.s. dialysis revenue recognition and accounts receivable. there are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of u.s. dialysis revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. in addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters.
revenues associated with medicare and medicaid programs are recognized based on (a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs providing secondary coverage (e.g., medicaid secondary coverage), the patient's commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. our dialysis related reimbursements from medicare are subject to certain variations under medicare's single bundled payment rate system whereby our reimbursements can be adjusted for certain patient characteristics and other variable factors. our revenue recognition depends upon our ability to effectively capture, document and bill for medicare's base payment rate and these other factors. in addition, as a result of the potential range of variations that can occur in our dialysis-related reimbursements from medicare under the single bundled payment rate system, our revenue recognition is subject to a greater degree of estimating risk.
commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed-care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients covered under commercial healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non-contracted commercial healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, the estimated timing of collections, changes in our expectations of the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance matters. determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our approximately 206,900 u.s. dialysis patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes. collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided.
we generally expect the range of our u.s. dialysis revenue estimating risk to be within 1% of revenue, which can represent as much as approximately 5% of our u.s. dialysis business's adjusted operating income. changes in estimates are reflected in the then-current financial statements based on on-going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant.
revenues for laboratory services, which are integrally related to our dialysis services, are recognized in the period services are provided at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received.
impairments of goodwill. we account for impairments of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. goodwill is not amortized, but is assessed for impairment when changes in circumstances warrant and at least annually. an impairment charge is recorded when and to the extent a reporting unit's carrying amount is determined to exceed its estimated fair value.
changes in circumstance that may trigger a goodwill impairment assessment for one of our business units can include, among others, changes in the legal environment, addressable market, business strategy, development or business plans, reimbursement structure, operating performance, future prospects, relationships with partners, and/or market value indications for the subject business. we use a variety of factors to assess changes in the financial condition, future prospects and other circumstances concerning the subject businesses and to estimate their fair value when applicable. any change in the factors, assessments or assumptions involved could affect a determination of whether and when to assess goodwill for impairment as well as the outcome of such an assessment. these assessments and the related valuations can involve significant uncertainties and require significant judgment on various matters, some of which could be subject to reasonable disagreement.
accounting for income taxes. our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous state and foreign jurisdictions, and changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability. the actual impact of any such laws or regulations could be materially different from our current estimates.
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated income tax expense. deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, results of recent operations, and assumptions about the amount of future federal, state, and foreign pre-tax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgments and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. the allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets.
fair value estimates. the fasb defines fair value generally as the amount at which an asset (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or sold (or settled) in a current transaction between willing parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. it also defines fair value more specifically for most purposes as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
we rely on fair value measurements and estimates for purposes that require the recording, reassessment, or adjustment of the carrying amounts of certain assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions (redeemable equity interests). these purposes can include purchase accounting for business combination transactions; impairment assessments for goodwill, other intangible assets, and other long-lived assets; recurrent revaluation of investments in debt and equity securities, interest rate cap agreements or other derivative instruments, contingent earn-out obligations, and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions; and the accounting for equity method and other investments and stock-based compensation, among others. the criticality of a particular fair value estimate to our consolidated financial statements depends upon the nature and size of the item being measured, the extent of uncertainties involved and the nature and magnitude or potential effect of assumptions and judgments required. critical fair value estimates can involve significant uncertainties and require significant judgment on various matters, some of which could be subject to reasonable disagreement.
loss contingencies.  as discussed in notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, we operate in a highly regulated industry and are party to various lawsuits, claims, qui tam suits, governmental investigations and audits (including investigations resulting from our obligation to self-report suspected violations of law), contract disputes and other legal proceedings. assessments of such matters can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. we record accruals for loss contingencies on such matters to the extent that we determine an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion. as described in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, the final sale price for our dmg business remains subject to certain post-closing adjustments under its equity purchase agreement which could have a material effect on the total sale proceeds we retain or the total amount of our loss on sale of this business.
significant new accounting standards see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for information regarding certain recent financial accounting standards that have been issued by the fasb.

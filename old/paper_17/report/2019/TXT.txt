item 1a. risk factors our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks, including those discussed below, which may affect the value of our securities. the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant to our business.
we have customer concentration with the u.s. government; reduction in u.s. government defense spending can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
during 2019, we derived approximately 24% of our revenues from sales to a variety of u.s. government entities. our revenues from the u.s. government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various u.s. government defense-related programs. the funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions and the u.s. government budget process which includes enacting relevant legislation, such as appropriations bills and accords on the debt ceiling. although multiple-year contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements, congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years. consequently, programs often are only partially funded initially, and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations. further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the u.s. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as "continuing resolutions" rather than full-year appropriations. if we incur costs in advance or in excess of funds committed on a contract, we are at risk for non-reimbursement of those costs until additional funds are appropriated. the reduction, termination or delay in the timing of funding for u.s. government programs for which we currently provide or propose to provide products or services from time to time has resulted and, in the future, may result in a loss of anticipated revenues. a loss of such revenues could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. significant changes in national and international policies or priorities for defense spending, as well as the potential impact of sequestration, could affect the funding, or the timing of funding, of our programs, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, because our u.s. government contracts generally require us to continue to perform even if the u.s. government is unable to make timely payments, we may need to finance our continued performance for the impacted contracts from our other resources on an interim basis. an extended delay in the timely payment by the u.s. government could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.
u.s. government contracts can be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions.
the u.s. government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract. in the event of termination for the u.s. government's convenience, contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed. a termination arising out of our default for failure to perform could expose us to liability, including but not limited to, all costs incurred under the contract plus potential liability for re-procurement costs in excess of the total original contract amount, less the value of work performed and accepted by the customer under the contract. such an event could also have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. if any of our contracts are terminated by the u.s. government whether for convenience or default, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts. we also enter into "fee for service" contracts with the u.s. government where we retain ownership of, and consequently the risk of loss on, aircraft and equipment supplied to perform under these contracts. termination of these contracts could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. on contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the u.s. government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor. in addition, in the event that the u.s. government is unable to make timely payments, failure to continue contract performance places the contractor at risk of termination for default. any such event could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
9
as a u.s. government contractor, we are subject to procurement rules and regulations ; our failure to comply with these rules and regulations could adversely affect our business.
we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of u.s. government contracts. these laws and regulations, among other things, require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation, define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based u.s. government contracts, and safeguard and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information, covered defense information, and the exportation of certain products and technical data. new laws, regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones (including, for example, regulations related to cybersecurity) can significantly increase our costs, reducing our profitability. our failure to comply with procurement regulations and requirements could allow the u.s. government to suspend or debar us from receiving new contracts for a period of time, reduce the value of existing contracts, issue modifications to a contract, withhold cash on contract payments, and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products, services and associated materials, any of which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. a number of our u.s. government contracts contain provisions that require us to make disclosure to the inspector general of the agency that is our customer if we have credible evidence that we have violated u.s. criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, or bribery; the u.s. civil false claims act; or received a significant overpayment under a u.s. government contract. failure to properly and timely make disclosures under these provisions may result in a termination for default or cause, suspension and/or debarment, and potential fines.
as a u.s. government contractor, our businesses and systems are subject to audit and review by the defense contract audit agency (dcaa) and the defense contract management agency (dcma).
we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the u.s. government and its agencies such as the dcaa and dcma. these agencies review our performance under contracts, our cost structure and our compliance with laws and regulations applicable to u.s. government contractors. the systems that are subject to review include, but are not limited to, our accounting, estimating, material management and accounting, earned value management, purchasing and government property systems. if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions that may include the termination of our contracts, forfeiture or reduction of profits, suspension or reduction of payments, fines, and, under certain circumstances, suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time. whether or not illegal activities are alleged, the u.s. government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate. these laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our government customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business.
the use of multi-award contracts by the u.s. government increases competition, pricing pressure and cost.
the u.s. government increasingly relies upon competitive contract award types, including indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity and multi-award contracts, which have the potential to create greater competition and increased pricing pressure, as well as to increase our cost by requiring that we submit multiple bids. in addition, multi-award contracts increase our cost as they require that we make sustained efforts to obtain task orders and delivery orders under the contract. further, the competitive bidding process is costly and demands managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or may be split among competitors.
our profitability and cash flow varies depending on the mix of our government contracts and our ability to control costs.
under fixed-price contracts, generally we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur, and, consequently, any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us. changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates used in developing the pricing for such contracts can adversely affect our results of operations. additionally, fixed-price contracts generally require progress payments rather than performance-based payments which can delay our ability to recover a significant amount of costs incurred on a contract and thus affect the timing of our cash flows. under fixed-price incentive contracts, we share with the u.s. government cost underrun savings, which are derived from total cost being less than target costs; we also share in cost overruns, which occur when total costs exceed target costs up to a negotiated cost ceiling, but are solely responsible for costs above the ceiling. under time and materials contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. under cost-reimbursement contracts that are subject to a contract-ceiling amount, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee, which may be fixed or performance based, however, if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs. due to the nature of our work under government contracts, we sometimes experience unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns. under each type of contract, if we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards.
10
demand for our aircraft products is cyclical and lower demand adversely affects our financial results.
demand for business jets, turbo props and commercial helicopters has been cyclical and difficult to forecast. therefore, future demand for these products could be significantly and unexpectedly less than anticipated and/or less than previous period deliveries. similarly, there is uncertainty as to when or whether our existing commercial backlog for aircraft products will convert to revenues as the conversion depends on production capacity, customer needs and credit availability. changes in economic conditions has in the past caused, and in the future may cause, customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled, deferred or cancelled. reduced demand for our aircraft products or delays or cancellations of orders previously has had and, in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
we have made and may continue to make acquisitions that increase the risks of our business.
we enter into acquisitions in an effort to expand our business and enhance shareholder value. acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties that, in some cases, have resulted, and, in the future, could result in our not achieving expected benefits. such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner; challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits; the risk that the acquired businesses' markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the acquired businesses' products and technologies do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets; the risk that our due diligence reviews of the acquired business do not identify or adequately assess all of the material issues which impact valuation of the business or result in costs or liabilities in excess of what we anticipated; the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited; the risk that the acquired business may have significant internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions; and the potential loss of key customers, suppliers and employees of the acquired businesses.
failure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance.
we rely on other companies to provide raw materials, major components and subsystems for our products. subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances. we depend on these suppliers and subcontractors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations. our ability to meet our obligations to our customers could be adversely affected if suppliers or subcontractors do not provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and cost-effective manner. likewise, the quality of our products could be adversely impacted if companies to whom we delegate manufacture of major components or subsystems for our products, or from whom we acquire such items, do not provide components or subsystems which meet required specifications and perform to our and our customers' expectations. our suppliers may be less likely than us to be able to quickly recover from natural disasters and other events beyond their control and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations. the risk of these adverse effects would likely be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular raw material, product or service. in particular, in the aircraft industry, most vendor parts are certified by the regulatory agencies as part of the overall type certificate for the aircraft being produced by the manufacturer. if a vendor does not or cannot supply its parts, then the manufacturer's production line may be stopped until the manufacturer can design, manufacture and certify a similar part itself or identify and certify another similar vendor's part, resulting in significant delays in the completion of aircraft. such events may adversely affect our financial results, damage our reputation and relationships with our customers, and result in regulatory actions and/or litigation.
our business could be negatively impacted by information technology disruptions and security threats.
our information technology (it) and related systems are critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day to day processes. from time to time, we update and/or replace it systems used by our businesses. the implementation of new systems can present temporary disruptions of business activities as existing processes are transitioned to the new systems, resulting in productivity issues, including delays in production, shipments or other business operations. we also outsource certain support functions, including certain global it infrastructure services, to third-party service providers, and any disruption of such outsourced processes or functions could have a material adverse effect on our operations. in addition, as a u.s. defense contractor, we face certain security threats, including threats to our it infrastructure and unlawful attempts to gain access to our information via phishing / malware campaigns and other cyberattack methods, as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, as do our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and joint venture partners. attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential, classified or otherwise proprietary information or that of our employees or customers, as well as other security breaches, are persistent, continue to evolve and require highly skilled it resources.
we maintain information systems incident management standards applicable to all our businesses intended to ensure information security events and weaknesses associated with information systems are communicated and acted on in a timely manner. our enterprise risk management program includes cyber risk/network protection mitigation plans, and our disclosure controls and procedures address cybersecurity and include processes intended to ensure that security breaches are analyzed for potential disclosure. additionally, we conduct periodic training for our employees regarding the protection of sensitive information which includes training intended to prevent the success of cyberattacks. further, our insider trading compliance program addresses restrictions against trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information in connection with a cybersecurity incident.
11
while we have experienced cybersecurity attacks, we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks, and we believe our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures are robust. due to the evolving nature of security threats, the possibility of future material incidents cannot be completely mitigated, and we may not always be successful in detecting, reporting or responding to cyber incidents. future attacks or breaches of data security, whether of our systems or the systems of our service providers or other third parties who may have access to our data for business purposes, could disrupt our operations, cause the loss of business information or compromise confidential information, exposing us to liability or regulatory action. such an incident also could require significant management attention and resources, increase costs that may not be covered by insurance, and result in reputational damage, potentially adversely affecting our competitiveness and our results of operations. products and services that we provide to our customers may themselves be subject to cyberthreats which may not be detected or effectively mitigated, resulting in potential losses that could adversely affect us and our customers. in addition, our customers, including the u.s. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands.
developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties.
to continue to grow our revenues and segment profit, we must successfully develop new products and technologies or modify our existing products and technologies for our current and future markets. our future performance depends, in part, on our ability to identify emerging technological trends and customer requirements and to develop and maintain competitive products and services. delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft and other products occur from time to time and could adversely affect our results of operations. these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles, production changes to meet customer demands, unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft or other products, coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed. we also could be adversely affected if our research and development efforts are less successful than expected or if we do not adequately protect the intellectual property developed through these efforts. likewise, new products and technologies could generate unanticipated safety or other concerns resulting in expanded product liability risks, potential product recalls and other regulatory issues that could have an adverse impact on us. furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. a reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, our investments in equipment or technology that we believe will enable us to obtain future service contracts for our u.s. government or other customers may not result in contracts or revenues sufficient to offset such investment. the market for our product offerings does not always develop or continue to expand as we anticipate. furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain superior market acceptance compared to our products. a significant failure in our new product development efforts or the failure of our products or services to achieve market acceptance relative to our competitors' products or services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries that could adversely impact our business.
during 2019, we derived approximately 34% of our revenues from international business, including u.s. exports. conducting business internationally exposes us to additional risks than if we conducted our business solely within the u.s. we maintain manufacturing facilities, service centers, supply centers and other facilities worldwide, including in various emerging market countries. risks related to international operations include import, export, economic sanctions and other trade restrictions; changing u.s. and foreign procurement policies and practices; changes in international trade policies, including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements; potential retaliatory tariffs imposed by foreign countries against u.s. goods; impacts related to the voluntary exit of the united kingdom from the european union ("brexit"); restrictions on technology transfer; difficulties in protecting intellectual property; increasing complexity of employment and environmental, health and safety regulations; foreign investment laws; exchange controls; repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges, competition from foreign and multinational firms with home country advantages; economic and government instability, acts of terrorism and related safety concerns. the impact of any one or more of these or other factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.
12
additionally, some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific in-country purchases, technology transfers, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known as offsets, as a condition for a contract award. these contracts generally extend over several years and may include penalties if we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements which are often subjective. we also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs. in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the foreign corrupt practices act. although we maintain policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, a violation of such laws by any of our international representatives, consultants, joint ventures, business partners, subcontractors or suppliers, even if prohibited by our policies, could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.
we are subject to increasing compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results.
as a global business, we are subject to laws and regulations in the u.s. and other countries in which we operate. international sales and global operations require importing and exporting goods, software and technology, some of which have military applications subjecting them to more stringent import-export controls across international borders on a regular basis. for example, we sometimes initially must obtain licenses and authorizations from various u.s. government agencies before we are permitted to sell certain of our aerospace and defense products outside the u.s., and we are not always successful in obtaining these licenses or authorizations in a timely manner. both u.s. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us have been increasing in scope and complexity. for example, both u.s. and foreign governments and government agencies regulate the aviation industry, and they have previously and may in the future impose new regulations for additional aircraft security or other requirements or restrictions, including, for example, restrictions and/or fees related to carbon emissions levels. changes in environmental and climate change laws and regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to the necessity for new or additional investment in product designs or manufacturing processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures, including costs to defend regulatory reviews. new or changing laws and regulations or related interpretation and policies could increase our costs of doing business, affect how we conduct our operations, adversely impact demand for our products, and/or limit our ability to sell our products and services. compliance with laws and regulations of increasing scope and complexity is even more challenging in our current business environment in which reducing our operating costs is often necessary to remain competitive. in addition, a violation of u.s. and/or foreign laws by one of our employees or business partners could subject us or our employees to civil or criminal penalties, including material monetary fines, or other adverse actions, such as denial of import or export privileges and/or debarment as a government contractor which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business.
if our finance segment is unable to maintain portfolio credit quality, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
a key determinant of the financial performance of our finance segment is the quality of loans, leases and other assets in its portfolio. portfolio quality can be adversely affected by several factors, including finance receivable underwriting procedures, collateral value, geographic or industry concentrations, and the effect of general economic conditions. in addition, a substantial number of the new originations in our finance receivable portfolio are cross-border transactions for aircraft sold outside of the u.s. cross-border transactions present additional challenges and risks in realizing upon collateral in the event of borrower default, which can result in difficulty or delay in collecting on the related finance receivables. if our finance segment has difficulty successfully collecting its finance receivable portfolio, our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
we periodically need to obtain financing and such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.
we periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due, to support our operations and/or to make acquisitions. our access to the debt capital markets and the cost of borrowings are affected by a number of factors including market conditions and the strength of our credit ratings. if we cannot obtain adequate sources of credit on favorable terms, or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
natural disasters or other events outside of our control may disrupt our operations, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and may not be fully covered by insurance.
natural disasters, including hurricanes, fires, tornados, floods and other forms of severe weather, the intensity and frequency of which are being exacerbated by climate change, other impacts of climate change, such as rising sea waters, as well as other events outside of our control including public health crises or pandemics, power outages, industrial explosions or other accidents, have in the past and could in the future disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business. any of these events could result in physical damage to and/or complete or partial closure of one or more of our facilities, temporary or long-term disruption of our operations or the operations of our suppliers by causing business interruptions or by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing or otherwise impacting our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. existing insurance arrangements may not provide full protection for the costs that may arise from such events. the occurrence of any of these events could materially increase our costs and expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
13
global climate change could negatively affect our business.
increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions. if environmental or climate change laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon our business or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.
we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims.
we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business, including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions; government contracts; alleged lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations; production partners; product liability; patent and trademark infringement; employment disputes; and environmental, safety and health matters. due to the nature of our manufacturing business, we are regularly subject to liability claims arising from accidents involving our products, including claims for serious personal injuries or death caused by weather or by pilot, driver or user error. in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable, it is reasonably possible that such claims could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable. in addition, we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate and that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial claims. furthermore, we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and costs in the future. litigation is inherently unpredictable, and we could incur judgments, receive adverse arbitration awards or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our results of operations in any particular period.
intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers.
intellectual property infringement claims are, from time to time, asserted by third parties against us or our customers. any related indemnification payments or legal costs we are obliged to pay on behalf of our businesses, our customers or other third parties can be costly. in addition, we own the rights to many patents, trademarks, brand names, trade names and trade secrets that are important to our business. the inability to enforce these intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. additionally, our intellectual property could be at risk due to cybersecurity threats.
certain of our products are subject to laws regulating consumer products and could be subject to repurchase or recall as a result of safety issues.
as a distributor of consumer products in the u.s., certain of our products are subject to the consumer product safety act, which empowers the u.s. consumer product safety commission (cpsc) to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous. under certain circumstances, the cpsc could require us to repair, replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products, or potentially even discontinue entire product lines. we also may voluntarily take such action and, from time to time, have done so, but within strictures recommended by the cpsc. the cpsc also can impose fines or penalties on a manufacturer for non-compliance with its requirements. furthermore, failure to timely notify the cpsc of a potential safety hazard can result in significant fines being assessed against us. any repurchases or recalls of our products or an imposition of fines or penalties could be costly to us and could damage the reputation or the value of our brands. additionally, laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states, as well as in other countries in which we sell our products, and more restrictive laws and regulations could be adopted in the future.
our success is highly dependent on our ability to maintain a qualified workforce.
our success is highly dependent upon our ability to maintain a workforce with the skills necessary for our businesses to succeed. we need highly skilled personnel in multiple areas including, among others, engineering, manufacturing, information technology, cybersecurity, flight operations, business development and strategy and management. from time to time we face challenges that may impact employee retention such as workforce reductions and facility consolidations and closures. in addition, some of our most experienced employees are retirement-eligible. to the extent that we lose experienced personnel through retirement or otherwise, it is critical for us to develop other employees, hire new qualified employees and successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge. competition for skilled employees is intense, and we may incur higher labor, recruiting and/or training costs in order to attract and retain employees with the requisite skills. we may not be successful in hiring or retaining such employees which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
14
the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results.
our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by increasing costs and funding requirements related to our employee benefit plans. the obligation for our defined benefit pension plans is driven by, among other things, our assumptions of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used for future payment obligations. additionally, as part of our annual evaluation of these plans, significant changes in our assumptions, due to changes in economic, legislative and/or demographic experience or circumstances, or changes in our actual investment returns could negatively impact the funded status of our plans requiring us to substantially increase our pension liability with a resulting decrease in shareholders' equity. also, changes in pension legislation and regulations could increase the cost associated with our defined benefit pension plans.
our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues.
approximately 7,400, or 29%, of our u.s. employees are unionized, and many of our non-u.s. employees are represented by organized councils. as a result, from time to time we experience work stoppages, which can negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis, resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers, loss or delay of revenue and/or increased cost. the presence of unions also may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace. in addition, the workforces of many of our suppliers and customers are represented by labor unions. work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes; similar actions at the plants of our customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products. any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations.
currency, raw material price and interest rate fluctuations can adversely affect our results.
we are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, raw material prices and interest rates. fluctuations in foreign currency rates contribute to variations in revenues and costs in impacted jurisdictions which can adversely affect our profitability. we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program. nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, raw material prices and interest rates can have substantial adverse effects on our results of operations.
we may be unable to effectively mitigate pricing pressures.
in some markets, particularly where we deliver component products and services to oems, we face ongoing customer demands for price reductions, which sometimes are contractually obligated. however, if we are unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures through technological advances or by lowering our cost base through improved operating and supply chain efficiencies, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and various non-u.s. jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the location of income among these different jurisdictions. our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore, changes to unrecognized tax benefits or changes in tax laws, which could affect our profitability. in particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income, as well as changes to applicable statutory tax rates. in addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an overview of our business segments, including a discussion of our major products and services, refer to item 1. business on pages 3 through 9. the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. an analysis of our consolidated operating results is set forth below, and a more detailed analysis of our segments' operating results is provided in the segment analysis section on pages 21 through 27.
at the beginning of 2018, we adopted accounting standards update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (asc 606) using a modified retrospective transition method applied to contracts that were not substantially complete at the end of 2017. we recorded a $90 million adjustment to increase retained earnings to reflect the cumulative impact of adopting this standard at the beginning of 2018, primarily related to certain long-term contracts our bell segment has with the u.s. government that converted to the cost-to-cost method for revenue recognition. for 2019 and 2018, revenues for our u.s. government contracts were primarily recognized as costs are incurred, while revenues for 2017 were primarily recognized as units were delivered. the comparative information for 2017 has not been restated and is reported under the accounting standards in effect at that time.
2019 financial highlights
●   our manufacturing businesses generated $960 million of net cash from operating activities of continuing operations.

●   invested $647 million in research and development activities and $339 million in capital expenditures.

●   returned $521 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments.

●   backlog increased 8% to $9.8 billion, which includes new contracts with the u.s. government for spares and logistic support for the v-22 tiltrotor aircraft and the h-1 helicopter programs at the bell segment.

●   lower industrial revenues of $493 million, primarily reflecting a $248 million impact from the 2018 disposition of the tools and test equipment product line and lower volume and mix of $233 million at the remaining product lines, primarily in the specialized vehicles product line.

●   lower textron systems revenues of $139 million, largely reflecting lower volume of $103 million in the marine and land systems product line and $41 million in the unmanned systems product line.

●   higher textron aviation revenues of $216 million, largely due to higher citation jet volume of $286 million, primarily reflecting the longitude's entry into service in the fourth quarter of 2019, and higher aftermarket volume of $44 million, partially offset by lower defense volume.

●   higher bell revenues of $74 million, resulting from an increase in commercial revenues of $116 million, largely reflecting higher deliveries, partially offset by lower military volume.

revenues decreased $226 million, 2%, in 2018, compared with 2017, largely driven by the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line within the industrial segment. the net revenue decrease included the following factors:
●   lower textron systems revenues of $376 million, primarily reflecting lower volume of $159 million in the marine and land systems product line, along with a decrease due to the discontinuance of our sensor-fuzed weapon product in 2017.

●   lower bell revenues of $137 million, due to lower commercial revenues of $91 million, largely reflecting the mix of aircraft sold in the year, and lower military revenues of $46 million.

●   higher textron aviation revenues of $285 million, due to higher volume and mix of $185 million and favorable pricing of $100 million.

●   higher industrial revenues of $5 million, primarily due to higher volume of $149 million, largely related to the specialized vehicles product line, a favorable impact of $57 million from foreign exchange and the impact from the arctic cat acquisition of $49 million. these increases were largely offset by $246 million in lower revenues due to the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line.

cost of sales and selling and administrative expense cost of sales decreased $188 million, 2%, in 2019, compared with 2018, largely resulting from the impact from the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line, improved performance and a favorable impact of $48 million from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of $94 million from inflation. gross margin as a percentage of manufacturing revenues decreased 70 basis points in 2019, compared with 2018, primarily due to lower margin at the textron aviation segment, reflecting the mix of aircraft sold in the year.
selling and administrative expense decreased $123 million, 10% in 2019, compared with 2018, primarily reflecting the impact from the disposition of tools and test equipment product line and cost reduction activities in the specialized vehicles product line.
in 2018, cost of sales decreased $233 million, 2%, compared with 2017, largely resulting from the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line and lower net volume as described above. selling and administrative expense decreased $59 million, 4%, in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily reflecting the impact from the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line.
interest expense interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations includes interest for both the finance and manufacturing borrowing groups with interest related to intercompany borrowings eliminated. interest expense for the finance segment is included within segment profit and includes intercompany interest. consolidated interest expense increased $5 million in 2019, compared with 2018, primarily due to higher average debt outstanding. in 2018, consolidated interest expense decreased $8 million, compared with 2017, primarily due to lower average debt outstanding.
special charges special charges of $72 million, $73 million and $130 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily include restructuring activities as described in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
gain on business disposition on july 2, 2018, we completed the sale of the businesses that manufacture and sell the products in the tools and test equipment product line within our industrial segment. we recorded an after-tax gain of $419 million in 2018.

effective tax rate   13.5   %    11.7   %    59.8   %
in 2019, the effective tax rate of 13.5% was lower than the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to $61 million in benefits recognized for additional tax credits related to prior years as a result of the completion of a research and development tax credit analysis.
in 2018, our effective tax rate of 11.7% was lower than the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line which resulted in a gain taxable primarily in non-u.s. jurisdictions that partially exempt such gains from tax. the effective tax rate for 2018 also reflects a $25 million benefit recognized upon the reassessment of our reserve for uncertain tax positions based on new information, including interactions with the tax authorities and recent audit settlements. in addition, we finalized the 2017 impacts of the tax cut and jobs act (the tax act) and recognized a $14 million benefit in the fourth quarter of 2018.
our effective tax rate of 59.8% for 2017 was higher than the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, largely due to the impact from the tax act. in the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a provisional estimate of $266 million for one-time adjustments resulting from the tax act. approximately $154 million of this provisional estimate represented a charge resulting from the remeasurement of our u.s. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the remainder represented a provision for the transition tax on post-1986 earnings and profits previously deferred from u.s. income taxes.
for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory tax rate, see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.

segment analysis we operate in, and report financial information for, the following five business segments: textron aviation, bell, textron systems, industrial and finance. segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decision-making purposes. segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense, certain corporate expenses, gains/losses on major business dispositions and special charges. the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense along with intercompany interest income and expense. operating expenses for the manufacturing segments include cost of sales, selling and administrative expense and other non-service components of net periodic benefit cost/(credit), and exclude certain corporate expenses and special charges.
in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group, changes in revenues and segment profit for our commercial businesses typically are expressed in terms of volume and mix, pricing, foreign exchange, acquisitions and dispositions, inflation and performance. for revenues, volume and mix represents changes in revenues from increases or decreases in the number of units delivered or services provided and the composition of products and/or services sold. for segment profit, volume and mix represents a change due to the number of units delivered or services provided and the composition of products and/or services sold at different profit margins. pricing represents changes in unit pricing. foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreign-denominated amounts into u.s. dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period. revenues generated by acquired businesses are reflected in acquisitions for a twelve-month period, while reductions in revenues and segment profit from the sale of businesses are reflected as dispositions. inflation represents higher material, wages, benefits, pension service cost or other costs. performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development, depreciation, selling and administrative costs, warranty, product liability, quality/scrap, labor efficiency, overhead, non-service pension cost/(credit), product line profitability, start-up, ramp up and cost-reduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs.
approximately 24% of our 2019 revenues were derived from contracts with the u.s. government, including those under the u.s. government-sponsored foreign military sales program. for our segments that contract with the u.s. government, changes in revenues related to these contracts are expressed in terms of volume. changes in segment profit for these contracts are typically expressed in terms of volume and mix and performance; these include cumulative catch-up adjustments associated with a) revisions to the transaction price that may reflect contract modifications or changes in assumptions related to award fees and other variable consideration or b) changes in the total estimated costs at completion due to improved or deteriorated operating performance.

total change       $(493)
industrial segment revenues decreased $493 million, 11%, in 2019, compared with 2018, largely due to the impact of $248 million from the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line in 2018 and $233 million of lower volume and mix at the remaining product lines, primarily in the specialized vehicles product line. the reduction in volume in the specialized vehicles product line largely reflected our management of the distribution channel related to products under the arctic cat brand, including a reduction of inventories sold into the channel.
operating expenses for the industrial segment decreased $492 million, 12%, in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to lower operating expenses of $226 million from the disposition of our tools and test equipment product line, lower volume and mix described above and improved performance described below.
factors contributing to the 2018 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:

total change                  $5
industrial segment revenues increased $5 million, in 2018, compared with 2017. higher volume of $149 million, largely related to the specialized vehicles product line, a favorable impact of $57 million from foreign exchange, primarily related to the strengthening of the euro against the u.s. dollar, and the impact of $49 million from the acquisition of arctic cat on march 6, 2017, were largely offset by $246 million in lower revenues due to the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line.
operating expenses for the industrial segment increased $77 million, 2%, in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily due to higher volume described above, the impact from foreign exchange and additional operating expenses from the arctic cat acquisition. these increases were partially offset by lower operating expenses from the disposition of our tools and test equipment product line.

total change            $(72)
segment profit for the industrial segment decreased $72 million, 25%, in 2018, compared with 2017, resulting from the impact of the disposition of our tools and test equipment product line of $22 million, an unfavorable impact of pricing and inflation of $21 million and unfavorable performance and other of $16 million, which were both primarily related to the specialized vehicles product line. the unfavorable volume and mix was primarily due to the mix of products sold in the year. performance and other primarily included additional operating expenses in the first quarter of 2018 due to the timing of the arctic cat acquisition and the seasonality of the outdoor power sports business and unfavorable inventory adjustments in the specialized vehicles product line, partially offset by a favorable impact of $17 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to a patent infringement matter.

liquidity and capital resources our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups. the manufacturing group consists of textron consolidated with its majority-owned subsidiaries that operate in the textron aviation, bell, textron systems and industrial segments. the finance group, which also is the finance segment, consists of textron financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group. our manufacturing group operations include the development, production and delivery of tangible goods and services, while our finance group provides financial services. due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group's activities, investors, rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group's performance. to support those evaluations, we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements.
key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below:

january 4,         december 29,
(dollars in millions)                                          2020                 2018
manufacturing group cash and equivalents                                         $1,181                 $987

shareholders' equity                                          5,518                5,192
capital (debt plus shareholders' equity)                      8,642                8,258
net debt (net of cash and equivalents) to capital          26     %            29      %
debt to capital                                            36     %            37      %
finance group cash and equivalents                                           $176                 $120

we believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing (i.e., leverage) that is in place to support our capital structure, as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage. we believe that we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs, based on our existing cash balances, the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations and other available funding alternatives, as appropriate.
on october 18, 2019, textron entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion, of which up to $100 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit. textron may elect to increase the aggregate amount of commitments under the facility to up to $1.3 billion by designating an additional lender or by an existing lender agreeing to increase its commitment. the facility expires in october 2024, subject to up to two one-year extensions at textron's option with the consent of lenders representing a majority of the commitments under the facility. this new facility replaced the prior 5-year facility, which was scheduled to expire in september 2021. at january 4, 2020 and december 29, 2018, there were no amounts borrowed against either facility. at january 4, 2020, there were $10 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the new facility and at december 29, 2018, there were $10 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the prior facility.
we also maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities. under this registration statement, in may 2019, we issued $300 million of fixed-rate notes due september 2029 with an annual interest rate of 3.90%.
in june 2019, we amended the finance group's $150 million fixed-rate loan due august 2019, extending the maturity date to june 2022 and modifying the annual interest rate from the prior rate of 2.26% to 2.88%.

manufacturing group cash flows cash flows from continuing operations for the manufacturing group as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized below:

(in millions)                2019            2018         2017
operating activities         $960          $1,127         $930
investing activities        (329)             539        (728)
financing activities        (439)         (1,738)        (266)
in 2019, cash flows from operating activities were $960 million, compared with $1,127 million in 2018, a decrease of $167 million. the change in cash flows included a $364 million decrease from changes in inventories between the periods and a $133 million decrease from other liabilities, primarily due to changes in salaries, wages and employer taxes payable, partially offset by a $343 million increase in cash flows from changes in accounts payable.
cash flows provided by operating activities in 2018 were $1,127 million, compared with $930 million in 2017, a 21% increase, primarily reflecting lower pension contributions of $306 million, higher earnings and a dividend of $50 million received from the finance group in 2018, which were partially offset by a higher use of net working capital in 2018, largely reflecting a $145 million cash outflow from changes in net taxes paid/received.
net tax payments/(receipts) were $120 million, $129 million and $(16) million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. pension contributions were $51 million, $52 million and $358 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. in 2017, pension contributions included a $300 million discretionary contribution to fund a u.s. pension plan.
in 2019, investing cash flows included capital expenditures of $339 million. investing cash flows in 2018 included net cash proceeds of $807 million from the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line and net proceeds from corporate-owned life insurance policies of $110 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $369 million. in 2017, cash flows used by investing activities included capital expenditures of $423 million and a $316 million aggregate cash payment for the arctic cat acquisition.
cash flows used in financing activities in 2019 primarily included $503 million of cash paid to repurchase an aggregate of 10.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock under a 2018 share repurchase authorization, and $252 million of payments on long-term debt, partially offset by net proceeds of $301 million from the issuance of long-term debt. in 2018, financing cash flows included $1.8 billion of cash paid to repurchase an aggregate of 29.1 million shares of our outstanding common stock under the 2018 authorization and a prior 2017 authorization. financing cash flows in 2017 included $582 million of cash paid to repurchase an aggregate of 11.9 million of our outstanding common stock under prior share repurchase authorizations and the repayment of outstanding debt of $704 million, partially offset by proceeds from long-term debt of $992 million.
on february 25, 2020, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 25 million shares of our common stock. this new plan allows us to opportunistically repurchase shares and to continue our practice of repurchasing shares to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under compensation and benefit plans. the 2020 plan replaces the prior 2018 share repurchase authorization which was utilized in 2019 and 2018 for repurchases funded, in part, by the net proceeds of $0.8 billion from the disposition of the tools and test product line.
dividend payments to shareholders totaled $18 million, $20 million and $21 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. dividends received from the finance group, which totaled $50 million in both 2019 and 2018, are included within cash flows from operating activities for the manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment.

consolidated cash flows from operating activities were $1,016 million in 2019, compared with $1,109 million in 2018, a decrease of $93 million. the change in cash flows included a $333 million decrease from changes in inventories between the periods and a $125 million decrease from other liabilities, primarily due to changes in salaries, wages and employer taxes payable, partially offset by a $343 million increase in cash flows from changes in accounts payable.
in 2018, consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,109 million, compared with $963 million in 2017, a 15% increase, primarily reflecting lower pension contributions of $306 million and higher earnings, partially offset by a higher use of net working capital in 2018, reflecting a $114 million increase in net tax payments and $45 million in lower cash flows related to captive financing activities.
net tax payments were $121 million, $146 million and $32 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. pension contributions were $51 million, $52 million and $358 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. in 2017, pension contributions included a $300 million discretionary contribution to fund a u.s. pension plan.

captive financing and other intercompany transactions the finance group provides financing primarily to purchasers of new and pre-owned textron aviation aircraft and bell helicopters manufactured by our manufacturing group, otherwise known as captive financing. in the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash received from customers is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties. however, in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups, cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group. for example, when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group, the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group's statement of cash flows. meanwhile, in the manufacturing group's statement of cash flows, the cash received from the finance group on the customer's behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow. although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups, there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing. these captive financing activities, along with all significant intercompany transactions, are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows.

pension and postretirement benefits we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans. actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors, including mortality assumptions, expected retirement age, rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates, which are subject to change in future years. our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually, consistent with applicable laws and regulations; however, future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table. in 2020, we expect to make approximately $25 million of contributions to our funded pension plans and the retirement account plan. based on our current assumptions, which may vary with changes in market conditions, our current contribution for each of the years from 2021 through 2024 is estimated to be approximately $50 million under the plan provisions in place at this time.

other long-term liabilities other long-term liabilities consist of undiscounted amounts in the consolidated balance sheets that primarily include obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs. payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management's assumptions of expected retirement age, mortality, stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals. the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience. certain other long-term liabilities, such as deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, and reserves for product liability, warranty, product maintenance and litigation, have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments.
purchase obligations purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price, quantity and delivery dates. approximately 39% of the purchase obligations we disclose represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the u.s. government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses.

critical accounting estimates to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies. the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below. we believe these policies require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which includes other significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition a substantial portion of our revenues is related to long-term contracts with the u.s. government, including those under u.s. government-sponsored foreign military sales program, for the design, development, manufacture or modification of aerospace and defense products as well as related services.
at the beginning of 2018, we adopted asc 606 as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. with the adoption of this standard , due to the continuous transfer of control to the u.s. government, we recognize revenue over the time that we perform under the contract. selecting the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or service to be provided. we generally use the cost-to-cost method to measure progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. under this measure, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation, and revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred.
prior to the asc 606 adoption, we accounted for our long-term contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting. under this method, we estimated profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract. we then recognized that estimated profit over the contract term based on either the units-of-delivery method or the cost-to-cost method (which typically was used for development effort as costs were incurred), as appropriate under the circumstances. revenues under fixed price contracts generally were recorded using the units-of-delivery method, while revenues under cost-reimbursement contracts were recorded using the cost-to-cost method.
approximately 70% of our 2019 revenues with the u.s. government were under fixed-price and fixed-price incentive contracts. to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit and could potentially incur a loss.
32
the transaction price for our contracts represents our best estimate of the consideration we expect to receive and includes assumptions regarding variable consideration as applicable. certain of our long-term contracts contain incentive fees or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. these variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion. we include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical performance and all other information that is reasonably available to us.
due to the number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, the estimation of total transaction price and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables and, accordingly, is subject to change. in estimating total costs at completion, we are required to make numerous assumptions related to the complexity of design and related development work to be performed; engineering requirements; product performance; subcontractor performance; availability and cost of materials; labor productivity, availability and cost; overhead and capital costs; manufacturing efficiencies; the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials); and costs of satisfying offset obligations, among other variables. our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals. we review and update our cost projections quarterly or more frequently when circumstances significantly change. when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total sales to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.
at the outset of each contract, we estimate an initial profit booking rate considering the risks surrounding our ability to achieve the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), schedule (e.g., the number and type of milestone events), and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion. profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule, and cost aspects of the contract. conversely, the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks; and, as a result, our estimated costs at completion increase. all estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and, therefore, may affect the profit booking rate.
changes in our estimate of the total expected cost or in the transaction price for a contract typically impact our profit booking rate. we utilize the cumulative catch-up method of accounting to recognize the impact of these changes on our profit booking rate for a contract. under this method, the inception-to-date impact of a profit adjustment on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. the impact of our cumulative catch-up adjustments on revenues and segment profit recognized in prior periods is presented below:

(in millions)            2019        2018        2017
gross favorable          $173        $249         $92
gross unfavorable        (82)        (53)        (87)
net adjustments           $91        $196          $5
with the adoption of asc 606 in 2018, a significant portion of our contracts with the u.s. government converted to the cost-to-cost method for revenue recognition from the units of delivery method. the cost-to-cost method generally results in larger cumulative catch-up adjustments since revenue is recognized earlier on these contracts requiring the estimation of costs over longer periods of time. under the units of delivery method that we used for many of our contracts in 2017, we had more time to develop and refine our estimates as we were not required to recognize revenue until our products were delivered much later in the contract term.
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different revenues and/or cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if (a) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment, (b) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation, (c) there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or (d) we are unable to meet contract milestones.

goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings or cash flows, or material adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired. the reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment, in which case such component is the reporting unit. in certain instances, we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics.
we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit, primarily using discounted cash flows. these cash flows incorporate assumptions for short- and long-term revenue growth rates, operating margins and discount rates that represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions, cost structure, anticipated net cost reductions, and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a business having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed. the revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts. the long-term growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate, as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product, inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve. we utilize a weighted-average cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed.
if the reporting unit's estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment, and no further analysis is performed. otherwise, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess carrying value over the estimated fair value amount. based on our annual impairment review, the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values, and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the initial step of the impairment test in the foreseeable future.
retirement benefits we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally. these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations, which are calculated based on actuarial valuations. key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost projections. we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increases. we evaluate and update these assumptions annually.
to determine the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense. for 2019, the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 7.55%, compared with 7.58% in 2018. for the last seven years, the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans, which represent approximately 90% of our total pension assets, was 7.75%. a decrease of 50 basis-points in this long-term rate of return in 2019 would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately $36 million.
the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date, reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. this rate should be in line with rates for high-quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits, which fluctuate as long-term interest rates change. a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense. in 2019, the weighted-average discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 4.24%, compared with 3.67% in 2018. for our domestic plans, the assumed discount rate was 4.35% in 2019, compared with 3.75% in 2018. a decrease of 50 basis-points in this weighted-average discount rate in 2019 would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately $34 million.
the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and has an important effect on postretirement liabilities. the 2019 medical and prescription drug cost trend rates represent the weighted-average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits. in 2019, we assumed a trend rate of 7% for both medical and prescription drug cost and assumed this rate would gradually decline to 5% by 2024 and then remain at that level.

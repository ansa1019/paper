item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, regarding matters which could have an adverse effect, including a material one, on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
risks related to our business the loss of stephen a. wynn could significantly harm our business.
our ability to maintain our competitive position is dependent to a large degree on the efforts, skills and reputation of stephen a. wynn, the chairman of the board, chief executive officer and one of the principal stockholders of wynn resorts. mr. wynn's employment agreement expires in october 2022. however, we cannot assure you that mr. wynn will remain with wynn resorts. if we lose the services of mr. wynn, or if he is unable to devote sufficient attention to our operations for any other reason, our business may be significantly impaired.
visitation to macau may decline due to economic disruptions in mainland china, restrictions on visitations to macau from citizens of mainland china and the anti-corruption campaign.
a significant number of our gaming customers at wynn macau come from mainland china. any economic disruption or contraction in china could disrupt the number of patrons visiting our property or the amount they may be willing to spend. in addition, policies adopted from time to time by the chinese government, including any travel restrictions imposed by china on its citizens such as restrictions imposed on exit visas granted to residents of mainland china for travel to macau, could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland china to our property. it is not known when, or if, policies similar to those implemented in 2009 restricting visitation by mainland chinese citizens to macau and hong kong, will be put in place and travel policies may be adjusted, without notice, in the future. furthermore, the chinese government's ongoing anti-corruption campaign has had an overall chilling effect on the behavior of chinese consumers and their spending patterns both domestically and abroad. the campaign has specifically led to tighter monetary transfer regulations, including real time monitoring of certain financial channels, which could disrupt the number of visitors and the amount of money they can bring from mainland china to macau.  the overall effect of the campaign and monetary transfer restrictions may result in decreased visitation and negatively affect our revenues and results of operations.
our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer and corporate spending as a result of downturns in the global economy.
consumer demand for casino/hotel resorts, trade shows and conventions and for the type of luxury amenities that we offer is particularly sensitive to downturns in the global economy which adversely impact discretionary spending on leisure activities. changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general global economic conditions, high unemployment, the housing foreclosure crisis, perceived or actual changes in disposable consumer income and wealth, an economic recession and changes in consumer confidence in the global economy, or fears of war and future acts of terrorism could reduce customer demand for the luxury amenities and leisure activities we offer, and may have a significant negative impact on our operating results.

potential violations of law by mr. okada (former director and formerly the largest beneficial owner of our shares) and his affiliates could have adverse consequences to the company.
on february 18, 2012, the board of directors of wynn resorts received a report from freeh, sporkin & sullivan, llp detailing numerous instances of conduct constituting prima facie violations of the foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa") by kazuo okada (formerly the largest beneficial owner of our shares) and certain of his affiliates. see item 3-"legal proceedings" and item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 17 "commitments and contingencies." the company has provided the freeh report to applicable regulators and has been cooperating with related investigations of such regulators. the conduct of mr. okada and his affiliates and the outcome of any resulting regulatory findings could have adverse consequences to the company. a finding by regulatory authorities that mr. okada violated the fcpa on company property and/or otherwise involved the company in criminal or civil violations could result in actions by regulatory authorities against the company. relatedly, regulators have and may pursue separate investigations into the company's compliance with applicable laws in connection with the okada matter, as discussed in item 3-"legal proceedings". while the company believes that it is in full compliance with all applicable laws, any such investigations could result in actions by regulators against the company, which could negatively affect the company's financial condition or results of operations.
mr. okada and his affiliates have challenged the redemption of aruze's shares. an adverse judgment or settlement resulting from the related litigation could reduce our profits or limit our ability to operate our business.
on february 18, 2012, after receiving the freeh report, the board of directors of wynn resorts determined that each of the okada parties was "unsuitable" within the meaning of article vii of wynn resorts' articles of incorporation and redeemed all of aruze's shares of wynn resorts' common stock. see item 3-"legal proceedings" and item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 17 "commitments and contingencies". on february 19, 2012, wynn resorts filed a complaint in the eighth judicial district court, clark county, nevada against the okada parties (as amended, the "complaint"), alleging breaches of fiduciary duty and related claims (the "redemption action") arising from the activities addressed in the freeh report. the company is seeking compensatory and special damages as well as a declaration that it acted lawfully and in full compliance with its articles of incorporation, bylaws and other governing documents in redeeming and canceling the shares of aruze. on march 12, 2012, the okada parties filed an answer denying the claims and a counterclaim (as amended, the "counterclaim") against the company, each of the members of the company's board of directors (other than mr. okada) and wynn resorts' general counsel (collectively, the "wynn parties"), seeking, among other things a declaration that the redemption of aruze's shares was void, an injunction restoring aruze's share ownership, damages in an unspecified amount and rescission of the amended and restated stockholders agreement, dated as of january 6, 2010, by and among aruze, stephen a. wynn, and elaine p. wynn (the "stockholders agreement"). in connection with the redemption action and counterclaim (1) various okada parties filed a complaint in the tokyo district court against the company, all members of the board of directors (other than mr. okada) and the company's general counsel alleging that the press release issued by the company in connection with the redemption action has damaged their social evaluation and credibility and seeking damages and legal fees, (2) four federal derivative actions were commenced against the company and all members of its board of directors, (3) two state derivative actions were commenced against the company and all members of its board of directors and (4) regulatory inquiries and investigations were initiated against the company. see item 3-"legal proceedings", for a full description of these matters and status as of the date of this report. the company is vigorously pursuing its claims against the okada parties, and together with the other counter-defendants, vigorously defending against the counterclaim and other actions asserted against them. however, as with all litigation, the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted. any adverse judgments or settlements involving payment of a material sum of money could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could expose us to additional claims by third parties, including current or former investors or regulators. any adverse judgments or settlements would reduce our profits and could limit our ability to operate our business.
change in valuation of our redemption price promissory note could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
in connection with the redemption of the shares previously held by aruze, we recorded the fair value of the redemption note of approximately $1.94 billion in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. we utilized an independent third party valuation to assist in the determination of this fair value. in determining this fair value, we estimated the redemption note's present value using discounted cash flows with a probability weighted expected return for redemption assumptions and a discount rate which included time value and non-performance risk adjustments commensurate with risk of the redemption note.
considerations for the redemption assumptions included the stated maturity of the redemption note, uncertainty of the related cash flows as well as potential effects of the following: uncertainties surrounding the potential outcome and timing of
18
pending litigation with the okada parties (see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 17 "commitments and contingencies"); the outcome of on-going investigations of aruze by the united states attorney's office, the u.s. department of justice and the nevada gaming control board; and other potential legal and regulatory actions. in addition, in the furtherance of various future business objectives, we considered our ability, at our sole option, to prepay the redemption note at any time in accordance with its terms without penalty. accordingly, we reasonably determined that the estimated life of the redemption note could be less than the contractual life of the redemption note.
in determination of the appropriate discount rate to be used in the estimated present value, the redemption note's subordinated position relative to all other debt in our capital structure and credit ratings associated with our traded debt were considered. observable inputs for the risk free rate based on federal reserve rates for u.s. treasury securities and credit risk spread based on a yield curve index of similarly rated debt was used. as a result of this analysis, we concluded the redemption notes' stated rate of 2% approximated a market rate.
a change in any of the assumptions discussed above could result in a change in the fair value of this redemption note and significantly impact our results of operations.
ongoing litigation and other disputes with mr. okada and certain of his affiliates could distract management and result in negative publicity and additional scrutiny of regulators.
there has been widespread publicity of the findings in the freeh report of prima facie violations of law by mr. okada and his affiliates, the board of director's unsuitability finding, the redemption of shares and related litigation. the actions, litigation, and publicity could reduce demand for shares of wynn resorts and wynn macau, limited and thereby have a negative impact on the trading prices of their respective shares. the disputes may also lead to additional scrutiny from regulators, which could lead to investigations relating to, and possibly a negative impact on, the company's gaming licenses, and possibly have a negative impact on the company's ability to bid successfully for new gaming market opportunities.
any violation of applicable anti-money laundering laws or regulations or the foreign corrupt practices act could adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.
we deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. recently, u.s. governmental authorities have evidenced an increased focus on the gaming industry and compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations. the company has been subject to governmental and regulatory inquiries about compliance with such laws and regulations and continues to cooperate with all such inquiries. any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations could adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.
further, we have operations, and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers, outside of the united states. we are therefore subject to regulations imposed by the fcpa and other anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit u.s. companies and their intermediaries from offering, promising, authorizing or making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. violations of the fcpa and other anti-corruption laws, may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and the sec and u.s. department of justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect such laws and regulations.
internal control policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting our directors, employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the law. if we or our directors, employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing our operations, the company may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. any such government investigations, prosecutions or other legal proceedings or actions could adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.
mr. okada failed to comply with internal training in these matters and failed to return to wynn resorts an executed acknowledgment agreeing to comply with the wynn resorts code of business conduct and ethics. on february 19, 2012, wynn resorts' filed a complaint in nevada state court against mr. okada and other entities alleging, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty in connection with alleged violations of the fcpa. for information on such complaint, the freeh report, which detailed numerous instances of conduct constituting prima facie violations of fcpa by mr. okada and certain of his affiliates, and the redemption aruze's shares, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 17 "commitments and contingencies".
19
our casino, hotel, convention and other facilities face intense competition, which may increase in the future.
the casino/hotel industry is highly competitive. our macau operations face intense competition with approximately 35 casinos currently operating in macau. we hold a concession under one of only three gaming concessions and three subconcessions authorized by the macau government to operate casinos in macau. the macau government has had the ability to grant additional gaming concessions since april 2009. if the macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macau through the grant of additional concessions or subconcessions, we would face additional competition, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. several of the current concessionaires and subconcessionaires are expected to open additional facilities in the cotai area of macau over the next few years. the additional cotai facilities currently with planned opening dates in 2015 and 2016 are expected to increase total hotel room inventory by over 40% and significantly increase other gaming and non-gaming offerings in macau.
our macau resort complex also faces competition from casinos located in other areas of asia, including the marina bay sands and resorts world sentosa resorts operating in singapore, genting highlands resort, a major gaming and resort destination located outside of kuala lumpur, malaysia, and casinos in the philippines. we also encounter competition from other major gaming centers located around the world, including australia and las vegas, cruise ships in asia that offer gaming, and other casinos throughout asia. further, if current efforts to legalize gaming in other asian countries are successful, our wynn macau resort will face additional regional competition.
in las vegas, we compete with other las vegas strip hotels and with other hotel casinos in las vegas on the basis of overall atmosphere, range of amenities, level of service, price, location, entertainment, theme and size, among other factors.
wynn las vegas also competes with other casino/hotel facilities in other cities. the proliferation of gaming activities in other areas could significantly harm our business as well. in particular, the legalization or expansion of casino gaming in or near metropolitan areas from which we attract customers could have a negative effect on our business. in addition, new or renovated casinos in macau or elsewhere in asia could draw asian gaming customers away from our las vegas operations.
we are entirely dependent on a limited number of resorts for all of our cash flow, which subjects us to greater risks than a gaming company with more operating properties.
we are currently entirely dependent upon our macau operations and las vegas operations for all of our operating cash flow. as a result, we are subject to a greater degree of risk than a gaming company with more operating properties or greater geographic diversification. the risks to which we have a greater degree of exposure include the following:
•   local economic and competitive conditions;
•   changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations, including gaming laws and regulations;
•   natural and other disasters;
•   a decline in the number of visitors to las vegas or macau;
•   a decrease in gaming and non-casino activities at our resorts; and
•   the outbreak of infectious diseases.
any of the factors outlined above could negatively affect our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments or maintain our covenants with respect to our debt.
we could encounter substantial cost increases higher than expected in the development of our projects.
we are currently constructing wynn palace, in the cotai area of macau, and in development of a wynn resort in massachusetts. the total project budget for wynn palace, including construction costs, capitalized interest, pre-opening expenses, land costs and financing fees, is $4.1 billion.
the projected development costs for wynn palace reflect our best estimates and the actual development costs may be higher than expected. contingencies that have been set aside by us to cover cost overruns may be insufficient to cover the full amount of such overruns. if these contingencies are not sufficient to cover these costs, we may not have the funds required to pay the excess costs and these projects may not be completed. failure to complete these projects may negatively affect our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to pay our debt.
20
all our current and future construction projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows from this planned facility.
major construction projects of the scope and scale of wynn palace and the wynn resort in massachusetts entail significant risks, including:
•   shortages of, and price increases in, materials or skilled labor;
•   changes to plans and specifications;
•   delays in obtaining or inability to obtain requisite licenses, permits and authorizations from regulatory authorities;
•   changes in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations, applicable to gaming, leisure, real estate development or construction projects;
•   unforeseen engineering, environmental and/or geological problems;
•   labor disputes or work stoppages;
•   disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;
•   personal injuries to workers and other persons;
•   environment, health and safety issues, including site accidents;
•   delays or interference from severe weather or natural disasters;
•   geological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems;
•   unanticipated cost increases; and
•   unavailability of construction equipment.
construction, equipment or staffing problems or difficulties in obtaining any of the requisite licenses, permits and authorizations from regulatory authorities could increase the total cost, delay or prevent the construction or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of wynn palace.
we anticipate that only some of the subcontractors engaged for these projects will post bonds guaranteeing timely completion of the subcontractor's work and payment for all of that subcontractor's labor and materials. these bonds may not be adequate to ensure completion of the work.
our wynn palace facility or the wynn resort in massachusetts facility may not commence operations on schedule and construction costs for these projects may exceed budgeted amounts. failure to complete these projects on schedule or within budget may have a significant negative effect on us and on our ability to make payments on our debt.
our new projects may not be successful.
in addition to the construction and regulatory risks associated with our current and future construction projects, we cannot assure you that the level of consumer demand for our casino resorts or for the type of luxury amenities that we will offer will meet our expectations. the operating results of our new projects may be materially different than the operating results of our current integrated resorts due to, among other reasons, differences in consumer and corporate spending and preferences in new geographic areas, increased competition from other markets or other developments that may be beyond our control.  in addition, our new projects may be more sensitive to certain risks, including risks associated with downturns in the economy, than the integrated resorts we currently operate.  the demands caused by new developments on our managerial, operational and other resources may impact our operation of our existing results. if any of these issues were to occur, it could adversely affect our prospects, financial condition, or results of operations.
our business relies on high-end, international customers. we often extend credit, and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit players or credit play may decrease.
general. a significant portion of our table games revenue at our resorts is attributable to the play of a limited number of international customers. the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. a downturn in economic conditions in the countries in which these customers reside could cause a further reduction in the frequency of visits by and revenue generated from these customers.
we conduct our gaming activities on a credit as well as a cash basis. this credit is unsecured. we will extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources, in the opinion of management, warrant such an extension. the collectability of receivables from international customers could be negatively affected by future business or economic trends or by significant events in the countries in which these customers reside.
21
in addition, premium gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter.
wynn las vegas. while gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a "marker," are enforceable under the current laws of nevada, and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states of the united states under the full faith and credit clause of the united states constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that direct or indirect enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the united states of foreign debtors may be used to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from u.s. courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations. we cannot assure that we will be able to collect the full amount of gaming debts owed to us, even in jurisdictions that enforce them. changes in economic conditions may make it more difficult to assess creditworthiness and more difficult to collect the full amount of any gaming debt owed to us. our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.
wynn macau. although the law in macau permits casino operators to extend credit to gaming customers, wynn macau may not be able to collect all of its gaming receivables from its credit players. we expect that wynn macau will be able to enforce these obligations only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including macau. to the extent our gaming customers are visitors from other jurisdictions, we may not have access to a forum in which we will be able to collect all of our gaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and we may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts. our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.
currently, the gaming tax in macau is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue. however, unlike nevada, the gross gaming revenue calculation in macau does not include deductions for uncollectible gaming debts. as a result, if we extend credit to our customers in macau and are unable to collect on the related receivables from them, we remain obligated to pay taxes on our winnings from these customers.
we are subject to extensive state and local regulation and licensing and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations. the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations and authorities could have a negative effect on our business.
the operations of our resorts are contingent upon our obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses, permits, approvals, registrations, findings of suitability, orders and authorizations in the jurisdictions in which our resorts are located. the laws, regulations and ordinances requiring these licenses, permits and other approvals generally relate to the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations, as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations. the nevada gaming commission may require the holder of any debt or securities we or wynn las vegas, llc issue to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own wynn resorts' securities if it has reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of the state of nevada.
the company's articles of incorporation also provide that, to the extent required by the gaming authority making the determination of unsuitability or to the extent the board of directors determines, in its sole discretion, that a person is likely to jeopardize the company's or any affiliate's application for, receipt of, approval for, right to the use of, or entitlement to, any gaming license, shares of wynn resorts' capital stock that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates are subject to redemption by wynn resorts. the redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note, or both, as required, and pursuant to the terms established by, the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as wynn resorts elects.
on february 18, 2012, after receiving the freeh report, the board of directors of wynn resorts determined that the okada parties were "unsuitable" within the meaning of article vii of wynn resorts' articles of incorporation and redeemed all of aruze's shares of wynn resorts' common stock. see item 3-"legal proceedings" and item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 17 "commitments and contingencies".
nevada and massachusetts regulatory authorities also have broad powers to request detailed financial and other information, to limit, condition, suspend or revoke a registration, gaming license or related approvals, approve changes in our operations and levy fines or require forfeiture of assets for violations of gaming laws or regulations. complying with gaming laws, regulations and license requirements is costly. any change in the nevada and massachusetts laws, regulations or licenses applicable to our business or a violation of any current or future laws or regulations applicable to our business or gaming licenses could require us to make substantial expenditures and forfeit assets, and would negatively affect our gaming operations.
22
wynn macau's operations are subject to unique risks. failure to adhere to the regulatory and gaming environment in macau could result in the revocation of wynn macau's concession or otherwise negatively affect its operations in macau. moreover, we are subject to the risk that u.s. regulators could determine that macau's gaming regulatory framework has not developed in a way that would permit us to conduct operations in macau in a manner consistent with the way in which we intend, or the nevada gaming authorities require us, to conduct our operations in the united states.
compliance with changing laws and regulations may result in additional expenses and compliance risks.
changing laws and regulations are creating uncertainty for gaming companies. these changing laws and regulations are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, recent issuance and/or lack of guidance. as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. in addition, further regulation of casinos, financial institutions and public companies is possible. this could result in continuing uncertainty and higher costs regarding compliance matters. due to our commitment to maintain high standards of compliance with laws and public disclosure, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expense. in addition, we are subject to different parties' interpretation of our compliance with these new and changing laws and regulations.
win rates for our gaming operations depend on a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control.
the gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance. in addition to the element of chance, win rates are also affected by other factors, including players' skill and experience, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the spread of table limits, the volume of bets played and the amount of time played. our gaming profits are mainly derived from the difference between our casino winnings and the casino winnings of our gaming customers. since there is an inherent element of chance in the gaming industry, we do not have full control over our winnings or the winnings of our gaming customers.
our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security.
we rely on information technology and other systems (including those maintained by third-parties with whom we contract to provide data services) to maintain and transmit large volumes of customer financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists and reservations information and other personally identifiable information. we also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations. the systems and processes we have implemented to protect customers, employees and company information are subject to the ever-changing risk of compromised security. these risks include cyber and physical security breaches, system failure, computer viruses, and negligent or intentional misuse by customers, company employees, or employees of third party vendors. the steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful and our insurance coverage for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. our third-party information system service providers face risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours, and we do not directly control any of such parties' information security operations. a significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a third-party service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation, cause a material disruption to our operations and management team, and result in remediation expenses, regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other parties whose information was subject to such attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.
our collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations and privacy law is an area that changes often and varies significantly by jurisdiction. compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests. in addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us) or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage of reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data.
our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, including losses resulting from terrorism, and our insurance costs may increase.
we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies for our properties with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary in their breadth and scope. however, in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance
23
coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or could result in certain losses being totally uninsured. as a result, we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, and we could remain obligated for debt or other financial obligations related to the property.
market forces beyond our control may limit the scope of the insurance coverage we can obtain in the future or our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. certain catastrophic losses may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance. as a result, if we suffer such a catastrophic loss, we may not be successful in obtaining future insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels. furthermore, our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to maintain a certain minimum level of insurance. failure to satisfy these requirements could result in an event of default under these debt instruments or material agreements, which would negatively affect our business and financial condition.
our business is particularly sensitive to the willingness of our customers to travel. acts of terrorism, regional political events and developments in the conflicts in certain countries could cause severe disruptions in air travel that reduce the number of visitors to our facilities, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
we are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel. only a small amount of our business is and will be generated by local residents. most of our customers travel to reach our las vegas and macau properties. acts of terrorism may severely disrupt domestic and international travel, which would result in a decrease in customer visits to las vegas and macau, including our properties. regional conflicts could have a similar effect on domestic and international travel. disruptions in air or other forms of travel as a result of any further terrorist act, outbreak of hostilities or escalation of war or worldwide infectious disease outbreak would have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
we are a parent company and our primary source of cash is and will be distributions from our subsidiaries.
we are a parent company with limited business operations of our own. our main asset is the capital stock of our subsidiaries. we conduct most of our business operations through our direct and indirect subsidiaries. accordingly, our primary sources of cash are dividends and distributions with respect to our ownership interests in our subsidiaries that are derived from the earnings and cash flow generated by our operating properties. our subsidiaries might not generate sufficient earnings and cash flow to pay dividends or distributions in the future.
our subsidiaries' payments to us will be contingent upon their earnings and upon other business considerations. in addition, our subsidiaries' debt instruments and other agreements limit or prohibit certain payments of dividends or other distributions to us. we expect that future debt instruments for the financing of our other developments will contain similar restrictions. an inability of our subsidiaries to pay us dividends and distributions would have a significant negative effect on our liquidity.
if a third party successfully challenges our ownership of, or right to use, the wynn-related trademarks and/or service marks, our business or results of operations could be harmed.
our intellectual property assets, especially the logo version of "wynn," are among our most valuable assets. we have filed applications with the pto and with various foreign patent and trademark registries including registries in macau, china, hong kong, singapore, taiwan, japan, certain european countries and various other jurisdictions throughout the world, to register a variety of wynn-related trademarks and service marks in connection with a variety of goods and services. these marks include "wynn resorts," "wynn design and development," "wynn las vegas," "wynn macau," "wynn palace" and "encore." some of the applications are based upon ongoing use and others are based upon a bona fide intent to use the marks in the future.
a common element of most of these marks is the use of the surname "wynn." as a general rule, a surname (or the portion of a mark primarily constituting a surname) is not eligible for registration unless the surname has acquired "secondary meaning." to date, we have been successful in demonstrating to the pto such secondary meaning for the wynn name, in certain of the applications, based upon factors including mr. wynn's prominence as a resort developer, but we cannot assure you that we will be successful with the other pending applications.
federal registrations are not completely dispositive of the right to such marks. third parties who claim prior rights with respect to similar marks may nonetheless challenge our right to obtain registrations or our use of the marks and seek to overcome the presumptions afforded by such registrations.
24
furthermore, due to the increased use of technology in computerized gaming machines and in business operations generally, other forms of intellectual property rights (such as patents and copyrights) are becoming of increased relevance. it is possible that, in the future, third parties might assert superior intellectual property rights or allege that their intellectual property rights cover some aspect of our operations. the defense of such allegations may result in substantial expenses, and, if such claims are successfully prosecuted, may have a material impact on our business. efforts we take to acquire and protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized use throughout the world, which may include retaining counsel and commencing litigation in various jurisdictions, may be costly and may not be successful in protecting and preserving the status and value of our intellectual property assets.
we are subject to taxation by various governments and agencies. the rate of taxation could change.
we are subject to tax by various governments and agencies, both in the u.s. and in macau. changes in the rates of taxation, the amount of taxes we owe and the time when income is subject to taxation, our ability to claim u.s. foreign tax credits, failure to renew our macau dividend agreement and macau income tax exemption after 2015 and the imposition of foreign withholding taxes could increase our overall rate of taxation.
because we own real property, we are subject to extensive environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities.
we have incurred costs to comply with environmental requirements, such as those relating to discharges into the air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. under these and other environmental requirements we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at our property. as an owner or operator, we could also be held responsible to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, personal injury and investigation and cleanup costs incurred by them in connection with any contamination.
these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. the liability under those laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of the responsibility. the costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use our property.
contamination has been identified at and in the vicinity of our site in everett, massachusetts. the ultimate cost of remediating contaminated sites is difficult to accurately predict and we could exceed our current estimates. while we believe that we have adequate resources to cover the costs of the cleanup, we may be required to conduct additional investigations and remediation with respect to this site. as a result, we also could incur material costs in excess of our estimates as a result of additional cleanup obligations imposed or contamination identified in the future.  our proposed expenditures related to environmental matters are not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. however, the environmental laws under which we operate are complicated and often increasingly more stringent, and may be applied retroactively. accordingly, we may be required to make additional expenditures to remain in, or to achieve compliance with, environmental laws in the future.
risks associated with our macau operations we depend upon games promoters for a significant portion of our gaming revenue. if we are unable to maintain, or develop additional, successful relationships with reputable games promoters, our ability to maintain or grow our gaming revenues could be adversely affected.
we may lose the clientele of our games promoters, who generate a significant portion of our gaming revenue. there is intense competition among casino operators in macau for services provided by games promoters, which we expect to intensify as additional casinos open in macau. if we are unable to maintain, or develop additional, successful relationships with reputable games promoters, or lose a significant number of our games promoters to our competitors, our ability to maintain or grow our gaming revenues will be adversely affected and we will have to seek alternative ways of developing relationships with vip customers. in addition, if our games promoters are unable to develop or maintain relationships with our vip customers, our ability to maintain or grow our gaming revenues will be hampered.
25
increased competition for the services of games promoters may require us to pay increased commission rates to games promoters.
certain games promoters have significant leverage and bargaining strength in negotiating operational agreements with casino operators. this leverage could result in games promoters negotiating changes to our operational agreements, including higher commissions, or the loss of business to a competitor or the loss of certain relationships with games promoters. if we need to increase our commission rates or otherwise change our practices with respect to games promoters due to competitive forces, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
failure by the games promoters with whom we work to comply with macau gaming laws and high standards of probity and integrity might affect our reputation and ability to comply with the requirements of our concession, macau gaming laws and other gaming licenses.
the reputations and probity of the games promoters with whom we work are important to our own reputation and to our ability to operate in compliance with our concession, macau gaming laws and other gaming licenses. we conduct periodic reviews of the probity and compliance programs of our gaming promoters. however, we are not able to control our games promoters' compliance with these high standards of probity and integrity, and our games promoters may violate provisions in their contracts with us designed to ensure such compliance. in addition, if we enter into a new business relationship with a games promoter whose probity is in doubt, this may be considered by regulators or investors to reflect negatively on our own probity. if our games promoters are unable to maintain required standards of probity and integrity, we may face consequences from gaming regulators with authority over our operations. furthermore, if any of our games promoters violate the macau gaming laws while on our premises, the macau government may, in its discretion, take enforcement action against us, the games promoter, or each concurrently, and we may be sanctioned and our reputation could be harmed.
the financial resources of our games promoters may be insufficient to allow them to continue doing business in macau which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. our games promoters may experience difficulty in attracting patrons.
given present market conditions in macau and certain economic and other factors occurring in the region, games promoters may encounter difficulties in attracting patrons to come to macau. further, gaming promoters may experience decreased liquidity, limiting their ability to grant credit to their patrons, resulting in decreased gaming volume in macau and at wynn macau. credit already extended by our games promoters to their patrons may become increasingly difficult for them to collect. this inability to attract sufficient patrons, grant credit and collect amounts due in a timely manner can negatively affect our games promoters' operations, cause games promoters to wind up or liquidate their operations or result in our gaming promoters leaving macau, and as a result, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
revenues from our macau gaming operations will end if we cannot secure an extension of our concession in 2022 or if the macau government exercises its redemption right in 2017.
our concession agreement with the macau government expires in june 2022. unless our concession is extended, in june 2022, all of our gaming operations and related equipment in macau will be automatically transferred to the macau government without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any revenues from these operations. beginning in june 2017, the macau government may redeem the concession agreement by providing us at least one year's prior notice. in the event the macau government exercises this redemption right, we are entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. the amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of revenue generated during the tax year prior to the redemption multiplied for the remaining years under the concession. we may not be able to renew or extend our concession agreement on terms favorable to us or at all and, if our concession is redeemed, the compensation paid to us may not be adequate to compensate us for the loss of future revenues. the redemption of or failure to extend our concession would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
if wynn macau fails to comply with the concession agreement, the macau government can terminate our concession without compensation to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
the macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate our concession in the event of our material non-compliance with the basic obligations under the concession and applicable macau laws. the concession agreement expressly provides that the government of macau may unilaterally rescind the concession agreement if wynn macau:
•   conducts unauthorized games or activities that are excluded from its corporate purpose;
26
•   suspends gaming operations in macau for more than seven consecutive days (or more than 14 days in a civil year) without justification;
•   defaults in payment of taxes, premiums, contributions or other required amounts;
•   does not comply with government inspections or supervision;
•   systematically fails to observe its obligations under the concession system;
•   fails to maintain bank guarantees or bonds satisfactory to the government;
•   is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings or becomes insolvent;
•   engages in serious fraudulent activity, damaging to the public interest; or
•   repeatedly violates applicable gaming laws.
if the government of macau unilaterally rescinds the concession agreement, wynn macau will be required to compensate the government in accordance with applicable law, and the areas defined as casino space under macau law and all of the gaming equipment pertaining to our gaming operations will be transferred to the government without compensation. the loss of our concession would prohibit us from conducting gaming operations in macau, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
our macau subsidiaries' indebtedness is secured by a substantial portion of their assets.
subject to applicable laws, including gaming laws, and certain agreed upon exceptions, our macau subsidiaries' debt is secured by liens on substantially all of their assets. in the event of a default by such subsidiaries under their financing documents, or if such subsidiaries experience insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the holders of such secured debt would first be entitled to payment from their collateral security, and only then would holders of our macau subsidiaries' unsecured debt be entitled to payment from their remaining assets.
we compete for limited labor resources in macau and macau government policies may also affect our ability to employ imported labor.
the success of our operations in macau will be affected by our success in hiring and retaining employees. we compete with a large number of casino resorts in macau for a limited number of qualified employees. in addition, the macau government requires that we only hire macau residents as dealers in our casinos. competition for these individuals in macau is likely to increase as we open wynn palace, and as other competitors expand their operations. we have to seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resort and certain macau government policies affect our ability to import labor in certain job classifications. despite our coordination with the macau labor and immigration authorities to assure that our labor needs are satisfied, we may not be able to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees for our operations or obtain required work permits for those employees. if we are unable to obtain, attract, retain and train skilled employees, our ability to adequately manage and staff our existing and planned casino and resort properties in macau could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
wynn macau may be affected by adverse political and economic conditions.
our macau operations are subject to significant political, economic and social risks inherent in doing business in an emerging market. macau's legislative, regulatory, legal, economic and cultural institutions are in a period of transition. the continued success of wynn macau will depend on political and economic conditions in macau and mainland china. for example, fiscal decline and civil, domestic or international unrest in macau, china or the surrounding region could significantly harm our business, not only by reducing customer demand for casino resorts, but also by increasing the risk of imposition of taxes and exchange controls or other governmental restrictions, laws or regulations that might impede wynn macau's operations or ability to repatriate funds.
we are currently required to complete wynn palace by may 2017. if we are unable to meet this deadline, we may lose the respective land concession, which could prohibit us from operating any facilities developed under such land concession.
the company has capitalized approximately $1.8 billion, including the land premium (net of amortization) and $148.4 million in outstanding construction payables, as of december 31, 2014.  under the company's land concession for wynn palace, the company is required to complete the development by may 2017.  should the company determine that it is unable to complete wynn palace by this deadline, the company would expect to apply for an extension from the macau government.  if the company is unable to meet the current deadline and the deadline for the development is not extended, the company could lose its land concession for wynn palace, which would prohibit the company from operating any facilities developed under the land concession.  as a result, the company could record a charge for all or some portion of its capitalized construction costs and land premiums (net of amortization).
27
macau may not have an adequate transportation infrastructure to accommodate the demand from future development.
because of additional casino projects which are under construction and to be developed in the future, the ferry and helicopter services which provide transportation between macau and hong kong may need to be expanded to accommodate the increased visitation of macau. if transportation facilities to and from macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting macau, the desirability of macau as a gaming destination, as well as the results of operations of wynn macau, could be negatively impacted.
the smoking control legislation in macau could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
in 2014, the macau government approved smoking control legislation, which prohibits smoking in casinos starting on october 6, 2014. the legislation, however, permits casinos to maintain certain limited smoking areas open to vip patrons if such areas are within restricted access areas, comply with certain square footage ratios based on overall gaming area square footage and comply with the conditions set out in the dispatch of the chief executive, dated november 1, 2012, as amended by the dispatch of the chief executive, dated june 3, 2014. recent public announcements by the macau government indicate that the macau government intends to pursue a full smoking ban within all macau casinos. the existing smoking legislation, and any smoking legislation intended to fully ban all smoking in casinos, may deter potential gaming customers who are smokers from frequenting casinos in macau and disrupt the number of patrons visiting or the amount of time visiting patrons spend at our property, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
extreme weather conditions may have an adverse impact on wynn macau.
macau's subtropical climate and location on the south china sea are subject to extreme weather conditions including typhoons and heavy rainstorms. unfavorable weather conditions could negatively affect the profitability of our resort complex and prevent or discourage guests from traveling to macau.
conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of wynn macau, limited.
in october 2009, wynn macau, limited, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of wynn resorts and the developer, owner and operator of wynn macau, listed its ordinary shares of common stock on the stock exchange of hong kong limited. wynn macau, limited sold through an initial public offering, 1,437,500,000 shares, 27.7% of this subsidiary's common stock. as a result of wynn macau, limited having stockholders who are not affiliated with us, we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers and/or directors of wynn macau, limited may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of wynn macau, limited. decisions that could have different implications for wynn resorts and wynn macau, limited, including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with wynn macau, limited, may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest.
certain nevada gaming laws apply to wynn macau's gaming activities and associations.
certain nevada gaming laws also apply to gaming activities and associations in jurisdictions outside the state of nevada. with respect to our wynn macau operations, we and our subsidiaries that must be licensed to conduct gaming operations in nevada are required to comply with certain reporting requirements concerning gaming activities and associations in macau conducted by our macau-related subsidiaries. we and our licensed nevada subsidiaries also will be subject to disciplinary action by the nevada gaming commission if our macau-related subsidiaries:
•   knowingly violate any macau laws relating to their macau gaming operations;
•   fail to conduct wynn macau's operations in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of nevada gaming operations;
•   engage in any activity or enter into any association that is unsuitable for us because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in nevada, reflects or tends to reflect discredit or disrepute upon the state of nevada or gaming in nevada, or is contrary to nevada gaming policies;
•   engage in any activity or enter into any association that interferes with the ability of the state of nevada to collect gaming taxes and fees; or
•   employ, contract with or associate with any person in the foreign gaming operation who has been denied a license or a finding of suitability in nevada on the ground of unsuitability, or who has been found guilty of cheating at gambling.
28
such disciplinary action could include suspension, conditioning, limitation or revocation of the registration, licenses or approvals held by us and our licensed nevada subsidiaries, including wynn las vegas, llc, and the imposition of substantial fines.
in addition, if the nevada state gaming control board determines that any actual or intended activities or associations of our macau-related subsidiaries may be prohibited pursuant to one or more of the standards described above, the nevada state gaming control board can require us and our licensed nevada subsidiaries to file an application with the nevada gaming commission for a finding of suitability of the activity or association. if the nevada gaming commission finds that the activity or association in macau is unsuitable or prohibited, our macau-related subsidiaries will either be required to terminate the activity or association, or will be prohibited from undertaking the activity or association. consequently, should the nevada gaming commission find that our macau-related subsidiary's gaming activities or associations in macau are unsuitable, those subsidiaries may be prohibited from undertaking their planned gaming activities or associations in macau, or be required to divest their investment in macau, possibly on unfavorable terms.
unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates may increase wynn macau's obligations under the concession agreement and cause fluctuations in the value of our investment in macau.
the currency delineated in wynn macau's concession agreement with the government of macau is the macau pataca. the macau pataca, which is not a freely convertible currency, is linked to the hong kong dollar, and the two are often used interchangeably in macau. the hong kong dollar is linked to the u.s. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. however, the exchange linkages of the hong kong dollar and the macau pataca, and the hong kong dollar and the u.s. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to changes in chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments.
if the hong kong dollar and the macau pataca are no longer linked to the u.s. dollar, the exchange rate for these currencies may severely fluctuate. the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for these currencies may also change.
because many of wynn macau's payment and expenditure obligations are in macau patacas, in the event of unfavorable macau pataca or hong kong dollar rate changes, wynn macau's obligations, as denominated in u.s. dollars, would increase. in addition, because we expect that most of the revenues for any casino that we operate in macau will be in hong kong dollars, we are subject to foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate between the hong kong dollar and the u.s. dollar. also, if any of our macau-related entities incur u.s. dollar-denominated debt, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the macau pataca or the hong kong dollar, in relation to the u.s. dollar, could have adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to service its debt.
currency exchange controls and currency export restrictions could negatively impact wynn macau.
currency exchange controls and restrictions on the export of currency by certain countries may negatively impact the success of wynn macau. for example, there are currently existing currency exchange controls and restrictions on the export of the renminbi, the currency of china. restrictions on the export of the renminbi may impede the flow of gaming customers from china to macau, inhibit the growth of gaming in macau and negatively impact wynn macau's gaming operations.
risks related to share ownership and stockholder matters our largest stockholders are able to exert significant influence over our operations and future direction.
as of december 31, 2014, mr. wynn and elaine p. wynn own 10,026,708 shares and 9,608,334 shares, respectively, or in the aggregate approximately 19.4%, of our outstanding common stock. as a result, mr. wynn and elaine p. wynn, to the extent they vote their shares in a similar manner, may be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring our stockholders' approval, including the approval of significant corporate transactions. in addition, until february 2012, aruze owned 24,549,222 shares of our outstanding common stock. on february 18, 2012, the company redeemed all of the shares of the company's common stock held by aruze for additional information on the redemption, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 17 "commitments and contingencies".
under the stockholders agreement, mr. wynn and elaine p. wynn have agreed to vote the shares of the company's common stock held by them subject to the terms of the stockholders agreement in a manner so as to elect to our board of
29
directors each of the nominees contained on each and every slate of directors endorsed by mr. wynn, which slate will include, subject to certain exceptions, elaine p. wynn. as a result of this voting arrangement, mr. wynn, as a practical matter, exercises significant influence over the slate of directors to be elected to our board of directors. in addition, with stated exceptions, the stockholders agreement requires the written consent of the other party prior to any party selling any shares of the company's common stock that it owns.
in june 2012, in connection with the pending litigation between the company and aruze, elaine p. wynn submitted a cross claim against mr. wynn and mr. okada seeking to void the stockholders agreement. certain wynn las vegas, llc indentures provide that if mr. wynn, together with certain related parties, in the aggregate beneficially owns a lesser percentage of the outstanding common stock of the company than is beneficially owned by any other person, a change of control will have occurred. if elaine p. wynn prevails in her cross claim, mr. wynn would not beneficially own or control elaine p. wynn's shares and a change in control may result under the wynn las vegas, llc debt documents. for additional information on the cross claim, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 8 "long-term debt" and note 17 "commitments and contingencies".
in november 2006, the board of directors of wynn resorts approved an amendment of its bylaws that exempts future acquisitions of shares of wynn resorts' common stock by either mr. wynn or aruze from nevada's acquisition of controlling interest statutes. in light of the determination by the board of directors on february 18, 2012 that each of the okada parties is an "unsuitable person" under the company's articles of incorporation and the redemption and cancellation of aruze's shares of company common stock, our fifth amended and restated bylaws amended these provisions to delete the reference to aruze and its affiliates. the nevada acquisition of controlling interest statutes require stockholder approval in order to exercise voting rights in connection with any acquisition of a controlling interest in certain nevada corporations unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation in effect on the 10th day following the acquisition of a controlling interest by certain acquiring persons provide that these statutes do not apply to the corporation or to the acquisition specifically by types of existing or future stockholders. these statutes define a "controlling interest" as (i) one-fifth or more but less than one third, (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (iii) a majority or more, of the voting power in the election of directors. as a result of these bylaws provisions, mr. wynn or his affiliates may acquire ownership of outstanding voting shares of wynn resorts permitting him or them to exercise more than one-third but less than a majority, or a majority or more, of all of the voting power of the company in the election of directors, without requiring a resolution of the company's stockholders granting voting rights in the control shares acquired.
our stock price may be volatile.
the trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations. our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as general united states, china, and world economic and financial conditions, our own quarterly variations in operating results, increased competition, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, changes in applicable laws or regulations, and changes affecting the travel industry. the stock market in general, and prices for companies in our industry in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that may be unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.
risks related to our substantial indebtedness we are highly leveraged and future cash flow may not be sufficient for us to meet our obligations, and we might have difficulty obtaining more financing.
we have a substantial amount of consolidated debt in relation to our equity. as of december 31, 2014, we had total outstanding debt of approximately $7.3 billion, which includes a portion of the funds we expect to need for the development and construction of our projects, wynn palace and the wynn resort in massachusetts. we may, however, incur additional indebtedness in connection with the construction of these projects. see item 1-"business", "construction and development opportunities". in addition, we are permitted to incur additional indebtedness if certain conditions are met, including conditions under our wynn macau credit facilities, our wynn america credit facilities and our wynn las vegas, llc indentures in connection with other future potential development plans. on february 18, 2012, we issued a redemption note with a principal amount of approximately $1.94 billion in redemption of all of the shares of wynn resorts common stock held by aruze. for additional information on the redemption and the redemption note, see item 3-"legal proceedings" and item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 17 "commitments and contingencies".
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. for example:
30
•   failure to meet our payment obligations or other obligations could result in acceleration of our indebtedness, foreclosure upon our assets that serve as collateral or bankruptcy and trigger cross defaults under other agreements;
•   servicing our indebtedness requires a substantial portion of our cash flow from the operations of wynn las vegas and wynn macau and reduces the amount of available cash, if any, to fund working capital and other cash requirements;
•   the okada parties have challenged the redemption of aruze's shares and we are currently involved in litigation with those parties as well as related shareholder derivative litigation. the outcome of these various proceedings cannot be predicted. any adverse judgments or settlements involving payment of a material sum of money could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could expose us to additional claims by third parties including current or former investors or regulators. any adverse judgments or settlements would reduce our profits and could limit our ability to operate our business. see item 3-"legal proceedings" and item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 17 "commitments and contingencies";
•   we may experience decreased revenues from our operations due to decreased consumer spending levels and high unemployment, and could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs and/or fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under our existing indebtedness. our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs;
•   we may not be able to obtain additional financing, if needed, to satisfy working capital requirements or pay for other capital expenditures, debt service or other obligations; and
•   rates with respect to a portion of the interest we pay will fluctuate with market rates and, accordingly, our interest expense will increase if market interest rates increase.
under the terms of the documents governing our debt facilities, subject to certain limitations, we are permitted to incur indebtedness. if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above will be exacerbated.
the agreements governing our debt facilities contain certain covenants that restrict our ability to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions.
some of our debt facilities require us to satisfy various financial covenants, which include requirements for minimum interest coverage ratios and leverage ratios pertaining to total debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization and a minimum earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. for more information on financial covenants we are subject to under our debt facilities, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 8 "long-term debt." future indebtedness or other contracts could contain covenants more restrictive than those contained in our existing debt facilities.
the agreements governing our debt facilities also contain restrictions on our ability to engage in certain transactions and may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions. these restrictions include, among other things, limitations on our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:
•   pay dividends or distributions or repurchase equity;
•   incur additional debt;
•   make investments;
•   create liens on assets to secure debt;
•   enter into transactions with affiliates;
•   issue stock of, or member's interests in, subsidiaries;
•   enter into sale-leaseback transactions;
•   engage in other businesses;
•   merge or consolidate with another company;
•   transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of assets;
•   issue disqualified stock;
•   create dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; and
•   designate restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries.
our ability to comply with the terms of our outstanding facilities may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions and other events outside of our control. as a result, we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants. if our or our properties' operations fail to generate adequate cash flow, we may violate those covenants, causing a default under our agreements, which would materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition or result in our lenders or holders of our debt taking action to enforce their security interests in our various assets or cause all outstanding amounts to be due and payable immediately.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
overview we are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts (integrated resorts). in the macau special administrative region of the people's republic of china ("macau"), we own 72% of and operate wynn macau and encore at wynn macau. we refer to the integrated wynn macau and encore at wynn macau resort as wynn macau | encore or as our macau operations. in las vegas, nevada, we own 100% of and operate wynn las vegas and encore at wynn las vegas, which we refer to as wynn las vegas | encore or our las vegas operations. we are currently constructing wynn palace, an integrated casino resort in the cotai area of macau. in addition, we are developing an integrated casino resort in everett, massachusetts.
40
macau operations our macau integrated resort of wynn macau and encore at wynn macau features approximately 284,000 square feet of casino space with 498 table games and 625 slot machines and two luxury hotel towers with a total of 1,008 spacious guest rooms and suites. wynn macau | encore includes casual and fine dining in eight restaurants, approximately 57,000 square feet of retail space, approximately 31,000 square feet of lounge and meeting facilities and recreation and leisure facilities.
in response to our evaluation of our macau operations and the reactions of our guests, we have made and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to our resort. in february 2015, we completed a renovation of approximately 27,000 square feet of our casino space at wynn macau into new vip gaming rooms.
las vegas operations our integrated las vegas resort of wynn las vegas and encore at wynn las vegas features approximately 186,000 square feet of casino space with 232 table games, 1,849 slot machines and two luxury hotel towers with a total of 4,748 spacious guest rooms, suites and villas. wynn las vegas | encore includes 34 food and beverage outlets, approximately 99,000 square feet of retail space, approximately 290,000 square feet of meeting and convention space, an on-site 18 hole golf course, a ferrari and maserati dealership, as well as two showrooms, three nightclubs and a beach club.
in response to our evaluation of our las vegas operations and the reactions of our guests, we have and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to our resort.
future development we are currently constructing wynn palace, an integrated resort containing a 1,700-room hotel, performance lake, meeting space, casino, spa, retail offerings and food and beverage outlets in the cotai area of macau. in july 2013, we signed a $2.6 billion gmp contract for the project's construction. the total project budget, including construction costs, capitalized interest, pre-opening expenses, land costs and financing fees, is approximately $4.1 billion. as of december 31, 2014, we have invested approximately $1.8 billion in the project. we expect to open wynn palace in the first half of 2016.
on september 17, 2014, the massachusetts gaming commission designated wynn ma, llc, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company, the award winner of the greater boston (region a) gaming license. on november 4, 2014, a vote upheld the expanded gaming law in massachusetts. on november 7, 2014, the gaming license awarded to us became effective.
on january 2, 2015, we purchased 33 acres of land in everett, massachusetts, along the mystic river. on this land, we intend to develop and operate an integrated resort containing a hotel, restaurants, casino, spa, premium retail offerings, meeting and convention space and a waterfront boardwalk.
we continually seek out new opportunities for additional gaming or related businesses, in the united states, and worldwide.
key operating measures certain key operating measures specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which a consolidated statement of income is presented. below are definitions of these key operating measures discussed:
•   table games win is the amount of drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenue.
•   drop is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table's drop box.
•   turnover is the sum of all losing rolling chip wagers within our macau operations' vip program.
•   rolling chips are identifiable chips that are used to track turnover for purposes of calculating incentives.
•   slot win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenue.
•   average daily rate ("adr") is calculated by dividing total rooms revenue including the retail value of promotional allowances (less service charges, if any) by total rooms occupied including complimentary rooms.
•   revenue per available room ("revpar") is calculated by dividing total rooms revenue including the retail value of promotional allowances (less service charges, if any) by total rooms available.
•   occupancy is calculated by dividing total occupied rooms, including complimentary rooms, by the total rooms available.
41
below is a discussion of the methodologies used to calculate win percentage at our resorts.
in our vip casino in macau, customers primarily purchase non-negotiable chips, commonly referred to as rolling chips, from the casino cage and there is no deposit into a gaming table drop box from chips purchased from the cage. non-negotiable chips can only be used to make wagers. winning wagers are paid in cash chips. the loss of the non-negotiable chips in the vip casino is recorded as turnover and provides a base for calculating vip casino win percentage. it is customary in macau to measure vip casino play using this rolling chip method. we expect our win as a percentage of turnover in this segment to be within the range of 2.7% to 3.0%.
the measurement base used in the mass market casino in macau is not the same as that used in the vip casino. in our mass market casino in macau, customers may purchase cash chips at either the gaming tables or at the casino cage. the cash used to purchase the cash chips at the gaming tables is deposited into the gaming table's drop box. this is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage in our mass market casino. we do not report an expected range for the win percentage in our mass market casino as chips purchased at the casino cage are excluded from table games drop and distort our expected win percentage. because of the large number of chip purchases occurring at the casino cage, we believe the relevant indicator of volumes in the mass market segment should be table games win.
the measurements in our vip casino and the mass market casino are not comparable as the mass market casino tracks the initial purchase of chips at the table while the measurement method in our vip casino tracks the sum of all losing wagers. accordingly, the base measurement in the vip casino is much larger than the base measurement in the mass market casino. as a result, the expected win percentage with the same amount of gaming win is smaller in the vip casino when compared to the mass market casino.
in las vegas, customers purchase chips at the gaming tables. the cash and net markers used to purchase chips are deposited in the gaming table's drop box. this is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage in las vegas. each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage. our expected table games win percentage in las vegas is 21% to 24%.

during the year ended december 31, 2014, our net income attributable to wynn resorts, limited was $731.6 million, an increase of 0.4% over the same period of 2013, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $7.18. adjusted property ebitda decreased year-over-year by 2.1%, from $1,810.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 to $1,773.3 million for the same period of 2014. our results for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period of 2013 were primarily attributable to a 5.8% decline in casino revenues from our macau operations offset by non-casino revenue growth from our las vegas operations. although we experienced stable overall visitation to our macau operations, a significant slowdown in activity from our premium customers drove the decline in casino revenues.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, our net income attributable to wynn resorts, limited was $728.7 million, an increase of 45.1% over the same period of 2012, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $7.17. adjusted property ebitda increased year-over-year by 14.9%, from $1,575.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2012 to $1,810.8 million for the same period of 2013. our results for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the same period of 2012 were primarily driven by an increase of 10.6%, or $365.4 million in casino revenue from our macau operations and an increase of 15.3%, or $90.5 million in casino revenues from our las vegas operations.

net revenues decreased 3.3% to $5,433.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $5,620.9 million for the same period in 2013. the decline in net revenues was primarily driven by a decrease of 5.8%, or $221.1 million in casino revenue from our macau operations, partially offset by an increase of 5.8%, or $51.8 million, in non-casino revenues from our las vegas operations.
non-casino revenues consist of operating revenues from rooms, food and beverage, entertainment, retail and other, less promotional allowances. the following table presents net revenues from our casino revenues and non-casino revenues (in thousands).

casino revenues casino revenues decreased 4.8% to $4,274.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $4,490.6 million in the same period of 2013. our macau operations experienced a year-over-year decrease in casino revenues of 5.8% from $3,807.9 million to $3,586.8 million. the decrease is primarily due to a decrease from our vip gaming operations, partially offset by an increase of 7.1% in table games win percentage from our mass market gaming operations. our vip gaming operations experienced a 12.1% reduction in turnover and a decline in win as a percentage of turnover from 3.01% to 2.82%. las vegas operations were relatively flat year-over-year with casino revenues of $687.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $682.8 million in the same period of 2013.

(1)   customers purchase mass market casino gaming chips at either the gaming tables or the casino cage. chips purchased at the casino cage are excluded from table games drop and will increase the expected win percentage. because of the large number of chip purchases occurring at the casino cage in our macau mass market casino, we believe the relevant indicator of volumes in the mass market casino should be actual table games win.

food and beverage revenues increased 3.1%, or $18.0 million, to $604.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $586.7 million for the same period of 2013. the increase is primarily a result of an increase in revenues at our las vegas operations.
entertainment, retail and other decreased 4.2%, or $17.5 million, to $401.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $418.7 million for the same period of 2013. the decrease is primarily due to a decline in revenue from retail shops at our macau operations.
promotional allowances increased 6.0%, or $21.9 million, to $389.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $367.3 million for the same period of 2013. as a percentage of total casino revenues, promotional allowances were 9.1% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 8.2% for the same period of 2013.
operating costs and expenses operating costs and expenses decreased 3.8%, or $163.5 million, to $4,167.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $4,330.8 million for the same period of 2013. the reduction was primarily driven by decreases of casino expenses and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses and pre-opening costs.
casino expenses decreased 6.3%, or $179.5 million, to $2,667.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $2,846.5 million for the same period of 2013, primarily due to lower gaming taxes from the 39.0% gross win tax incurred at our macau operations. the decline in gaming taxes was commensurate with the 5.8% decrease in casino revenues at our macau operations.
rooms expense increased 11.1%, or $14.8 million, to $148.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $133.5 million for the same period of 2013. the increase is due to certain rooms expense from our las vegas operations to maintain a premium guest experience and expenses associated with the increase in occupancy over the prior year at both our macau and las vegas operations.
food and beverage expenses increased 4.2%, or $13.6 million, to $337.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $323.6 million for the same period of 2013. the increase in food and beverage expenses is primarily a result of higher costs in the current period for entertainment at wynn las vegas nightclubs.
general and administrative expenses increased 9.7%, or $43.7 million, to $492.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $448.8 million in the same period of 2013 primarily from our macau operations. our macau operations experienced an increase compared to the prior year in labor costs, along with certain property maintenance and repair expenses
45
and other miscellaneous items. our macau operations incurred additional general and administrative labor costs associated with a new 2014 bonus program for non-management employees.
pre-opening costs were $30.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $3.2 million for the same period of 2013 and were primarily associated with the design and planning for wynn palace. we expect our pre-opening costs to increase in the future as the construction and development of wynn palace progresses toward the expected completion in the first half of 2016 and with the beginning of development for the wynn resort in massachusetts.
depreciation and amortization decreased 15.3%, or $56.9 million, to $314.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $371.1 million for the same period of 2013 due to certain las vegas operations assets with a five year useful life becoming fully depreciated.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased 5.4%, or $16.0 million, to $315.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, up from $299.0 million for the same period of 2013, attributable to a $39.0 million increase in interest expense partially offset by a $23.0 million increase in capitalized interest. during 2013, we completed issuances of $500 million 4 1/4% senior notes, $600 million 5 1/4% senior notes and exercised our option to increase our macau senior term loan facility by $200 million. during the first quarter of 2014, we issued an additional $750 million of 5 1/4% senior notes. these issuances of long-term debt were partially offset by the principal repayment of $500 million 7 7/8% first mortgage notes through a cash tender offer in may 2013 and redemption of untendered notes in november 2013. in addition, our interest expense associated with our first mortgage notes reduced year-over-year as a result of open market repurchases we made during 2014. capitalized interest increased due to the construction costs of wynn palace. capitalized interest will continue to increase with the ongoing borrowings and construction costs related to wynn palace.
other non-operating income and expenses we incurred a loss of $9.6 million on the extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to a loss of $40.4 million for the same period of 2013. during the year ended december 31, 2014, the loss was due to the premium paid on the purchase of first mortgage notes due in 2020 through open market transactions and the write-off of related unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount. during the year ended december 31, 2013, the loss was primarily from the premium paid in the cash tender offer of our first mortgage notes due in 2017 and the write-off of related unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount.
we incurred a loss of $4.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from the decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swaps compared to a gain of $14.2 million from the increase in fair value for the same period in 2013.
interest income was $20.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $15.7 million for the same period in 2013. during 2014 and 2013, our short-term investment strategy has been to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. the majority of our short-term investments were in time deposits, fixed deposits and money market accounts with a maturity of three months or less.
income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded a tax benefit of $3.8 million and $17.6 million, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2014, our benefit for income taxes primarily relates to a release of valuation allowance on prior year foreign tax credits resulting from the implementation of a tax planning strategy. for the year ended december 31, 2013, our income tax benefit is primarily related to a decrease in our deferred tax liabilities reduced by foreign taxes assessable on the dividends of wynn macau sa. since june 30, 2010, we have no longer considered our portion of the tax earnings and profits of wynn macau, limited to be permanently reinvested. no additional u.s. tax provision has been made with respect to amounts not considered permanently reinvested as we anticipate that u.s. foreign tax credits should be sufficient to eliminate any u.s. tax provision relating to such repatriation. we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences which are considered indefinitely reinvested.
wynn macau sa received an exemption from macau's 12% complementary tax on casino gaming profits through december 31, 2015. accordingly, we were exempt from the payment of $99.4 million and $107.3 million in such taxes during the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. our non-gaming profits remain subject to the macau complementary tax and casino winnings remain subject to the macau special gaming tax and other levies together totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement.

in december 2013, we received notification that for the 2014 tax year we had been accepted for the compliance maintenance phase of the internal revenue service ("irs") compliance assurance program ("cap"), which accelerates irs examination of key transactions with the goal of resolving any issues before the taxpayer files its return. in the compliance maintenance phase, the irs, at its discretion, may reduce the level of review of the taxpayer's tax positions based on the complexity and number of issues, and the taxpayer's history of compliance, cooperation and transparency in the cap.
in february 2014, we received notification that the irs completed its examination of our 2012 u.s. income tax return and had no changes. in december 2014, we received notification that we were accepted into the compliance maintenance phase of cap for the 2015 tax year.

entertainment, retail and other revenues were relatively flat at $418.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared $417.2 million for the same period in 2012. an increase in retail revenues at our macau operations from stronger business in leased stores and las vegas operations with the completed reconfiguration of certain stores in our retail area during 2012 was offset by a decrease in entertainment revenues. decline in entertainment revenues was driven by a las vegas show which ended its run in november 2012.
operating costs and expenses operating costs and expenses increased 5.0%, or $205.8 million, to $4,330.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, from $4,125.0 million for the same period of 2012.
casino expenses increased 8.4%, or $219.7 million, to $2,846.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, from $2,626.8 million for the same period of 2012. the increase was due primarily to higher gaming taxes commensurate with the increase in casino revenue at our las vegas operations and macau operations (where we incur a gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling 39% in accordance with the concession agreement).
food and beverage expenses increased 4.9%, or $15.2 million, to $323.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, from $308.4 million for the same period of 2012. the increase in food and beverage expenses is primarily due to additional nightclub promotional costs at our las vegas operations.
entertainment, retail and other expenses decreased 7.7%, or $14.6 million, to $175.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, from $189.8 million for the same period of 2012 due primarily to a las vegas show that ended its run in november 2012.
general and administrative expenses increased 1.6%, or $7.1 million, to $448.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $441.7 million in the same period of 2012. the increase was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of a restricted stock award that was previously granted to our former chief operating officer and increased development costs. the increase was partially offset by higher expenses incurred during the prior year related to the share redemption and litigation with a former shareholder.
49
provision for doubtful accounts decreased 34.3%, or $6.2 million, to $11.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, from $18.1 million for the same period of 2012. during years ended 2013 and 2012, we recorded adjustments of $14.9 million and $30.9 million, respectively, to our reserve estimates for casino accounts receivable based on the results of historical collection patterns and current collection trends.
pre-opening costs were $3.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, compared to $0.5 million for the same period of 2012 and were attributable to wynn palace. we began to incur pre-opening costs during october 2012 related to the design and planning for wynn palace.
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31, 2013, was $371.1 million compared to $373.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. during the construction of our resorts, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. once these resorts opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. in addition, we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment, intangible assets and other assets and adjust them when warranted. the maximum useful life of assets at our macau operations is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire in june 2022 and august 2029, respectively. consequently, depreciation related to our macau operations is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to our las vegas operations.
property charges and other property charges and other for the year ended december 31, 2013, was $17.1 million compared to $40.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. for the year ended december 31, 2013, property charges and other related primarily to miscellaneous renovations and abandonments at our resorts, a contract termination fee and entertainment development costs. for the year ended december 31, 2012, property charges and other related primarily to a remodel of a las vegas restaurant, charges related to the cancellation of a las vegas show which ended its run in november 2012, and miscellaneous renovations and abandonments.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest interest expense was $299.0 million, net of capitalized interest of $10.5 million, for the year ended december 31, 2013, compared to $288.8 million, net of capitalized interest of $2.0 million, for the year ended december 31, 2012. our interest expense increased compared to the prior year period primarily due to the issuance of $500 million 4 1/4% senior notes in may 2013 and a full period of expense for the $1.94 billion redemption note and $900 million 5 3/8% first mortgage notes, which were issued in 2012. capitalized interest increased due to the construction costs of wynn palace.
other non-operating costs and expenses interest income was $15.7 million and $12.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. this increase is mainly due to higher cash balances during 2013. during 2013 and 2012, our short-term investment strategy was to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. the majority of our short-term investments were primarily in money market accounts, time deposits and fixed deposits with a maturity of three months or less.
we recorded a gain of $14.2 million and $1.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012, respectively, resulting from the changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps during those years.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recognized $40.4 million in loss from extinguishment of debt. on may 22, 2013, wynn las vegas completed the purchase of $274.7 million of the 7 7/8% first mortgage notes due 2017 (the "2017 notes") pursuant to a tender offer for any and all of the 2017 notes. in connection with this tender offer, wynn las vegas, llc paid $19.6 million in consideration to holders who tendered their notes. additionally, wynn las vegas, llc expensed $6.7 million of unamortized financing costs and original issue discount related to the 2017 notes and incurred other fees of approximately $0.3 million related to the tender offer. on november 1, 2013, wynn las vegas, llc redeemed the untendered 2017 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. as a result of the redemption, we incurred redemption fees of $8.9 million and expensed $4.9 million of unamortized financing costs and original issue discount.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we recognized $25.2 million in loss from extinguishment of debt primarily attributable to the amendment of our credit agreements. in march 2012, wynn las vegas, llc entered into an eighth amendment to its amended and restated credit agreement (the "wynn las vegas credit agreement"). in connection with this
50
amendment, wynn las vegas, llc prepaid all term loans under the wynn las vegas credit agreement, terminated all of its revolving credit commitments that were due to expire in 2013, and terminated all but $100 million of its revolving credit commitments expiring in 2015. in connection with this transaction, we expensed deferred financing fees of $4.8 million. additionally, as described in item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 8 "long-term debt" to our consolidated financial statements, we amended our wynn macau credit facilities in july 2012. in connection with amending the wynn macau credit facilities, we expensed $17.7 million of deferred financing costs and third party fees.
income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2013, we recorded a tax benefit of $17.6 million, and for the year ended december 31, 2012, we recorded a tax expense of $4.3 million. our income tax benefit was primarily related to a decrease in our deferred tax liabilities reduced by foreign taxes assessable on the dividends of wynn macau sa. since june 30, 2010, we have no longer considered our portion of the tax earnings and profits of wynn macau, limited to be permanently reinvested. no additional u.s. tax provision has been made with respect to amounts not considered permanently reinvested as we anticipate that u.s. foreign tax credits should be sufficient to eliminate any u.s. tax provision relating to such repatriation. we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences which are considered indefinitely reinvested.
on november 30, 2010, wynn macau sa received an exemption from macau's 12% complementary tax on casino gaming profits, thereby exempting the casino gaming profits of wynn macau sa through december 31, 2015. accordingly, we were exempted from the payment of approximately $107.3 million and $87.1 million in such taxes for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. our non-gaming profits remain subject to the macau complementary tax and casino winnings remain subject to the macau special gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement.
in april 2012, the company reached an agreement with the appellate division of the irs regarding issues raised during the examination of the 2006 through 2009 u.s. income tax returns. the settlement with the appellate division did not impact the company's unrecognized tax benefits. the settlement of the 2006 through 2009 examination issues resulted in a cash tax payment of $1.3 million and the utilization of $3.1 million and $0.9 million in foreign tax credit and general business credit carryforwards, respectively.
during december 2012, the irs completed an examination of the company's 2010 u.s. income tax return and had no changes. in may 2013, the company received notification that the irs completed its examination of the company's 2011 u.s. income tax return and had no changes.

adjusted property ebitda we use adjusted property ebitda to manage the operating results of our segments. adjusted property ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, corporate expenses, intercompany golf course and water rights leases, stock-based compensation, and other non-operating income and expenses, and includes equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates. adjusted property ebitda is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. we use adjusted property ebitda as a measure of the operating performance of our segments and to compare the operating performance of our properties with those of our competitors. we also present adjusted property ebitda because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. gaming companies have historically reported ebitda as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). in order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their ebitda calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. however, adjusted property ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with gaap. unlike net income, adjusted property ebitda does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. we have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted property ebitda. also, our calculation of adjusted property ebitda may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
the following table summarizes adjusted property ebitda (in thousands) for our macau and las vegas operations as reviewed by management and summarized in item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 18 "segment information." that footnote also presents a reconciliation of adjusted property ebitda to net income.

adjusted property ebitda at our macau operations decreased year-over-year by 5.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 due to decline in vip turnover, partially offset by an increase in table games win from our mass market gaming operations. adjusted property ebitda at our las vegas operations increased year-over-year by 5.9% for the year ended december 31, 2014 driven by our non-casino revenue performance.
adjusted property ebitda at our macau and las vegas operations increased year-over-year by 13.4% and 19.1% for the year ended december 31, 2013, respectively. both benefited from stronger operating results primarily in the casino department due to an increase in table games volume and win percentage.
refer to the discussions above regarding the specific details of our results of operations.
liquidity and capital resources operating activities our operating cash flows primarily consist of our operating income generated by our macau and las vegas operations (excluding depreciation and other non-cash charges), interest paid and earned, and changes in working capital accounts such as receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses, and payables. our table games play both in macau and las vegas is a mix of cash play and credit play, while our slot machine play is conducted primarily on a cash basis. a significant portion of our table games revenue is attributable to the play of a limited number of premium international customers that gamble on credit. the ability to collect these gaming receivables may impact our operating cash flow for the period. our rooms, food and beverage, and entertainment, retail, and other revenue is conducted primarily on a cash basis or as a trade receivable. accordingly, operating cash flows will be impacted by changes in operating income and accounts receivables.

net cash provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $1,098.3 million compared to $1,676.6 million provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2013. the decline in cash provided by operations was primarily due to a decrease in our accounts payable, accrued expenses and customer deposits and from a reduction in operating income driven by our casino revenue results. net cash provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2013 was $1,676.6 million compared to $1,185.7 million provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2012. cash flow from operations improved due to significant changes in ordinary working capital accounts such as accounts payable and accrued expenses. also benefiting operating cash flow for the year ended december 31, 2013 was increased operating income that was driven primarily by stronger operating results in the casino department.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $1,114.4 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $677.6 million for the same period in 2013. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we had $1,127.0 million in capital expenditures, net of construction payables and retention, primarily for wynn palace construction. in addition, we used $218.9 million in cash for deposits primarily associated with the wynn palace construction and for payment of our massachusetts gaming license. net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 was partially offset by proceeds of $198.9 million provided by restricted cash that we applied to repayment of certain wynn palace related construction and development costs. the primary use of cash for the year ended december 31, 2013 was $506.8 million for capital expenditures related to site preparation costs for wynn palace land and various renovations at our resorts including wynn macau guest room renovations.
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2012 was $344.9 million. during 2012, our primary uses were capital expenditures of $241.0 million and the restriction of $99.2 million in proceeds from our debt instruments for the payment of certain wynn palace related construction and development costs. capital expenditures included site preparation costs for the wynn palace land, a one-time payment in consideration of an unrelated third party's relinquishment of certain rights in and future development on the wynn palace land, remodel of two las vegas restaurants and the conversion of certain storage and office areas in macau to two new retail outlets.
financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities was $235.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, mainly due to the payment of dividends of $942.9 million and payments on our long-term debt, primarily offset by proceeds of $755.6 million from the issuance of senior notes and $132.6 million from borrowings, net of repayments, under our wynn macau revolving credit facility. during 2014, we used $98.4 million for open market purchases of principal on our first mortgage notes and $31.5 million for the repayment of remaining principal on our note payable secured by aircraft.
net cash flows used in financing activities of $291.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 was primarily for the payment of dividends of $1,035.0 million and the redemption of first mortgage notes of $500.0 million, offset by proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $1,100.0 million and the increase in our senior term loan facility of $200.0 million.
net cash flows used in financing activities were $382.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, which was primarily attributable to principal payments of $1,022.8 million on term loan facilities and payment of dividends of $955.5 million, partially offset by proceeds of $1,648.6 million from the issuance of first mortgage notes of $900.0 million and proceeds of $748.6 million from the fully funded senior term loan facility.
capital resources at december 31, 2014, we had approximately $2,182.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $250.3 million of available-for-sale investments in domestic debt securities. cash and cash equivalents include cash in bank and fixed deposits, investments in money market funds, domestic and foreign bank time deposits and commercial paper, all with maturities of less than 90 days. of these amounts, wynn macau, limited and its subsidiaries held $1,391.0 million in cash, of which we own 72%. if our portion of this cash was repatriated to the u.s. on december 31, 2014, approximately 72% of this amount would be subject to u.s. tax in the year of repatriation. wynn resorts, limited, which is not a guarantor of the debt of its subsidiaries, held $524.8 million (including cash of its subsidiaries other than those of wynn las vegas, llc and wynn macau, limited) and $250.3 million of cash and available-for-sale investments, respectively. wynn las vegas, llc held cash balances of $266.4 million.
53
we expect that our future cash needs will relate primarily to the funding of our development projects, debt service and retirement, general corporate purposes and enhancements to our operating resorts. we intend to primarily fund our development projects with the available borrowing capacity under our bank credit facilities.
the wynn macau credit facilities consist of a $950 million equivalent fully funded senior secured term loan facility and a $1.55 billion equivalent senior secured revolving credit facility (together, the "wynn macau credit facilities"). borrowings under the wynn macau credit facilities, which consist of both hong kong and united states dollar tranches, will be used to fund the design, development, construction and pre-opening expenses of wynn palace, and for general corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2014, the company had $1.42 billion of available borrowing capacity under the senior secured revolving credit facility.
the wynn america credit facilities consist of a $375 million senior secured revolving credit facility and an $875 million delay draw senior secured term loan facility (together, the "wynn america credit facilities"). borrowings under the wynn america credit facilities will be used to fund the design, development, construction and pre-opening expenses of the wynn resort in massachusetts and for other general corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2014, there were no amounts drawn under the wynn america credit facilities, however there were outstanding letters of credit totaling $8.9 million reducing the available borrowing capacity to $1.24 billion.
we believe that cash flow from operations, availability under our bank credit facilities and our existing cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. if any additional financing becomes necessary, we cannot provide assurance that future borrowings will be available.
macau related debt our macau related debt consists of senior notes and the wynn macau credit facilities.
on march 20, 2014, wynn macau, limited ("wml"), an indirect subsidiary of wynn resorts, limited, issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5 1/4% senior notes due 2021 (the "additional 2021 notes"), which were consolidated and form a single series with the $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5 1/4% senior notes due 2021 issued by wml on october 16, 2013 (the "original 2021 notes" and together with the "additional 2021 notes", the "2021 notes"). wml received net proceeds of approximately $748.8 million after adding the original issue premium and deducting commissions and expenses of the offering. wml will use the net proceeds for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes.
the additional 2021 notes have the same terms and conditions as those of the original 2021 notes. the 2021 notes will bear interest at the rate of 5 1/4% per annum and will mature on october 15, 2021. interest on the 2021 notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on april 15 and october 15 of each year, beginning on april 15, 2014. at any time on or before october 14, 2016, wml may redeem the 2021 notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 notes or (b) a "make-whole" amount as determined by an independent investment banker in accordance with the terms of the indenture for the 2021 notes, dated as of october 16, 2013 (the "wml indenture"). in either case, the redemption price would include accrued and unpaid interest. in addition, on or after october 15, 2016, wml may redeem the 2021 notes, in whole or in part, at a premium decreasing annually from 103.94% of the principal amount to zero, plus accrued and unpaid interest. if wml undergoes a change of control (as defined in the wml indenture), it must offer to repurchase the 2021 notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. in addition, the company may redeem the 2021 notes, in whole but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, in response to any change in or amendment to certain tax laws or tax positions. further, if a holder or beneficial owner of the 2021 notes fails to meet certain requirements imposed by any gaming authority (as defined in the wml indenture), wml may require the holder or beneficial owner to dispose of or redeem its 2021 notes.
the 2021 notes are wml's general unsecured obligations and rank pari passu in right of payment with all of wml's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness; will rank senior to all of wml's future subordinated indebtedness, if any; will be effectively subordinated to all of wml's future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt; and will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of wml's subsidiaries, including wynn macau credit facilities' existing credit facilities. the 2021 notes are not registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), and the 2021 notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale.
the wml indenture contains covenants limiting wml's (and certain of its subsidiaries') ability to, among other things: merge or consolidate with another company; transfer or sell all or substantially all of its properties or assets; and lease all or substantially all of its properties or assets. the terms of the wml indenture contain customary events of default, including, but
54
not limited to: default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the 2021 notes; default in the payment when due of the principal of, or premium, if any, on the 2021 notes; failure to comply with any payment obligations relating to the repurchase by wml of the 2021 notes upon a change of control; failure to comply with certain covenants in the wml indenture; certain defaults on certain other indebtedness; failure to pay judgments against wml or certain subsidiaries that, in the aggregate, exceed $50 million; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. in the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all 2021 notes then outstanding will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice.
under the wynn macau credit facilities, the revolving credit facility matures in july 2017 and the term loan facility matures in july 2018. the principal amount of the term loan is required to be repaid in two equal installments in july 2017 and july 2018. the wynn macau credit facilities bear interest for the first six months after closing at libor or hibor plus a margin of 2.50% and thereafter is subject to libor or hibor plus a margin of between 1.75% to 2.50% based on wynn macau sa's leverage ratio. the annual fee required to pay for unborrowed amounts, if any, is 0.61% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, calculated based on the daily average of the unborrowed amounts under such credit facilities.
borrowings under the wynn macau credit facilities are guaranteed by palo, a subsidiary of wynn macau sa, and by certain subsidiaries of the company that own equity interests in wynn macau sa, and are secured by substantially all of the assets of wynn macau sa, the equity interests in wynn macau sa and substantially all of the assets of palo.
the wynn macau credit facilities contain a requirement that wynn macau sa must make mandatory repayments of indebtedness from specified percentages of excess cash flow. if wynn macau sa meets a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the wynn macau credit facilities, of greater than 4.0 to 1, such repayment is defined as 50% of excess cash flow, as defined in the wynn macau credit facilities. if the consolidated leverage ratio is equal or less than 4.0 to 1, then no repayment is required.
the wynn macau credit facilities contain customary covenants restricting certain activities including, but not limited to: the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence or creation of liens on any of its property, sale and leaseback transactions, the ability to dispose of assets, and making loans or other investments. in addition, wynn macau sa was required by the financial covenants to maintain a leverage ratio, as defined in the wynn macau credit facilities, of not greater than 4.5 to 1 as of december 31, 2014, and an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the wynn macau credit facilities, of not less than 2.00 to 1.
in connection with the initial financing of wynn macau sa, wynn macau sa entered into a bank guarantee reimbursement agreement with banco nacional ultramarino, s.a. ("bnu") for the benefit of the macau government. this guarantee assures wynn macau sa's performance under the casino concession agreement, including the payment of premiums, fines and indemnity for any material failure to perform under the terms of the concession agreement. as of december 31, 2014, the guarantee was in the amount of 300 million macau patacas (approximately $37 million) and will remain at such amount until 180 days after the end of the term of the concession agreement (2022). bnu, as issuer of the guarantee, is currently secured by a second priority security interest in the senior lender collateral package. from and after repayment of all indebtedness under the wynn macau credit facilities, wynn macau sa is obligated to promptly, upon demand by bnu, repay any claim made on the guarantee by the macau government. bnu is paid an annual fee for the guarantee of approximately 2.3 million macau patacas (approximately $0.3 million).
u.s. and corporate related debt our u.s. related debt consists of first mortgage notes, senior notes and the wynn america credit facilities. the corporate related debt consists of the redemption price promissory note ("redemption note").
the first mortgage notes are issued by wynn las vegas, llc and wynn las vegas capital corp., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of wynn resorts, limited (together, the "issuers"). our first mortgage notes are senior obligations of the issuers and are unsecured (except by the first priority pledge by wynn resorts holdings, llc of its equity interests in wynn las vegas, llc (the "holdings pledge"). these issuances rank pari passu in right of payment with each issuance and are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. if the issuers undergo a change of control, they must offer to repurchase the first mortgage notes at 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. the indentures governing the first mortgage notes contain customary negative covenants and financial covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict wynn las vegas, llc's ability to: pay dividends or distributions or repurchase equity; incur additional debt; make investments; create liens on assets to secure debt; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate with another company; transfer and sell assets or create dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries.
55
in february 2015, the issuers commenced a cash tender offer for any and all of the outstanding aggregate principal amounts of the 7 3/4% first mortgage notes and the 7 7/8% first mortgage notes (together the "2020 notes"). separately, the issuers completed the issuance of $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 5 1/2% senior notes due 2025 (the "2025 notes"). we used the net proceeds from the 2025 notes to cover the cost of purchasing the 2020 notes tendered in the tender offer. we also satisfied and discharged the indentures under which the 2020 notes were issued and will use the remaining net proceeds to redeem the 2020 notes not tendered and for general corporate purposes. for more information on the cash tender offer of the 2020 notes and the issuance of the 2025 notes, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 20 "subsequent events".
in may 2013, the issuers completed the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4 1/4% senior notes due 2023 (the "2023 notes") pursuant to an indenture, dated as of may 22, 2013 (the "2023 indenture"), among the issuers, the guarantors (as defined below) and u.s. bank national association, as trustee. the 2023 notes were issued at par. the issuers used the net proceeds from the 2023 notes to cover the cost of purchasing the 2017 notes tendered in a tender offer. in addition, the issuers satisfied and discharged the 2017 indenture and, in november 2013, used the remaining net proceeds to redeem all of the 2017 notes not previously tendered. in connection with the issuance of the 2023 notes, the company capitalized approximately $4.1 million of financing costs.
the 2023 notes will mature on may 30, 2023 and bear interest at the rate of 4 1/4% per annum. the issuers may, at their option, redeem the 2023 notes, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time prior to their stated maturity. the redemption price for 2023 notes that are redeemed before february 28, 2023 will include a make-whole premium. the 2023 notes are also subject to mandatory redemption requirements imposed by gaming laws and regulations of gaming authorities in nevada.
the 2023 notes are the issuers' senior unsecured obligations and rank pari passu in right of payment with the issuers' first mortgage notes. the 2023 notes are secured by a first priority pledge of the company's equity interests. the equity interests of the company also secure the first mortgage notes. if wynn resorts, limited receives an investment grade rating from one or more ratings agencies, the first priority pledge securing the 2023 notes will be released.
the 2023 notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by all of the issuers' subsidiaries, other than wynn las vegas capital corp. which was a co-issuer (the "guarantors"). the guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of the guarantors and rank senior in right of payment to all of their existing and future subordinated debt. the guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future liabilities of the guarantors that are not so subordinated and will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of such guarantors' existing and future secured debt (to the extent of the collateral securing such debt).
the 2023 indenture contains covenants limiting the issuers' and the guarantors' ability to create liens on assets to secure debt; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; and merge or consolidate with another company. these covenants are subject to a number of important and significant limitations, qualifications and exceptions.
on november 20, 2014, wynn america, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, and certain subsidiaries of wynn america entered into a $1.25 billion senior secured credit facility. borrowings under the wynn america credit facilities will be used by us primarily to fund the design, development, construction and pre-opening expenses of the wynn resort in massachusetts and for other general corporate purposes.
the revolving credit facility matures in november 2019. the term loan facility matures in november 2020 and will require quarterly principal payments, scheduled to begin in june 2018. subject to certain exceptions, the wynn america credit facilities bear interest at either base rate plus 0.75% per annum or the reserve adjusted eurodollar rate plus 1.75% per annum. the annual fee required to pay for unborrowed amounts, if any, is 0.30% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, calculated based on the daily average of the unborrowed amounts under such credit facilities.
certain subsidiaries of wynn america will guarantee the obligation of wynn america under the credit facilities. wynn america has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause a series of corporate restructurings and related transactions, including receipt of gaming approvals from relevant gaming authorities, pursuant to which wynn las vegas, llc and its subsidiaries will become subsidiaries of wynn las vegas holdings, llc, a direct subsidiary of wynn america (the "wynn las vegas reorganization"). upon the consummation of the wynn las vegas reorganization (including receipt of all approvals required under applicable gaming laws and regulations), wynn las vegas, llc and its subsidiaries shall be restricted subsidiaries under the credit facilities but shall not guarantee the obligations of wynn america until such time, and then only to such extent, as may be permitted by any then existing wynn las vegas, llc's senior secured notes.
56
the wynn america credit facilities contain customary representation and warranties, events of default and negative and affirmative covenants, including, among other things, limitations on: indebtedness; investments; restricted payments; mergers and acquisitions; payments of indebtedness; negative pledges; liens; transactions with affiliates and sales of assets. in addition, wynn america is subject to financial covenants including maintaining a maximum consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated ebitda, each as defined in the wynn america credit facilities. commencing with the second full fiscal quarter ending after the fiscal quarter in which the opening of the wynn resort in massachusetts occurs, the maximum consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio is not to exceed 2.75 to 1. commencing with the first full fiscal quarter ending with the fiscal quarter in which the wynn las vegas reorganization occurs, the minimum consolidated ebitda is not to be less than $200.0 million.
the company has provided a completion guaranty in favor of the lenders under the wynn america credit facilities to support the development and opening of the wynn resort in massachusetts.
wynn america and the guarantors have entered into a security agreement in favor of the lenders under the wynn america credit facilities pursuant to which, subject to certain exceptions, wynn america and the guarantors have pledged all equity interests in the guarantors to the extent permitted by applicable law and granted a first priority security interest in substantially all of the other existing and future assets of the guarantors.
based on the board of director's finding of "unsuitability," on february 18, 2012, we redeemed and canceled aruze's 24,549,222 shares of wynn resorts' common stock. following a finding of "unsuitability," our articles of incorporation authorize redemption at "fair value" of the shares held by unsuitable persons. pursuant to the articles of incorporation, we issued the redemption note to aruze, a former stockholder and related party, in redemption of the shares. the redemption note has a principal amount of approximately $1.94 billion, matures on february 18, 2022 and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum, payable annually in arrears on each anniversary of the date of the redemption note. we may, in our sole and absolute discretion, at any time and from time to time, and without penalty or premium, prepay the whole or any portion of the principal or interest due under the redemption note. in no instance shall any payment obligation under the redemption note be accelerated except in the sole and absolute discretion of wynn resorts or as specifically mandated by law. the indebtedness evidenced by the redemption note, to the prior payment in full of all existing and future obligations of wynn resorts and any of its affiliates in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money of any kind or nature. aruze, universal entertainment corporation and kazuo okada have challenged the redemption of aruze's shares and we are currently involved in litigation with those parties as well as related shareholder derivative litigation. the outcome of these various proceedings cannot be predicted. any adverse judgments or settlements involving payment of a material sum of money could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could expose us to additional claims by third parties, including current or former investors or regulators. any adverse judgments or settlements would reduce our profits and could limit our ability to operate our business. see item 1a-"risk factors", item 3-"legal proceedings" and item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 17 "commitments and contingencies".
other factors affecting liquidity wynn resorts is a holding company and, as a result, our ability to pay dividends is highly dependent on our ability to obtain funds and our subsidiaries' ability to provide funds to us. restrictions imposed by our wynn las vegas, llc, wynn america and wynn macau sa debt instruments restrict our ability to pay dividends. specifically, wynn las vegas, llc and certain of its subsidiaries are restricted under the indentures governing its first mortgage notes from making certain "restricted payments" as defined in the indentures. these restricted payments include the payment of dividends or distributions to any direct or indirect holders of equity interests of wynn las vegas, llc. these restricted payments may not be made unless certain financial and non-financial criteria have been satisfied. the wynn macau credit facilities contain similar restrictions, including a specified leverage ratio, which must be met in order to pay dividends and wynn macau is presently able to pay dividends in accordance with the wynn macau credit facilities.
wynn las vegas, llc intends to fund its operations and capital requirements from cash on hand and operating cash flow. we cannot assure you however, that our las vegas operations will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or the availability of additional indebtedness will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay wynn las vegas, llc's indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. similarly, we expect that our macau operations will fund wynn macau, limited's debt service obligations with existing cash, operating cash flow and availability under the wynn macau credit facilities. however, we cannot assure you that operating cash flows will be sufficient to do so. we may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.

legal proceedings in which we are involved also may impact our liquidity. no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of such proceedings. in addition, litigation inherently involves significant costs. for information regarding legal proceedings, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 17 "commitments and contingencies".
we have in the past repurchased, and in the future, we may periodically consider repurchasing our outstanding notes for cash. the amount of any notes to be repurchased, as well as the timing of any repurchases, will be based on business, market and other conditions and factors, including price, contractual requirements or consents, and capital availability. any repurchases might be made using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or by any combination of those methods, in compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations.
our board of directors has authorized an equity repurchase program of up to $1.7 billion. the repurchase program may include repurchases from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, and under plans complying with rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the exchange act. as of december 31, 2014, we had purchased a cumulative total of 12,804,954 shares of our common stock for a net cost of $1.1 billion under the program, with no purchases made under this program during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
new business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. we continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in domestic and international markets. there can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. any new development would require us to obtain additional financing. we may decide to conduct any such development through wynn resorts or through subsidiaries separate from the las vegas or macau-related entities.
the company's articles of incorporation provide that, to the extent required by the gaming authority making the determination of unsuitability or to the extent the board of directors determines, in its sole discretion, that a person is likely to jeopardize the company's or any affiliate's application for, receipt of, approval for, right to the use of, or entitlement to, any gaming license, shares of wynn resorts' capital stock that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates are subject to redemption by the company. the redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as we elect. any promissory note that we issue to an unsuitable person or its affiliate in exchange for its shares could increase our debt to equity ratio and would increase our leverage ratio.
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor do we engage in any derivatives except for previously discussed interest rate swaps. we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. at december 31, 2014, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $8.9 million.

(1)   amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon amounts outstanding and libor or hibor rates at december 31, 2014. such rates continue at historical lows as of december 31, 2014. actual rates will vary.
58
(2)   other includes open purchase orders, future charitable contributions, fixed gaming tax payments in macau, aircraft purchase obligations and other contracts. as further discussed in item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 16 "income taxes", of this report, we had $88.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2014. due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year and therefore it is not included in the table above as of december 31, 2014.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. a summary of our significant accounting policies are presented in item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies". certain of our accounting policies require management to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. on an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates, including those relating to the estimated lives of depreciable assets, asset impairment, allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals for customer loyalty programs, contingencies, litigation and other items. judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. however, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.
development, construction and property and equipment estimates during the construction and development of a resort, pre-opening or start-up costs are expensed when incurred. in connection with the construction and development of our resorts, significant start-up costs are incurred and charged to pre-opening costs through their respective openings. once our resorts open, expenses associated with the opening of the resorts are no longer charged as pre-opening costs.
during the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of our resorts, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized. accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment increase significantly during construction periods. depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs is recognized when the related assets are placed in service. upon the opening of our resorts, we began recognizing depreciation expense on the resort's fixed assets. the remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed.
our leasehold interest in land in macau under the land concession contracts entered into in august 2004 and may 2012 are being amortized over 25 years, to the initial term of the concession contract, which currently terminate in august 2029 and may 2037. depreciation on a majority of the assets comprising wynn macau commenced in september of 2006, when wynn macau opened. the maximum useful life of assets at wynn macau is deemed to be the remaining life of the land concession which currently expires in august 2029, or the gaming concession which currently expires in june 2022. consequently, depreciation related to wynn macau will generally be charged over shorter periods when compared to wynn las vegas.
costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. the cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in property charges and other.
we also evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting standards. for assets to be disposed of, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. for assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. in reviewing for impairment, we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. if an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. all recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.
redemption price promissory note in connection with the redemption of the shares previously held by aruze, we recorded the fair value of the redemption note of approximately $1.94 billion in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. we utilized an independent third party valuation to assist in the determination of this fair value. in determining this fair value, we estimated the redemption note's
59
present value using discounted cash flows with a probability weighted expected return for redemption assumptions and a discount rate which included time value and non-performance risk adjustments commensurate with risk of the redemption note.
considerations for the redemption assumptions included the stated maturity of the redemption note, uncertainty of the related cash flows as well as potential effects of the following: uncertainties surrounding the potential outcome and timing of pending litigation with the okada parties (see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 17 "commitments and contingencies"); the outcome of on-going investigations of aruze by the united states attorney's office, the u.s. department of justice and the nevada gaming control board; and other potential legal and regulatory actions. in addition, in the furtherance of various future business objectives, we considered our ability, at our sole option, to prepay the redemption note at any time in accordance with its terms without penalty. accordingly, we reasonably determined that the estimated life of the redemption note could be less than the contractual life of the redemption note.
in determination of the appropriate discount rate to be used in the estimated present value, the redemption note's subordinated position relative to all other debt in our capital structure and credit ratings associated with our traded debt were considered. observable inputs for the risk free rate based on federal reserve rates for u.s. treasury securities and credit risk spread based on a yield curve index of similarly rated debt were used. as a result of this analysis, we concluded the redemption notes' stated rate of 2% approximated a market rate.
investments and fair value we have made investments in domestic and foreign corporate debt securities and commercial paper. our investment policy requires investments to be investment grade and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. we determine the appropriate classification (held-to-maturity/available-for-sale) of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date. our investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income (loss). adjustments are made for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method. such amortization is included in interest income together with realized gains and losses and the stated interest on such securities.
we measure certain of our financial assets and liabilities, such as cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities and interest rate swaps, at fair value on a recurring basis pursuant to accounting standards for fair value measurements. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. these accounting standards establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. these tiers include: level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
we obtain pricing information in determining the fair value of our available-for-sale securities from independent pricing vendors. based on our inquiries, the pricing vendors use various pricing models consistent with what other market participants would use. the assumptions and inputs used by the pricing vendors are derived from market observable sources including: reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark curves, bids, offers and other market-related data. we have not made adjustments to such prices. each quarter, we validate the fair value pricing methodology to determine the fair value consistent with applicable accounting guidance and to confirm that the securities are classified properly in the fair value hierarchy. we also compare the pricing received from our vendors to independent sources for the same or similar securities.
allowance for estimated doubtful accounts receivable a substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. credit play, through the issuance of markers, represents a significant portion of the table games volume at our las vegas operations. while offered, the issuance of credit at our macau operations is less significant when compared to las vegas. our goal is to maintain strict controls over the issuance of credit and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their balances in a timely fashion. these collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. markers issued at our las vegas operations are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states, and united states assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the united states.
the enforceability of markers and other forms of credit related to gaming debt outside of the united states varies from country to country. some foreign countries do not recognize the enforceability of gaming related debt, or make enforcement
60
burdensome. we closely consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when issuing credit to customers who are not residents of the united states. in addition to our internal credit and collection departments, located in both las vegas and macau, we have a network of legal, accounting and collection professionals to assist us in our determinations regarding enforceability and our overall collection efforts.
as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, approximately 85% and 86% of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries, primarily in asia. in addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers' home countries.
we regularly evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts as well as management's prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions. in determining our allowance for estimated doubtful accounts receivable, we apply loss factors based on historical marker collection history to aged account balances and we specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age, the customer's financial condition, collection history and any other known information.
the following table presents key statistics related to our casino accounts receivable (in thousands):
december 31,
2014                                                                                                  2013
casino accounts receivable                                              $257,930              $252,998
allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable                        $74,149               $73,561
allowance as a percentage of casino accounts receivable                     28.7   %              29.1   %
percentage of casino accounts receivable outstanding over 180 days          32.5   %              30.3   %
our reserve for doubtful casino accounts receivable is based on our estimates of amounts collectible and depends on the risk assessments and judgments by management regarding realizability, the state of the economy and our credit policy. in june 2014, the company recorded an adjustment to its reserve estimates for casino accounts receivable based on the results of historical collection patterns and current collection trends. for the year ended december 31, 2014, this adjustment benefited operating income by $8.7 million and net income attributable to wynn resorts, limited by $6.8 million (or $0.07 per share on a fully diluted basis). for the year ended december 31, 2013, this adjustment benefited operating income by $30.9 million and net income attributable to wynn resorts, limited by $23.3 million (or $0.22 per share on a fully diluted basis). our reserve methodology is applied similarly to credit extended at each of our resorts. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, approximately 28.2% and 24.8%, respectively, of our outstanding casino account receivable balance originated at our macau operations.
at december 31, 2014, a 100 basis-point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change the provision for doubtful accounts by approximately $2.6 million.
as our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad debts. accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts expense may fluctuate. because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods, as we become aware of additional information about a customer or changes occur in a region's economy or legal system.
derivative financial instruments we seek to manage our market risk, including interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments. we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with applicable accounting standards. derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value affecting net income. as of december 31, 2014, changes in our interest rate swap fair values are being recorded in our consolidated statements of income, as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting.
we measure the fair value of our interest rate swaps on a recurring basis. we categorize our interest rate swap contracts as level 2 in the hierarchy as described above. the fair value approximates the amount we would receive (pay) if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. we adjust this amount by applying a non-performance valuation, considering our creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of our counterparties at each settlement date, as applicable.
61
stock-based compensation accounting standards for stock-based payments establish standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entity's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. it requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. we use the black-scholes option pricing model to determine grant-date fair value of our stock options. the black-scholes model uses assumptions of expected volatility, risk-free interest rates, the expected term of options granted, and expected rates of dividends. management determines these assumptions by reviewing current market rates, making industry comparisons and reviewing conditions relevant to our company.
the expected volatility and expected term assumptions can significantly impact the fair value of stock options. we believe that the valuation techniques and the approach utilized to develop our assumptions are reasonable in calculating the fair value of the options we grant. we estimate the expected stock price volatility using a combination of implied and historical factors related to our stock price in accordance with applicable accounting standards. as our stock price fluctuates, this estimate will change. a hypothetical 10% change in the volatility assumption for the 25,800 options granted in 2014 would not have a material effect on the change in fair value. expected term represents the estimated average time between the option's grant date and its exercise date. a hypothetical 10% change in the expected term assumption for the 25,800 options granted in 2014 would not have a material effect on the change in fair value. these assumed changes in fair value would have been recognized over the vesting schedule of such awards.
accounting standards also require the classification of stock compensation expense in the same financial statement line items as cash compensation, and therefore impacts our departmental expenses (and related operating margins), pre-opening costs and construction in progress for our development projects, and our general and administrative expenses (including corporate expenses).
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. accounting standards require the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. accounting standards require recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.
as of december 31, 2014, we have a foreign tax credit carryover of $3,284 million and we have recorded a valuation allowance of $3,242 million against this asset based on our estimate of future realization. the foreign tax credits are attributable to the macau special gaming tax which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in macau. the u.s. taxing regime only allows a credit for 35% of "net" foreign source income. due to our recent operating history of u.s. losses, we currently do not rely on forecasted taxable income in order to support the utilization of the foreign tax credits. we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax asset for foreign tax credits ("ftcs") and the appropriateness for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. we consider factors such as: our three year cumulative pre-tax book income, the reversal of taxable timing differences, expectations regarding the occurrence of u.s. source income versus foreign source income within the ftcs carryforward period and tax planning strategies. historically, we have recorded a partial valuation allowance on ftcs. based on the expectations for these factors in the next year, we may determine that the deferred tax asset is not recoverable and an additional valuation allowance is necessary. this determination would have a significant impact on the effective tax rate.
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate. we assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes. the accounting standards prescribe a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
uncertain tax position accounting standards apply to all tax positions related to income taxes. these accounting standards utilize a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement.
62
as applicable, we recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
recently issued accounting standards see related disclosure at item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data", note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies."

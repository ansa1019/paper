item 1a.     risk factors our business involves various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those discussed in this section.  the risks and uncertainties described in the risk factors below, or any additional risk outside of those discussed below, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, or liquidity if they were to develop into actual events.  this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in other reports and materials we file periodically with the securities and exchange commissions.
risk factors related to the indemnity shareholder interest if the management fee rate paid to indemnity by the exchange is reduced or if there is a significant decrease in the amount of premiums written or assumed by the exchange, indemnity revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.
indemnity is dependent upon management fees paid by the exchange, which represent its principal source of revenue.  pursuant to the subscriber's agreements with the policyholders at the exchange, indemnity may retain up to 25% of all premiums written or assumed by the exchange.  therefore, management fee revenue from the exchange is calculated by multiplying the management fee rate by the direct premiums written by the exchange and the other members of the property and casualty group, which are assumed by the exchange under an intercompany pooling arrangement.  accordingly, any reduction in direct premiums written by the property and casualty group would have a negative effect on indemnity's revenues and net income.  see "risk factors related to the non-controlling interest owned by the exchange", which includes our property and casualty group and efl insurance operations, within this section for a discussion of risks impacting direct written premium.
the management fee rate is determined by our board of directors and may not exceed 25% of the premiums written or assumed by the exchange.  the board of directors sets the management fee rate each december for the following year.  at their discretion, the rate can be changed at any time.  the factors considered by the board of directors in setting the management fee rate include indemnity's financial position in relation to the exchange and the long-term needs of the exchange for capital and surplus to support its continued growth and competitiveness.  if the exchange's surplus were significantly reduced, the management fee rate could be reduced and indemnity's revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.
if the costs of providing services to the exchange are not controlled, indemnity's profitability could be materially adversely affected.
pursuant to the subscriber's agreements with the policyholders at the exchange, indemnity is appointed to perform certain services.  these services relate to the sales, underwriting, and issuance of policies on behalf of the exchange.  indemnity incurs significant costs related to commissions, employees, and technology in order to provide these services.
commissions to independent agents are the largest component of indemnity's cost of operations.  commissions include scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as additional commissions and bonuses to agents, which are earned by achieving certain targeted measures.  changes to commission rates or bonus programs may result in increased future costs and lower profitability.
employees are an essential part of the operating costs related to providing services for the exchange.  as a result, indemnity's profitability is affected by employee costs, including salaries, healthcare, pension, and other benefit costs.  recent regulatory developments, provider relationships, and economic factors that are beyond our control indicate that employee healthcare costs will continue to increase.  although indemnity actively manages these cost increases, there can be no assurance that future cost increases will not occur and reduce its profitability.
technological development is necessary to facilitate ease of doing business for the agents and policyholders of the property and casualty group and employees of indemnity. if we are unable to keep pace with advancements in technology, our ability to compete with other insurance companies may be negatively affected and result in lower revenues and reduced profitability for indemnity. in order to achieve a greater ease of doing business, additional costs may be incurred as we invest in new technology and systems, which may negatively impact the profitability of indemnity.
our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented executives, key managers, and employees is critical to our success.
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key management.  the loss of the services and leadership of certain key officers and the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers
9
could prevent us from successfully communicating, implementing, and executing business strategies, and therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
our success also depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain a talented employee base.  the inability to staff all functions of our business with employees possessing the appropriate technical expertise could have an adverse effect on our business performance.  staffing appropriately skilled employees for the handling of claims and servicing of customers, rendering of disciplined underwriting, and effective sales and marketing are critical to the core functions of our business. in addition, skilled employees in the actuarial, finance, and information technology areas are also essential to support our core functions.
if we are unable to ensure system availability, unable to secure sensitive information, or we make significant decisions based on inaccurate data, the erie insurance group may experience adverse financial consequences and/or may be unable to compete effectively in the industry. our business depends on the uninterrupted operations of our facilities, systems, and business functions.
indemnity is responsible for providing the technological resources necessary to support the operations of the erie insurance group.  our business is highly dependent upon the effective operations of our technology and information systems. we also conduct business functions and computer operations using the systems of third-party vendors, which may provide software, data storage, and other computer services to us. we rely upon our systems, and those of third-party vendors, to assist in key functions of core business operations including processing claims, applications, and premium payments, providing customer support, performing actuarial and financial analysis, and maintaining key data.
we necessarily collect, use, and hold data concerning individuals, businesses, strategic plans, and intellectual property. threats to data security, including unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, and other computer related penetrations, expose us to additional costs for protection or remediation to secure our data in accordance with customer expectations and statutory and regulatory requirements, including data privacy laws. preventative actions we take, or our third-party vendors take, to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins or other security breaches to our computer system. additionally, a breach of security that results in unauthorized access to our data could expose us to an operational disruption, data loss, litigation, fines and penalties, increased compliance costs, and reputational damages. while we maintain cyber liability insurance to mitigate the amount of financial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to protect against all loss.
we depend on a large amount of data to price policies appropriately, track exposures, perform financial analysis, and ultimately make business decisions. should this data be inaccurate or insufficient, risk exposure may be underestimated and/or poor business decisions may be made. this may in turn lead to adverse operational or financial performance.
we have an established business continuity plan to ensure the continuation of core business operations in the event that normal business operations could not be performed due to a catastrophic event. while we continue to test and assess our business continuity plan to ensure it meets the needs of our core business operations and addresses multiple business interruption events, there is no assurance that core business operations could be performed upon the occurrence of such an event.  systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform our business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. our business continuity is also dependent on third-party systems on which our information technology systems interface and rely.  our systems and those of our third-party vendors may become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as from catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, network failures, and viruses. the failure of our information systems for any reason could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
the performance of indemnity's investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition.
indemnity's investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixed-income maturities and limited partnerships.  at december 31, 2014, indemnity's investment portfolio consisted of approximately 80% fixed income securities, 16% limited partnerships, and 4% equity securities.
all of indemnity's marketable securities are subject to market volatility.  to the extent that future market volatility negatively impacts indemnity's investments, its financial condition will be negatively impacted. we review the investment portfolio on a continuous basis to evaluate positions that might have incurred other-than-temporary declines in value. inherent in management's evaluation of a security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. the primary factors considered in our review of investment valuation include the extent and duration to which fair
10
value is less than cost, historical operating performance and financial condition of the issuer, short- and long-term prospects of the issuer and its industry, specific events that occurred affecting the issuer, including rating downgrades, and, depending on the type of security, our intent to sell or our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value.  as the process for determining impairments is highly subjective, changes in our assessments may have a material effect on indemnity's operating results and financial condition. see also item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk".
if the fixed income, equity, or limited partnership portfolios were to suffer a substantial decrease in value, indemnity's financial position could be materially adversely affected through increased unrealized losses or impairments.
currently, 41% of the fixed-income portfolio is invested in municipal securities.  the performance of the fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks including, but not limited to:
•   interest rate risk - the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates. a sustained low interest rate environment would pressure our net investment income.
•   investment credit risk - the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease due to the deterioration in financial condition of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of asset-backed securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities, which, in each case, also includes the risk of permanent loss.
•   sector/concentration risk - the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries. events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, group of related industries, or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on our investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated within those issuers, sectors, or industries.
•   liquidity risk - the risk that indemnity will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis, or that indemnity will not be able to sell them at all, when desired. disruptions in the financial markets or a lack of buyers for the specific securities that indemnity is trying to sell, could prevent it from liquidating securities or cause a reduction in prices to levels that are not acceptable to indemnity.
general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our equity investments and the realization of net investment income, or result in realized investment losses. in addition, downward economic trends also may have an adverse effect on our investment results by negatively impacting the business conditions and impairing credit for the issuers of securities held in their respective investment portfolios.  this could reduce fair values of investments and generate significant unrealized losses or impairment charges which may adversely affect our financial results.
in addition to the fixed-income securities, a significant portion of indemnity's portfolio is invested in limited partnerships.  at december 31, 2014, indemnity had investments in limited partnerships of $113 million, or 9% of total assets.  in addition, indemnity is obligated to invest up to an additional $24 million in limited partnerships, including private equity, mezzanine debt, and real estate partnership investments.  limited partnerships are significantly less liquid and generally involve higher degrees of price risk, the risk of potential loss in estimated fair value resulting from an adverse change in prices, than publicly traded securities.  limited partnerships, like publicly traded securities, have exposure to market volatility; but unlike fixed-income securities, cash flows and return expectations are less predictable.  in addition, a portion of indemnity's limited partnership portfolio is invested in partnerships denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, and therefore exposed to foreign exchange rate risk. indemnity does not hedge its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk inherent in these investments.
the primary basis for the valuation of limited partnership interests are financial statements prepared by the general partner.  because of the timing of the preparation and delivery of these financial statements, the use of the most recently available financial statements provided by the general partners result in a quarter delay in the inclusion of the limited partnership results in our consolidated statements of operations.  due to this delay, indemnity's financial statements at december 31, 2014, do not reflect market conditions experienced in the fourth quarter of 2014.
indemnity's equity securities have exposure to price risk.  indemnity does not hedge its exposure to equity price risk inherent in its equity investments.  equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may also be subject to some of the same risks that affect indemnity's fixed-income portfolio, as discussed above.
11
indemnity is subject to credit risk from the exchange because the management fees from the exchange are not paid immediately when premiums are written.
indemnity recognizes management fees due from the exchange as income when the premiums are written because at that time indemnity has performed substantially all of the services it is required to perform, including sales, underwriting, and policy issuance activities.  however, such fees are not paid to indemnity by the exchange until the exchange collects the premiums from policyholders.  as a result, indemnity holds receivables for management fees since such fees are based upon premiums that have been written and assumed.  indemnity also holds receivables from the exchange for costs it pays on the exchange's behalf.  the receivable from the exchange totaled $335 million or 25% of our total assets at december 31, 2014.
deteriorating capital and credit market conditions or a failure to accurately estimate capital needs may significantly affect indemnity's ability to meet liquidity needs and access capital.
sufficient liquidity and capital levels are required to pay operating expenses, income taxes, and to provide the necessary resources to fund future growth opportunities, pay dividends on common stock, and repurchase common stock.  management estimates the appropriate level of capital necessary based upon current and projected results, which include a loading for potential risks.  failure to accurately estimate indemnity's capital needs may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition until additional sources of capital can be located.  further, a deteriorating financial condition may create a negative perception of indemnity by third parties, including rating agencies, investors, agents, and customers which could impact indemnity's ability to access additional capital in the debt or equity markets.
the primary sources of liquidity for indemnity are management fees and cash flows generated from its investment portfolio.  in the event indemnity's current sources do not satisfy its liquidity needs, indemnity has the ability to access its $100 million bank revolving line of credit, from which there were no borrowings as of december 31, 2014, or sell assets in its investment portfolio.  volatility in the financial markets could impair indemnity's ability to sell certain of its fixed income securities or, to a greater extent, it's significantly less liquid limited partnership investments, or cause such investments to sell at deep discounts.
in the event these traditional sources of liquidity are not available, indemnity may have to seek additional financing.  indemnity's access to funds will depend upon a number of factors including current market conditions, the availability of credit, market liquidity, and credit ratings.  in deteriorating market conditions, there can be no assurance that indemnity will obtain additional financing, or, if available, that the cost of financing will not substantially increase and affect our overall profitability.
indemnity is subject to applicable insurance laws, tax statutes, and regulations, as well as claims and legal proceedings, which, if determined unfavorably, could have a material adverse effect on indemnity's business, results of operations, or financial condition.
indemnity faces a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating its businesses including the risk of class action lawsuits. indemnity's pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to indemnity and others generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which it operates. in indemnity's operations, we are, have been, or may become subject to class actions and individual suits alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or underwriting practices, payment of contingent or other sales commissions, product design, product disclosure, policy issuance and administration, additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis, charging excessive or impermissible fees on products, recommending unsuitable products to customers, and breaching alleged fiduciary or other duties (including our obligations to indemnify directors and officers in connection with certain legal matters). indemnity is also subject to litigation arising out of its general business activities such as its contractual and employment relationships. plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against indemnity may seek very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. indemnity is also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas, and books and record examinations from state and federal regulators and authorities. changes in the way regulators administer those laws, tax statutes, or regulations could adversely impact indemnity's business, results of operations, or financial condition. see "risk factors related to the non-controlling interest owned by the exchange, which includes the property and casualty group and efl," that follows for additional discussion of litigation risks.
12
risk factors related to the noncontrolling interest owned by the exchange, which includes the property and casualty group and efl deteriorating general economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including declining consumer confidence, inflation, high unemployment, and the threat of recession, among others, may lead the property and casualty group's customers to modify coverage, not renew policies, or even cancel policies, which could adversely affect the premium revenue of the property and casualty group, and consequently indemnity's management fee.  these conditions could also impair the ability of customers to pay premiums when due, and as a result, the property and casualty group's bad debt write-offs could increase.
the property and casualty group depends on independent insurance agents, which exposes the property and casualty group to risks not applicable to companies with exclusive agents or other forms of distribution.
the property and casualty group markets and sells its insurance products through independent, non-exclusive insurance agencies.  these agencies are not obligated to sell only the property and casualty group's insurance products, and generally also sell competitors' insurance products.  we must offer insurance products that meet the needs of these agencies and their clients and maintain good relationships with these agencies.  the results of operations and business of the property and casualty group could be adversely affected by the following:
•   agencies' marketing efforts not being maintained at their current levels or agencies binding the property and casualty group to unacceptable insurance risks, failing to comply with established underwriting guidelines, or otherwise improperly marketing the property and casualty group's products.
•   agencies placing business with competing insurers due to compensation arrangements, real or perceived product or price differences, ease of doing business, including the perception that our technology solutions do not match their needs, perceived delivery of customer service, or other reasons.
•   if the property and casualty group is unsuccessful in maintaining and/or increasing the number of agencies in its independent agent distribution system.
•   computer systems of our independent agencies experiencing cyber-attacks and other security breaches, loss or corruption of information, or systems failures or outages.
•   consumer preferences, especially in personal lines insurance products, causing the insurance industry to migrate to a delivery system other than independent agencies.
our ability to maintain our reputation is a key factor to the property and casualty group's success.
the property and casualty group maintains a brand recognized for customer service.  the perceived performance, actions, and behaviors of employees, independent insurance agency representatives, and third party service partners may result in reputational harm to the property and casualty group's brand and the potential for a reduction in business. specific incidents which may cause harm include but are not limited to disputes, long customer wait times, errors in processing a claim, failure to protect sensitive customer data, and inappropriate social media communications. the degree of control we have over these events varies based upon the event type and who is responsible for causing the incident. if an extreme catastrophic event were to occur in a heavily concentrated area of policyholders, an extraordinarily high number of claims could have the potential to strain claims processing and affect our ability to satisfy our customers.  while we maintain and execute processes to minimize these events, we cannot completely eliminate this risk.
if our third party service providers fail to perform as anticipated, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs, reputational damage and a loss of business that may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
the property and casualty group faces significant competition from other regional and national insurance companies.  failure to keep pace with competitors may result in lower market share and revenues, which may have a material adverse effect on the property and casualty group's financial condition.
the property and casualty group competes with regional and national property and casualty insurers including direct writers of insurance coverage. many of these competitors are larger and many have greater financial, technical, and operating resources.
if we are unable to perform at industry best practice levels in terms of quality, cost containment, and speed-to-market due to inferior operating resources and/or problems with external relationships, the property and casualty group's business
13
performance may suffer.  as the business environment changes, if we are unable to adapt timely to emerging industry changes, or if our people do not conform to the changes, the property and casualty group's business could be materially impacted.
the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive on the basis of product, price, and service.  if competitors offer property and casualty products with more coverage and/or better service or offer lower rates, and we are unable to implement product or service improvements quickly enough to keep pace, the property and casualty group's ability to grow and renew its business may be adversely impacted. in addition, due to our focus on the automobile and homeowners insurance markets, we may be more sensitive to trends that could affect auto and home insurance coverages and rates over time. for example, if economic conditions, demographic trends, changing driving patterns, advancements in vehicle or home technology or safety features, or other factors, were to result in decreased demand for auto or home insurance or decreased auto or home insurance rates for an extended period, the automobile and homeowners insurance markets as a whole could shrink and our ability to generate revenue growth could be significantly impacted.
insurance customers are increasingly expecting to perform service interactions digitally, including but not limited to shopping, paying bills, and reporting and monitoring claims. examples of digital channels used in these interactions include traditional websites, social media sites, and mobile device applications. we expect competitors to continue to grow these channels, particularly those with some form of direct to consumer sales distribution. failure to position our digital servicing and distribution technology effectively in light of these trends could inhibit the property and casualty group's ability to grow and maintain its customer base.
changes in applicable insurance laws, regulations, or changes in the way regulators administer those laws or regulations could adversely change the property and casualty group's operating environment and increase its exposure to loss or put it at a competitive disadvantage.
property and casualty insurers are subject to extensive supervision in the states in which they do business. this regulatory oversight includes, by way of example, matters relating to licensing examination, rate setting, market conduct, policy forms, limitations on the nature and amount of certain investments, claims practices, mandated participation in involuntary markets and guaranty funds, reserve adequacy, insurer solvency, restrictions on underwriting standards, accounting standards, and transactions between affiliates.  such regulation and supervision are primarily for the benefit and protection of policyholders and not for the benefit of shareholders.  for instance, members of the property and casualty group are subject to involuntary participation in specified markets in various states in which they operate, and the rate levels the property and casualty group is permitted to charge do not always correspond with the underlying costs associated with the coverage issued.  additionally, certain transactions and agreements between indemnity and the exchange must be approved by the appropriate state insurance department(s).  although currently the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry, federal programs, such as federal terrorism backstop legislation and the federal insurance office established under the dodd-frank act can also impact the insurance industry.  in addition to specific insurance regulation, the property and casualty group must also comply with other regulatory, legal, and ethical requirements relating to the general operation of a business.
premium rates and reserves must be established for members of the property and casualty group from forecasts of the ultimate costs expected to arise from risks underwritten during the policy period.  the property and casualty group's underwriting profitability could be adversely affected to the extent such premium rates or reserves are too low or by the effects of inflation.
one of the distinguishing features of the property and casualty insurance industry in general is that its products are priced before its costs are known, as premium rates are generally determined before losses are reported.  consequently, in establishing premium rates, we attempt to anticipate claims frequency and the potential impact of inflation, including medical cost inflation, construction and auto repair cost inflation and tort issues.  medical costs are a broad element of inflation that impact personal and commercial auto, general liability, workers compensation and commercial multi-peril lines of insurance written by the property and casualty group.  accordingly, premium rates must be established from forecasts of the ultimate costs expected to arise from risks underwritten during the policy period.  these premium rates may prove to be inadequate if future claims frequency and/or inflation are significantly higher than the estimates anticipated in pricing.
property and casualty insurers establish reserves for losses and loss expenses that will not be paid and settled for many years.  numerous factors affect both the current estimates and final settlement value of these losses and loss expenses.  it is possible that the ultimate liability for these losses and loss expenses will exceed these reserves because of unanticipated changes in the future development of known losses, the unanticipated emergence of losses that have occurred but are currently unreported, and larger than expected settlements on pending and unreported claims.  the process of estimating reserves is inherently judgmental and can be influenced by factors that are subject to variation.  if pricing or reserves of the property and casualty group are not sufficient, the property and casualty group's financial condition may be adversely impacted.
14
the property and casualty insurance industry has historically been cyclical with periods of intense price competition.  the property and casualty group seeks an appropriate balance between profitability and premium growth.  periods of intense price competition in the cycle could adversely affect the property and casualty group's financial condition, profitability, or cash flows.
emerging claims and coverage issues in the insurance industry are unpredictable and could cause an adverse effect on the property and casualty group's results of operations or financial condition.
as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge.  these issues may adversely affect the property and casualty group's business by either extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims.  in some instances, these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after the property and casualty group has issued the affected insurance policies.  as a result, the full extent of liability under the property and casualty group's insurance policies may not be known for many years after the policies are issued.
changes in reserve estimates may adversely affect efl's operating results.
reserves for life-contingent contract benefits are computed on the basis of long-term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, persistency, and expenses.  we periodically review the adequacy of these reserves on an aggregate basis and, if future experience differs significantly from assumptions, adjustments to reserves and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on efl's operating results.
the financial performance of members of the property and casualty group could be adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic losses, including terrorism. the financial performance of efl could be adversely affected by pandemic events.
the property and casualty group's insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. a single catastrophic occurrence or aggregation of multiple smaller occurrences could adversely affect the results of operations of members of the property and casualty group. common natural catastrophic events include hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, hail storms, and severe winter weather. the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposures in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. the frequency and severity of these catastrophes is inherently unpredictable. changing climate conditions have added to the unpredictability, frequency and severity of natural disasters and have created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. we cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions may have on our results of operations.
our ability to appropriately manage catastrophe risk depends partially on catastrophe models that are based on historical data, current risk exposure, damageability assumptions and meteorological assumption. the unpredictability of some of these inputs and the long-term impact of climate change create uncertainty in the frequency and severity of future events.
the property and casualty group maintains an excess property catastrophe reinsurance program which became effective january 1, 2015. the multi-layer program affords coverage up to a $1.1 billion catastrophe, providing a total of $682 million in coverage excess of the property and casualty group's per occurrence loss retention of $300 million. if a major catastrophic loss exceeds the reinsurance limit, this catastrophe reinsurance could be inadequate resulting in an adverse effect on the property and casualty group's underwriting profitability and financial position. there is also a risk that the reinsurance counterparties could default on their obligations.
terrorist attacks could also cause losses from insurance claims related to the property and casualty insurance operations. the federal terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act ("tria") of 2015 requires that some coverage for terrorist losses be offered by primary commercial property insurers and provides federal assistance for recovery of claims.  while the property and casualty group is exposed to terrorism losses in commercial lines and workers compensation, these lines are afforded a limited backstop above insurer deductibles for acts of terrorism under this federal program.  there is no federal assistance for personal lines terrorism losses. the property and casualty group could incur large net losses if terrorist attacks were to occur. the current federal tria expires at the end of 2020.
an epidemic or pandemic affecting one or more of the states in which efl conducts substantial business could adversely affect its financial and operational results, particularly if the event affected a broad range of the population.
15
the inability to acquire reinsurance coverage at reasonable rates or collect amounts due from reinsurers could have an adverse effect on the exchange.
the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, both in terms of price and available capacity.  the availability of reinsurance capacity can be impacted by general economic conditions and conditions in the reinsurance market, such as the occurrence of significant reinsured events.  the availability and cost of reinsurance could affect the property and casualty group's business volume and profitability.
although the reinsurer is liable to the property and casualty group to the extent of the ceded reinsurance, reinsurance contracts do not relieve the property and casualty group from its primary obligations to its policyholders.  as a result, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate the property and casualty group's obligation to pay claims.  the property and casualty group is subject to credit risk with respect to its ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.  the property and casualty group's inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have an adverse effect on its underwriting profitability and financial condition.
the performance of the exchange's investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition.
the exchange's investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixed-income maturities, common stocks, and limited partnerships.  at december 31, 2014, the exchange's investment portfolio consisted of approximately 65% fixed income securities, 24% common stocks, 6% limited partnerships, and 5% preferred equity securities.
all of the exchange's marketable securities are subject to market volatility.  to the extent that future market volatility negatively impacts these investments, the financial condition of the exchange will be negatively impacted. we review the investment portfolio on a continuous basis to evaluate positions that might have incurred other-than-temporary declines in value. inherent in management's evaluation of a security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. the primary factors considered in our review of investment valuation include the extent and duration to which fair value is less than cost, historical operating performance and financial condition of the issuer, short- and long-term prospects of the issuer and its industry, specific events that occurred affecting the issuer including rating downgrades, and, depending on the type of security, our intent to sell or our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value.  as the process for determining impairments is highly subjective, changes in our assessments may have a material effect on the exchange's operating results and financial condition.  see also item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk".
if the fixed-income, equity, or limited partnership portfolios were to suffer a substantial decrease in value, the exchange's financial position could be materially adversely affected through increased unrealized losses or impairments.  a significant decrease in the exchange's portfolio could also put it, or its subsidiaries, at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory or rating agency minimum capital requirements.
the exchange's fixed-income portfolio is invested in 34% in financial sector securities and 16% in municipal securities. these results may vary depending on the market environment.  the performance of the fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks including, but not limited to:
•   interest rate risk - the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates. a sustained low interest rate environment would pressure our net investment income.
•   investment credit risk - the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease due to the deterioration in financial condition of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of asset-backed securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities, which, in each case, also includes the risk of permanent loss.
•   sector/concentration risk - the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries. events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on our investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated within those issuers, sectors, or industries.
•   liquidity risk - the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis, or that the we will not be able to sell them at all, when desired. disruptions in the financial markets, or a lack of buyers for the specific securities that we are trying to sell, could prevent it from liquidating securities or cause a reduction in prices to levels that are not acceptable to us.
16
the exchange's common and preferred equity securities have exposure to price risk, the risk of potential loss in estimated fair value resulting from an adverse change in prices.  in addition, a portion of the exchange's common stock portfolio is invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. these investments also have exposure to foreign exchange rate risk, or the potential loss in estimated fair value resulting from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. the exchange does not hedge its exposure to equity price risk or foreign exchange rate risk inherent in the equity investments.  the exchange's common and preferred equity securities may also be subject to some of the same risks that affect the exchange's fixed-income portfolio, as discussed above. general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our equity investments and the realization of net investment income, or result in realized investment losses. in addition, downward economic trends also may have an adverse effect on our investment results by negatively impacting the business conditions and impairing credit for the issuers of securities held in their respective investment portfolios.  this could reduce fair values of investments and generate significant unrealized losses or impairment charges which may adversely affect our financial results.
a portion of the portfolio is invested in limited partnerships, including private equity, mezzanine debt, and real estate partnership investments.  at december 31, 2014, the exchange had investments in limited partnerships of $866 million, or
5% of total assets, with an obligation to invest up to an additional $459 million. limited partnerships are significantly less liquid and generally involve higher degrees of price risk than publicly traded securities.  limited partnerships, like publicly traded securities, have exposure to market volatility; but unlike fixed income securities, cash flows and return expectations are less predictable.  in addition, a portion of the exchange's limited partnership portfolio is invested in partnerships denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, and therefore exposed to foreign exchange rate risk. the exchange does not hedge its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk inherent in these investments.
the primary basis for the valuation of limited partnership interests are financial statements prepared by the general partner.  because of the timing of the preparation and delivery of these financial statements, the use of the most recently available financial statements provided by the general partners result in a quarter delay in the inclusion of the limited partnership results in our consolidated statements of operations.  due to this delay, the exchange's financial statements at december 31, 2014 do not reflect market conditions experienced in the fourth quarter of 2014.
deteriorating capital and credit market conditions or a failure to accurately estimate capital needs may significantly affect the exchange's ability to meet liquidity needs and access capital.
sufficient liquidity and capital levels are required to pay claims, claims-related expenses, and income taxes as well as to build the exchange's investment portfolio, provide for additional protection against possible large, unexpected losses, and maintain adequate surplus amounts.  management estimates the appropriate level of capital necessary based upon current and projected results, which include a loading for potential risks. failure to accurately estimate the exchange's capital needs may have a material adverse effect on the exchange's financial condition until additional sources of capital can be located.  further, a deteriorating financial condition may create a negative perception of the exchange by third parties, including rating agencies, investors, agents, and customers which could impact the exchange's ability to access additional capital in the debt or equity markets.
the primary sources of liquidity for the exchange are insurance premiums and cash flow generated from its investment portfolio.  in the event the exchange's current sources do not satisfy its liquidity needs, the exchange has the ability to access its $300 million bank revolving line of credit, from which there were no borrowings as of december 31, 2014, or sell assets in its investment portfolios. volatility in the financial markets could impair the exchange's ability to sell certain fixed income securities or, to a greater extent, our significantly less liquid limited partnership investments, or cause such investments to sell at deep discounts. in the event these traditional sources of liquidity are not available, the exchange may have to seek additional financing.  the exchange's access to funds will depend upon a number of factors including current market conditions, the availability of credit, market liquidity, and credit ratings.  in deteriorating market conditions, there can be no assurance that the exchange will obtain additional financing, or, if available, that the cost of financing will not substantially increase and affect our overall profitability.
if there were a failure to maintain commercially acceptable financial strength ratings, the exchange's competitive position in the insurance industry would be adversely affected.
financial strength ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. higher ratings generally indicate greater financial stability and a stronger ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders.  ratings are assigned by rating agencies to insurers based upon factors that the rating agencies believe are relevant to policyholders.  the property and casualty group's pooled a.m. best rating is currently a+ ("superior"). efl's a.m. best rating is currently a ("excellent").  rating agencies periodically review insurers' ratings and change their ratings criteria; therefore, our current ratings may not be maintained in the future. a significant downgrade in this or other ratings would reduce the competitive
17
position of the property and casualty group and efl, making it more difficult to attract profitable business in the highly competitive property and casualty insurance market resulting in reduced sales of our products.
the property and casualty group is subject to claims and legal proceedings, which, if determined unfavorably to the property and casualty group, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
the property and casualty group faces a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating its businesses including the risk of class action lawsuits.  the property and casualty group's pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to the property and casualty group and others generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which it operates.  in the property and casualty group's insurance operations, we are, have been, or may become subject to class actions and individual suits alleging, among other things, issues relating to claims payments and procedures, denial or delay of benefits, charging excessive or impermissible fees on products, and breaching fiduciary or other duties to customers.  the property and casualty group is also subject to litigation arising out of its general business activities such as its contractual relationships. plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against the property and casualty group may seek very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time.  the property and casualty group is also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas, and books and record examinations from state and federal regulators and authorities.  see "risk factors related to the indemnity shareholder interest," within this section for additional discussion of litigation risks.
the exchange is dependent upon indemnity to perform certain services, including sales, underwriting, and the issuance of policies and the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems and business functions.  failure to perform these services effectively may have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the exchange.
pursuant to the attorney-in-fact agreements with the policyholders at the exchange, indemnity is responsible for performing key functions for the exchange including management and operational services, including the technology and systems to perform business functions.  the board of directors of indemnity has the responsibility for exchange-related activities such as setting the management fee paid by the exchange to indemnity. the business and financial condition of the exchange would be materially adversely affected if indemnity was not able to provide the necessary operating and management services required by the exchange.
an inability to access our facilities, or a failure of technology or other systems could significantly impair the ability to perform business functions in a timely and effective manner. if our business continuity plan does not sufficiently consider and address the circumstances of an interruption, including without limitation natural events, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics, computer security breaches or cyber-attacks, or interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of third-party vendors, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely effected.

operating overview overview the erie insurance group represents the consolidated results of indemnity and the results of its variable interest entity, the exchange.  the erie insurance group operates predominantly as a property and casualty insurer through its regional insurance carriers that write a broad range of personal and commercial coverages.  our property and casualty insurance companies include the exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries, erie insurance company ("eic"), erie insurance company of new york ("eny"), erie insurance property and casualty company ("epc") and flagship city insurance company ("flagship").  these entities operate collectively as the "property and casualty group."  the erie insurance group also operates as a life insurer through the exchange's wholly owned subsidiary, erie family life insurance company ("efl"), which underwrites and sells individual and group life insurance policies and fixed annuities.
the exchange is a reciprocal insurance exchange organized under article x of pennsylvania's insurance company law of 1921 under which individuals, partnerships, and corporations are authorized to exchange reciprocal or inter-insurance contracts with each other, or with individuals, partnerships, and corporations of other states and countries, providing indemnity among themselves from any loss which may be insured against under any provision of the insurance laws except life insurance.  each applicant for insurance to the exchange signs a subscriber's agreement, which contains an appointment of indemnity as their attorney-in-fact to transact the business of the exchange on their behalf.
pursuant to the subscriber's agreement and for its services as attorney-in-fact, indemnity earns a management fee calculated as a percentage of the direct premiums written by the exchange and the other members of the property and casualty group, which are assumed by the exchange under an intercompany pooling arrangement.
the indemnity shareholder interest includes indemnity's equity and income, but not the equity or income of the exchange.  the exchange's equity, which is comprised of its retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income, is held for the interest of its subscribers (policyholders) and meets the definition of a noncontrolling interest, which is reflected as such in our consolidated financial statements.
"indemnity shareholder interest" refers to the interest in erie indemnity company owned by the class a and class b shareholders.  "noncontrolling interest" refers to the interest in the erie insurance exchange held for the interest of the subscribers (policyholders).
the indemnity shareholder interest in income comprises:
•   a management fee of up to 25% of all property and casualty insurance premiums written or assumed by the exchange, less the costs associated with the sales, underwriting, and issuance of these policies;
•   net investment income and results on investments that belong to indemnity; and
•   other income and expenses, including income taxes, that are the responsibility of indemnity.
the exchange's or the noncontrolling interest in income comprises:
•   a 100% interest in the net underwriting results of the property and casualty insurance operations;
•   a 100% interest in the net earnings of efl's life insurance operations;
•   net investment income and results on investments that belong to the exchange and its subsidiaries; and
•   other income and expenses, including income taxes, that are the responsibility of the exchange and its subsidiaries.

results of the erie insurance group's operations by interest the following table represents a breakdown of the composition of the income attributable to the indemnity shareholder interest and the income attributable to the noncontrolling interest (exchange).  for purposes of this discussion, efl's investments are included in the life insurance operations.

(1)   earnings on life insurance related invested assets are integral to the evaluation of the life insurance operations because of the long duration of life products. on that basis, for presentation purposes, the life insurance operations in the table above include life insurance related investment results. however, the life insurance investment results are included in the investment operations segment discussion as part of the exchange's investment results.
net income decreased in 2014 when compared to 2013 due to an underwriting loss experienced in the property and casualty insurance operations in 2014 compared to an underwriting gain in 2013 and lower levels of income from our investment operations. the underwriting results in the property and casualty insurance operations were negatively impacted by an increase in current accident year losses and catastrophe losses compared to 2013, offset somewhat by favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves. our income from investment operations recorded lower levels of net realized gains on investments and earnings from limited partnerships in 2014 compared to 2013 offset somewhat by higher levels of net investment income.
net income increased in 2013 when compared to 2012 due to an underwriting gain experienced in the property and casualty insurance operations in 2013 compared to an underwriting loss in 2012 and increased income from our investment operations. the 2013 underwriting results in the property and casualty insurance operations were positively impacted by lower levels of catastrophe losses compared to 2012, offset somewhat by lower levels of favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves in 2013 compared to 2012. our income from investment operations improved in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to an increase in net realized gains on investments.
the exchange's property and casualty insurance operations experienced a 8.6% and 9.6% increase in direct written premium in 2014 and 2013, respectively, driven by increases in policies in force and the average premium per policy, which also positively impacted indemnity's management fee revenue.

reconciliation of operating income to net income we disclose operating income, a non-gaap financial measure, to enhance our investors' understanding of our performance related to the indemnity shareholder interest.  our method of calculating this measure may differ from those used by other companies, and therefore comparability may be limited.
indemnity defines operating income as net income excluding realized capital gains and losses, impairment losses, and related federal income taxes.
indemnity uses operating income to evaluate the results of its operations.  it reveals trends that may be obscured by the net effects of realized capital gains and losses including impairment losses.  realized capital gains and losses, including impairment losses, may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and economic developments such as capital market conditions which are not related to our ongoing operations.  we are aware that the price to earnings multiple commonly used by investors as a forward-looking valuation technique uses operating income as the denominator.  operating income should not be considered as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") and does not reflect indemnity's overall profitability.
the following table reconciles operating income and net income for the indemnity shareholder interest for the years ended december 31:

operating segments our reportable segments include management operations, property and casualty insurance operations, life insurance operations, and investment operations.
management operations management operations generate internal management fee revenue, which accrues to the indemnity shareholder interest, as indemnity provides services relating to the sales, underwriting, and issuance of policies on behalf of the exchange.  management fee revenue is based upon all premiums written or assumed by the exchange and the management fee rate, which is not to exceed 25%.  our board of directors establishes the management fee rate at least annually, generally in december for the following year, and considers factors such as the relative financial strength of indemnity and the exchange and projected revenue streams.  the management fee rate was set at 25% for 2014, 2013 and 2012.  our board of directors set the 2015 management fee rate again at 25%, its maximum level.  management fee revenue is eliminated upon consolidation.
property and casualty insurance operations the property and casualty insurance business is driven by premium growth, the combined ratio, and investment returns.  the property and casualty insurance industry is cyclical, with periods of rising premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of substantial price competition and excess capacity.  the cyclical nature of the insurance industry has a direct impact on the direct written premium of the property and casualty group.
the property and casualty insurance operation's premium growth strategy focuses on growth by expansion of existing operations including a careful agency selection process and increased market penetration in existing operating territories.  expanding the size of our existing agency force of nearly 2,200 independent agencies, with over 11,000 licensed property and casualty representatives, will contribute to future growth as new agents build their books of business with the property and casualty group.
geographic expansion is also a component of the property and casualty group's premium growth strategy. the property and casualty group began writing private passenger automobile, home insurance, and personal excess liability insurance in kentucky in the fourth quarter of 2014.
the property and casualty insurance operations insure preferred and standard risks while maintaining a disciplined underwriting approach.  the property and casualty group's principal personal lines products based upon 2014 direct written premiums were private passenger automobile (43%) and homeowners (27%), and the principal commercial lines products were commercial multi-peril (13%), commercial automobile (7%), and workers compensation (7%).  pennsylvania, maryland, virginia, north carolina and ohio made up 74% of the property and casualty lines insurance business direct written premium in 2014.
members of the property and casualty group pool the underwriting results under an intercompany pooling agreement.  under the pooling agreement, the exchange retains a 94.5% interest in the net underwriting results of the property and casualty group, while eic retains a 5.0% interest, and eny retains a 0.5% interest.
the key measure of underwriting profitability traditionally used in the property and casualty insurance industry is the combined ratio, which is expressed as a percentage.  it is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses to premiums earned (expense ratio).  when the combined ratio is less than 100%, underwriting results are generally considered profitable; when the combined ratio is greater than 100%, underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable.
factors affecting losses and loss expenses include the frequency and severity of losses, the nature and severity of catastrophic losses, the quality of risks underwritten, and underlying claims and settlement expenses.
investments held by the property and casualty group are reported in the investment operations segment, separate from the underwriting business.
life insurance operations efl generates revenues through the sale of its individual and group life insurance policies and fixed annuities.  these products provide our property and casualty agency force an opportunity to cross-sell both personal and commercial accounts.  efl's profitability depends principally on the ability to develop, price, and distribute insurance products, attract and retain deposit funds, generate investment returns, and manage expenses.  other drivers include mortality and morbidity experience, persistency experience to enable the recovery of acquisition costs, maintenance of interest spreads over the amounts credited to deposit funds, and the maintenance of strong ratings from rating agencies. efl began writing life insurance and annuity products in kentucky in the fourth quarter of 2014.

earnings on life insurance related invested assets are integral to the evaluation of the life insurance operations because of the long duration of life products.  on that basis, for presentation purposes, the life insurance operations segment discussion includes the life insurance related investment results.  however, also for presentation purposes, the segment footnote and the investment operations segment discussion include the life insurance investment results as part of the exchange's investment results.
investment operations we generate revenues from our fixed maturity, equity security, and limited partnership investment portfolios to support our underwriting business.  the indemnity and exchange portfolios are managed with the objective of maximizing after-tax returns on a risk-adjusted basis, while the efl portfolio is managed to be closely aligned to its liabilities and to maintain a sufficient yield to meet profitability targets.  we actively evaluate the portfolios for impairments, and record impairment writedowns on investments in instances where the fair value of the investment is substantially below cost, and it is concluded that the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, which includes consideration for intent to sell.
general conditions and trends affecting our business economic conditions unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including declining consumer confidence, inflation, high unemployment, and the threat of recession, among others, may lead the property and casualty group's customers to modify coverage, not renew policies, or even cancel policies, which could adversely affect the premium revenue of the property and casualty group, and consequently indemnity's management fee.  these conditions could also impair the ability of customers to pay premiums when due, and as a result, the property and casualty group's bad debt write-offs could increase.  further, unanticipated increased inflation costs including medical cost inflation, construction and auto repair cost inflation, and tort issues may impact the estimated loss reserves and future premium rates. our key challenge is to generate profitable revenue growth in a highly competitive market that continues to experience the effects of uncertain economic conditions.
financial market volatility our portfolio of fixed income, preferred and common stocks, and limited partnerships are subject to market volatility especially in periods of instability in the worldwide financial markets.  over time, net investment income could also be impacted by volatility and by the general level of interest rates, which impact reinvested cash flow from the portfolio and business operations. depending upon market conditions, which are unpredictable and remain uncertain, considerable fluctuation could exist in the fair value of our investment portfolio and reported total investment income, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
30
critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements include amounts based upon estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures.  we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and 2) different estimates that could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are likely to occur from period-to-period, could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or financial position.
the following presents a discussion of those accounting policies surrounding estimates that we believe are the most critical to our reported amounts and require the most subjective and complex judgment.  if actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions, there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.  the estimates and the estimating methods used are reviewed continually, and any adjustments considered necessary are reflected in current earnings.
property and casualty insurance loss and loss expense reserves property and casualty insurance loss and loss expense reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by us.  these reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported (case) and those that have been incurred but not reported (ibnr) and include estimates of all future payments associated with processing and settling these claims.
the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and involves a variety of actuarial techniques.  the loss reserve estimation process is based largely on the assumption that past development trends are an appropriate indicator of future events.  reserve estimates are based upon our assessment of known facts and circumstances, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims frequency and severity, legal theories of liability and other factors.  variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by 1) internal factors, including changes in claims handling procedures and changes in the quality of risk selection in the underwriting process, and 2) external events, such as economic inflation and regulatory and legislative changes.  due to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used, final loss settlements may vary significantly from the current estimates, particularly when those settlements may not occur until well into the future.
how reserves are established case reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new information becomes known during the course of handling the claims.  ibnr reserves represent the difference between the case reserves for actual reported loss and loss expenses and the estimated ultimate cost of all claims.
our loss and loss expense reserves include amounts related to short-tail and long-tail lines of business.  tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the final settlement of the claim.  the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim, the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary.  most of our loss and loss expense reserves relate to long-tail liability lines of business including workers compensation, bodily injury and other liability coverages, such as commercial liability.  short-tail lines of business, which represent a smaller percentage of our loss reserves, include personal auto physical damage and personal property.
our actuaries review all direct reserve estimates on a quarterly basis for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data.  reserves for massive injury lifetime medical claims, including auto no-fault and workers compensation claims, are reviewed at a more detailed level semi-annually.  these massive injury claim reserves are relatively few in number and are very long-tail liabilities.  in intervening quarters, development on massive injury reserves is monitored to confirm that the estimate of ultimate losses should not change.  if an unusual development is observed, a detailed review is conducted to determine whether the reserve estimate should change.  significant changes to the factors discussed above, which are either known or reasonably projected through analysis of internal and external data, are quantified in the reserve estimates each quarter.
our actuaries review assumed reserve estimates annually for both current and prior accident years. the property and casualty group ceased writing voluntary assumed business in 2003. outstanding liabilities for the voluntary and involuntary assumed business are immaterial compared to the overall reserves. our ceded reserves primarily relate to massive injury lifetime medical claims; the ceded estimates for these claims are adjusted when there is a change to the direct reserve estimate. the remainder of the ceded reserves is reviewed by our actuaries annually.
the quarterly reserve reviews incorporate a variety of actuarial methods and judgments and involve rigorous analysis.  a comprehensive review is performed of the various estimation methods and reserve levels produced by each.  the various
31
methods generate different estimates of ultimate losses by product line and product coverage combination.  thus, reserves are comprised of a set of point estimates of the ultimate losses developed from the various methods.  these multiple reserve point estimates are reviewed by our reserving actuaries and reserve best estimates are selected.  the selected reserve estimates are discussed with management.
numerous factors are considered in setting reserve levels, including, but not limited to, the assessed reliability of key loss trends and assumptions that may significantly influence the current actuarial indications, the maturity of the accident year, pertinent claims frequency and severity trends observed over recent years, the level of volatility within a particular line of business and the improvement or deterioration of actuarial rate indications in the current period as compared to prior periods.  certain methods are considered more credible for each product/coverage combination depending on the maturity of the accident quarter, the mix of business and the particular internal and external influences impacting the claims experience or the method.
the following is a discussion of the most common methods used:
paid development - paid loss development patterns are generated from historical data and applied to current paid losses to generate estimated ultimate losses.  paid development techniques do not use information about case reserves and therefore are not affected by changes in case reserving practices.  these techniques are generally most useful for short-tailed segments since a high percentage of ultimate losses are paid in early periods of development.
incurred development - incurred loss development patterns (reflecting cumulative paid losses plus current case reserves) are generated from historical data.  the patterns are applied to current incurred losses to generate estimated ultimate losses.  incurred methods and/or combinations of the paid and incurred methods are used in developing estimated ultimate losses for short-tail coverages and long-tail coverages, expected loss ratio - an expected loss ratio is developed through a review of historical loss ratios by accident quarter, adjusted for changes to earned premium, mix of business and other factors that are expected to impact the loss ratio for the accident quarter being evaluated. a preliminary estimate of ultimate losses is calculated by multiplying this expected loss ratio by earned premium.
bornhuetter-ferguson - bornhuetter-ferguson is a method of combining the results of the expected-loss-ratio method and the paid or incurred development method. it places more weight on the paid or incurred development method as the accident period matures. the bornhuetter-ferguson method is generally used for less mature accident periods on the long-tail coverages because a low percentage of losses are paid or incurred in the early period of development.
survival ratio - this method measures the ratio of the average loss and loss expense amount paid annually to the total reserve for the product line or product coverage.  the survival ratio represents the number of years of payments that the current level of reserves will cover.  the reserve is established so that a particular ratio, representing the time to closing of all claims, is achieved.  this method is also used as a reasonability check of reserve adequacy.
individual claim - this method estimates the ultimate losses on a claim-by-claim basis.  an annual payment assumption is made for each claimant and then projected into the future based upon a particular assumption of the future inflation rate and life expectancy of the claimant.  this method is used for unusual, large claims.
weather event paid and reported development - the historical patterns utilized in paid and reported development methods for weather events are derived from historical data for the same type of weather event.  initial weather event ultimate loss estimates are reviewed with claims management.
line of business methods for each product line and product/coverage combination, certain methods are given more influence than other methods.  the discussion below gives a general indication of which methods are preferred for each line of business.  as circumstances change, the methods that are given greater weight can change.
massive injury lifetime medical claims (such as certain auto no-fault and workers compensation claims) - these claims develop over a long period of time and are relatively few in number.  we utilize the individual claim method to evaluate each claim's ultimate losses.
personal auto physical damage and homeowners - these lines are fast-developing and we rely more on the paid and incurred development techniques.
32
personal auto liability (such as bodily injury and uninsured/underinsured motorist) - for auto liability, and bodily injury in particular, we review the results of a greater number of techniques than for physical damage.  we tend to rely on the bornhuetter-ferguson method for more recent experience periods and paid and incurred development methods for the older accident periods.
workers compensation and long-tailed liability (such as commercial liability) - we generally rely upon the expected loss ratio, bornhuetter-ferguson and incurred development techniques.  these techniques are generally weighted together, relying more heavily on the bornhuetter-ferguson method at early ages of development and more on the incurred development method as the accident periods mature.
the methods used for estimating loss expenses are as follows:
defense and cost containment expenses (d&cc) - d&cc is analyzed using paid development techniques and an analysis of the relationship between d&cc payments and loss payments.
adjusting and other expenses (a&o) - a&o reserves are projected based upon an expected cost per claim year, the anticipated claim closure pattern, and the ratio of paid a&o to paid loss.
key assumptions for loss reserving the accuracy of the various methods used to estimate reserves is a function of the degree to which underlying assumptions are satisfied.  the most significant key assumptions are:
development patterns - historical paid and incurred amounts contain patterns which indicate how unpaid and ibnr amounts will emerge in future periods.  unless reasons or factors are identified that invalidate the extension of historical patterns into the future, these patterns can be used to make projections necessary for estimating loss and loss adjustment expense reserves.  this is the most significant assumption and it applies to all methods.
impact of inflation - property and casualty insurance reserves are established before the extent to which inflation may impact such reserves is known.  consequently, in establishing reserves, we attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation, including medical cost inflation, construction and auto repair cost inflation and tort issues.  medical costs are a broad element of inflation that impacts personal and commercial auto, general liability, workers compensation and commercial multi-peril lines of insurance written by the property and casualty group.  inflation assumptions take the form of explicit numerical values in the survival ratio, individual claim, and massive injury lifetime medical reserving methods.  inflation assumptions are implicitly derived through the selection of applicable loss development patterns for all other reserving methods.
future cost increase assumptions are derived from a review of historical cost increases and are assumed to persist into the future.  future medical cost increases and claimant mortality assumptions utilized in the reserve estimates for massive injury lifetime medical claims are obtained from industry studies adjusted for our own experience.  reserve levels are sensitive to these assumptions because these amounts represent projections over 30 to 40 years into the future.
other internal and external factors occasionally, unusual aberrations in loss development patterns are caused by external and internal factors such as changes in claim reporting and/or settlement patterns, unusually large losses, process changes, legal or regulatory changes and other influences.  in these instances, analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses.
claims with atypical emergence patterns - characteristics of certain subsets of claims, such as those with high severity, have the potential to distort patterns contained in historical paid loss and reported loss data.  when testing indicates this to be the case for a particular subset of claims, our actuaries segregate these claims from the data and analyze them separately.
changes in loss ratio trends - prior loss ratio assumptions utilized in the bornhuetter-ferguson method are derived from projections of historical loss ratios based upon actual experience from more mature accident periods adjusted for assumed changes in average premiums, frequency and severity.  these assumptions influence only the most recent accident periods, but the majority of reserves originate with the most recent accident periods.  reserve levels are highly sensitive to these assumptions.
relationship of loss expense to losses - d&cc-to-loss ratio assumptions utilized in the bornhuetter-ferguson method are initially derived from historical relationships.  these historical ratios are adjusted according to the impact of changing internal and external factors.  the a&o-to-loss ratio assumption is similarly derived from historical relationships and adjusted as required for identified internal or external changes.

reserve discounting loss reserves are set at ultimate cost, except for workers compensation loss reserves, which are discounted on a nontabular basis using an interest rate of 2.5% and our historical workers compensation payout patterns. in our workers compensation discounting methodology, we segregate the workers compensation massive injury claims that have longer payout patterns from the non-massive injury workers compensation claims. the discount on workers compensation reserves was $89 million at december 31, 2014. a 100-basis point increase in the discount rate would result in an increase to the discount of $48 million at december 31, 2014.
reserve estimate variability the property and casualty reserves with the greatest potential for variation are the massive injury lifetime medical reserves. these claims arise from the automobile no-fault law in pennsylvania before 1986 and workers compensation policies which provide unlimited medical benefits. the estimate of ultimate liabilities for these claims is subject to significant judgment due to variations in claimant health, mortality over time and health care cost trends. these claims have been segregated from the total population of claims. ultimate losses for these claims are estimated on a claim-by-claim basis. we are currently reserving for 245 claimants requiring lifetime medical care, of which 97 involve massive injuries. the annual payment is projected into the future based upon particular assumptions of the future inflation rate and life expectancy of the claimant. the most significant variable in estimating this liability is medical cost inflation. the life expectancy (mortality rate) assumption underlying the estimate reflects the gender specific disabled pensioner mortality table. actual experience, however, may emerge in a manner that is different relative to the original assumptions, which could have a significant impact on our reserve estimates.
auto no-fault (massive injury lifetime medical claims) - the automobile massive injury gross reserve carried by the property and casualty group totaled $330 million at december 31, 2014, compared to $345 million at december 31, 2013. the slight decrease in the pre-1986 automobile massive injury reserves in 2014, compared to 2013, was due to continued payments on these claims. a 100-basis point increase in the medical cost inflation assumption would result in an increase in the property and casualty group's gross year-end reserve of $64 million. this increase in the medical cost inflation assumption would also increase the reinsurance recoverable related to these reserves by $25 million, resulting in a $39 million increase in the net reserve.
workers compensation (massive injury lifetime medical claims) - the workers compensation massive injury reserve carried by the property and casualty group totaled $82 million at december 31, 2014, compared to $94 million at december 31, 2013, net of discounting. the decrease in the workers compensation massive injury reserves in 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily due to the settlement of two claims, offset somewhat by the addition of two new claims. a 100-basis point increase in the medical cost inflation assumption would result in an increase in the property and casualty group's december 31, 2014 gross reserve of $20 million. this increase in the medical cost inflation assumption would also increase the related reinsurance recoverable and the workers compensation discount by $16 million, resulting in a $4 million increase in the net reserve.
reserve adequacy we also perform analyses to evaluate the adequacy of past total reserve levels for the property and casualty group. previously established estimates for reserves were not materially different than those determined in these retrospective analyses. at december 31, 2014, our current estimate of direct loss reserves, including salvage and subrogation for accident years 2013 and prior is $120 million, or 3.2% less than the reserve amount we had established at december 31, 2013. at december 31, 2013, our estimate of direct loss reserves, including salvage and subrogation recoveries for accident years 2012 and prior was
$2 million, or 0.1% higher than the reserve amount we had established at december 31, 2012. at december 31, 2012, our estimate of direct loss reserves, including salvage and subrogation recoveries for accident years 2011 and prior was
$92 million, or 2.6% lower than the reserve amount we had established at december 31, 2011. see an additional discussion of our reserve development in the "prior year loss reserve development" section.
life insurance and annuity policy reserves reserves for traditional life insurance future policy benefits are computed primarily by the net level premium method.  generally, benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related reserves are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid reduced by the present value of future expected net premiums.  such reserves are established based upon methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with gaap and applicable actuarial standards.  principal assumptions used in the establishment of policy reserves are mortality, lapses, expenses, and investment yields.  mortality assumptions are based upon tables typically used in the industry, modified to reflect actual experience and to include a provision for the risk of adverse deviation where appropriate.  lapse, expense, and investment yield assumptions are based upon actual company experience and may include a provision for the risk of adverse deviation.  assumptions on these policies are locked in at the time of issue and are not subject to change unless a premium deficiency exists.  a premium deficiency exists if, based upon revised assumptions, the existing contract liabilities together with the present value of future gross premiums are not sufficient
34
to cover the present value of future expected benefits and maintenance costs and to recover unamortized acquisition costs.  historically, our reserves plus expected gross premiums have been demonstrated to be sufficient.  there were no premium deficiencies in 2014, 2013 or 2012.
reserves for income-paying annuity future policy benefits are computed as the present value of future expected benefits.  principal assumptions used in the establishment of policy reserves are mortality and investment yields.  interest rates used to discount future expected benefits are set at the policy level and range from 1.50% to 9.0%.  the equivalent aggregate interest rate is 5.7%.  if the aggregate interest rate was reduced by 100 basis points, the present value of future expected benefits would increase by $16 million at december 31, 2014.
reserves for universal life and deferred annuity plans are primarily based upon the contract account balance without reduction for surrender charges.
investment valuation available-for-sale and trading securities we make estimates concerning the valuation of all investments.  valuation techniques are used to derive the fair value of the available-for-sale and trading securities we hold.  fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date.
fair value measurements are based upon observable and unobservable inputs.  observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.  we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
for purposes of determining whether the market is active or inactive, the classification of a financial instrument was based upon the following definitions:
•   an active market is one in which transactions for the assets being valued occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information.
•   an inactive (illiquid) market is one in which there are few and infrequent transactions, where the prices are not current, price quotations vary substantially, and/or there is little information publicly available for the asset being valued.
we continually assess whether or not an active market exists for all of our investments and as of each reporting date re-evaluate the classification in the fair value hierarchy.  all assets carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
•   level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date.
•   level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
•   level 3 - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
level 1 primarily consists of publicly traded common stock, nonredeemable preferred stock, and exchange traded funds and reflects market data obtained from independent sources, such as prices obtained from an exchange or a nationally recognized pricing service for identical instruments in active markets.
level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as the interest rate and credit spread for the underlying financial instruments.  all significant inputs are observable, or derived from observable information in the marketplace, or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.  financial instruments in this category primarily include corporate bonds, municipal bonds, structured securities, redeemable preferred stock and certain nonredeemable preferred stock.
level 3 securities are valued based upon unobservable inputs, reflecting our estimates of value based upon assumptions used by market participants.  securities are assigned to level 3 in cases where non-binding broker quotes are significant to the valuation and there is a lack of transparency as to whether these quotes are based upon information that is observable in the
35
marketplace.  fair value estimates for securities valued using unobservable inputs require significant judgment due to the illiquid nature of the market for these securities and represent the best estimate of the fair value that would occur in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.  fair value for these securities are generally determined using comparable securities or non-binding broker quotes received from outside broker dealers based upon security type and market conditions.  remaining securities, where a price is not available, are valued using an estimate of fair value based upon indicative market prices that include significant unobservable inputs not based upon, nor corroborated by, market information, including the utilization of discounted cash flow analyses which have been risk-adjusted to take into account illiquidity and other market factors.  this category primarily consists of corporate bonds priced using non-binding broker quotes as well as certain private securities.
as of each reporting period, financial instruments recorded at fair value are classified based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  the presence of at least one unobservable input would result in classification as a level 3 instrument.  our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset, such as the relative impact on the fair value as a result of including a particular input and market conditions.  we did not make any other significant judgments except as described above.
estimates of fair values for our investment portfolio are obtained primarily from a nationally recognized pricing service.  our level 1 category includes those securities valued using an exchange traded price provided by the pricing service.  the methodologies used by the pricing service that support a level 2 classification of a financial instrument include multiple verifiable, observable inputs including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data.  pricing service valuations for level 3 securities are based upon proprietary models and are used when observable inputs are not available in illiquid markets.  in limited circumstances we adjust the price received from the pricing service when, in our judgment, a better reflection of fair value is available based upon corroborating information and our knowledge and monitoring of market conditions such as a disparity in price of comparable securities and/or non-binding broker quotes. in other circumstances, certain securities are internally priced because prices are not provided by the pricing service.
we perform continuous reviews of the prices obtained from the pricing service.  this includes evaluating the methodology and inputs used by the pricing service to ensure we determine the proper classification level of the financial instrument.  price variances, including large periodic changes, are investigated and corroborated by market data.  we have reviewed the pricing methodologies of our pricing service as well as other observable inputs, such as benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, and transaction volumes, and believe that the prices adequately consider market activity in determining fair value.  our review process continues to evolve based upon accounting guidance and requirements.
when a price from the pricing service is not available, values are determined by obtaining non-binding broker quotes and/or market comparables.  when available, we obtain multiple quotes for the same security.  the ultimate value for these securities is determined based upon our best estimate of fair value using corroborating market information.  our evaluation includes the consideration of benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data.
other-than-temporary impairments investments are evaluated monthly for other-than-temporary impairment loss.  some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary include:
•   the extent and duration for which fair value is less than cost;
•   historical operating performance and financial condition of the issuer;
•   short- and long-term prospects of the issuer and its industry based upon analysts' recommendations;
•   specific events that occurred affecting the issuer, including rating downgrades;
•   intent to sell or more likely than not be required to sell (debt securities); and
•   ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value (equity securities).
for available-for-sale equity securities, a charge is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for positions that have experienced other-than-temporary impairments. for debt securities in which we do not expect full recovery of amortized cost, the security is deemed to be credit-impaired.  credit-related impairments and impairments on securities we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.  it is our intention to sell all debt securities with credit impairments.
36
limited partnerships the primary basis for the valuation of limited partnership interests is financial statements prepared by the general partner.  because of the timing of the preparation and delivery of these financial statements, the use of the most recently available financial statements provided by the general partners generally result in a quarter delay in the inclusion of the limited partnership results in our consolidated statements of operations.  due to this delay, these financial statements do not reflect the market conditions experienced in the fourth quarter of 2014.
the majority of our limited partnership holdings are considered investment companies where the general partners record assets at fair value. these limited partnerships are recorded using the equity method of accounting. we also own some real estate limited partnerships that do not meet the criteria of an investment company. these partnerships prepare audited financial statements on a cost basis. we have elected to report these limited partnerships under the fair value option, which is based on the net asset value (nav) from our partner's capital statement reflecting the general partner's estimate of fair value for the fund's underlying assets. fair value provides consistency in the evaluation and financial reporting for these limited partnerships and limited partnerships accounted for under the equity method.
we have three types of limited partnership investments: private equity, mezzanine debt, and real estate.  our private equity and mezzanine debt partnerships are diversified among numerous industries and geographies to minimize potential loss exposure. nearly all of the underlying investments in our limited partnerships are valued using a source other than quoted prices in active markets. the fair value amounts for our private equity and mezzanine debt partnerships are based upon the financial statements prepared by the general partners, who use various methods to estimate fair value including the market approach, income approach, and the cost approach.  the market approach uses prices and other pertinent information from market-generated transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.  such valuation techniques often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables.  the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future cash flows or earnings to a single discounted present value amount.  the measurement is based upon the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts.  the cost approach is derived from the amount that is currently required to replace the service capacity of an asset.  if information becomes available that would impair the cost of investments owned by the partnerships, then the general partner would adjust the investments to the net realizable value.
the fair value of investments in real estate limited partnerships is determined by the general partner based upon independent appraisals and/or internal valuations.  real estate projects under development are generally valued at cost and impairment tested by the general partner.  we minimize the risk of market decline by avoiding concentration in a particular geographic area and are diversified across residential, commercial, industrial, and retail real estate investments.
while we perform various procedures in review of the general partners' valuations, we rely on the general partners' financial statements as the best available information to record our share of the partnership unrealized gains and losses resulting from valuation changes.  due to the limited market for these investments, there is the greatest potential for variability.  we survey each of the general partners quarterly about expected significant changes (plus or minus 10% compared to previous quarter) to valuations prior to the release of the fund's quarterly and annual financial statements. based upon that information from the general partner, we consider whether additional disclosure is warranted. we analyze limited partnerships measured at fair value based upon nav to determine if the most recently available nav reflects fair value at the balance sheet date, with an adjustment being made where appropriate (change of plus or minus 5% compared to most recent nav.)
deferred acquisition costs related to life insurance and investment-type contracts acquisition costs that vary with and relate to the production of life insurance and investment-type contracts are deferred. deferred acquisition costs ("dac") are incremental direct costs of contract acquisition. these costs are limited to the successful acquisition of new and renewal contracts. such costs consist principally of commissions and policy issuance expenses.
dac on life insurance and investment-type contracts are amortized in proportion to gross premiums or gross profits, depending on the type of contract.  dac related to traditional life insurance products is amortized in proportion to premium revenues over the premium-paying period of related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing policy liability reserves.  these assumptions are not revised after policy issuance unless the dac balance is deemed to be unrecoverable from future expected profits.  in any period where the actual policy terminations are higher (lower) than anticipated policy terminations, dac amortization will be accelerated (decelerated) in that period.
dac related to universal life products and deferred annuities is amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future gross profits, which include investment, mortality, and expense margins and surrender charges.  both historical and anticipated investment returns, including realized gains and losses, are considered in determining the amortization of dac.  when the actual gross profits change from previously estimated gross profits, the cumulative dac
37
amortization is re-estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to current operations.  when actual gross profits exceed those previously estimated, dac amortization will increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings.  the opposite result occurs when the actual gross profits are below the previously estimated gross profits.  dac is also adjusted for the impact of unrealized gains or losses on investments as if these gains or losses had been realized, with corresponding credits or charges, net of income taxes, included in efl's accumulated other comprehensive income, which is presented in the "noncontrolling interest in consolidated entity - exchange," amount in the consolidated statements of financial position.
the actuarial assumptions used to determine investment, mortality, and expense margins and surrender charges for universal life products and deferred annuities are reviewed periodically, are based upon best estimates and do not include any provision for the risk of adverse deviation.  if actuarial analysis indicates that expectations have changed, the actuarial assumptions are updated and the investment, mortality, and expense margins and surrender charges are unlocked.  if this unlocking results in a decrease in the present value of future expected gross profits, dac amortization for the period will increase.  if this unlocking results in an increase in the present value of future expected gross profits, dac amortization for the current period will decrease.
dac is periodically reviewed for recoverability.  for traditional life products, if the benefit reserves plus anticipated future premiums and interest earnings for a line of business are less than the current estimate of future benefits and expenses (including any unamortized dac), a charge to income is recorded for additional dac amortization or for increased benefit reserves.  for universal life products and deferred annuities, if the current present value of future expected gross profits is less than the unamortized dac, a charge to income is recorded for additional dac amortization.  there were no impairments to dac in 2014, 2013 or 2012.
deferred taxes deferred tax assets represent the tax benefit of future deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.  deferred tax assets are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such benefits are realized.  we perform an analysis of our deferred tax assets to determine recoverability on a quarterly basis for each legal entity, by character of the income (ordinary or capital).  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  in determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider carry-back capacity, reversal of existing temporary differences, future taxable income and tax planning strategies.  the determination of the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets requires us to make certain judgments and assumptions regarding future operations that are based upon our historical experience and our expectations of future performance.  our judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance, which is impacted by such things as financial market conditions, policyholder behavior, competitor pricing, new product introductions, and specific industry and economic conditions.
indemnity had a net deferred tax asset of $37 million and $2 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  there was no valuation allowance recorded on indemnity at december 31, 2014 or 2013. the exchange had a net deferred tax liability of $490 million and $450 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
retirement benefit plans for employees our pension plans consist of a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees and an unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan ("serp") for certain members of executive and senior management of the erie insurance group. although indemnity is the sponsor of these postretirement plans and records the funded status of these plans, the exchange and efl reimburse indemnity for approximately 56% of the annual benefit expense of these plans, which represents pension benefits for indemnity employees performing claims and efl functions.
our pension obligation is developed from actuarial estimates.  several statistical and other factors, which attempt to anticipate future events, are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans.  key factors include assumptions about the discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets.  we review these assumptions annually and modify them considering historical experience, current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates and expected future trends.
accumulated and projected benefit obligations are expressed as the present value of future cash payments.  we discount those cash payments based upon a yield curve developed from corporate bond yield information with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits.  lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense, while higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense.  the construction of the yield curve is based upon yields of corporate bonds rated aa quality.  target yields are developed from bonds at various maturity points and a curve is fitted to those targets.  spot rates (zero coupon bond yields) are developed from the yield curve and used to discount benefit payment amounts associated with each future year.  the present value of plan benefits is calculated by applying the spot/
38
discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.  a single discount rate is then developed to produce the same present value.  the cash flows from the yield curve were matched against our projected benefit payments in the pension plan, which have a duration of about 20 years.  this yield curve supported the selection of a 4.17% discount rate for the projected benefit obligation at december 31, 2014 and for the 2015 pension expense.  the same methodology was used to develop the 5.11% and 4.19% discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation for 2013 and 2012, respectively, and the pension expense for 2014 and 2013, respectively. a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would increase pension cost in the following year by $4 million and would increase the pension benefit obligation by $34 million.
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors, including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets.  these unrecognized gains and losses are recorded in the pension plan obligation and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated statements of financial position. these amounts are systematically recognized to net periodic pension expense in future periods, with gains decreasing and losses increasing future pension expense. if actuarial net gains or losses exceed 5% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market-related value of plan assets, the excess is recognized through the net periodic pension expense equally over the estimated service period of the employee group, which is currently 14 years.
the expected long-term rate of return for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid.  the expected long-term rate of return is less susceptible to annual revisions, as there are typically no significant changes in the asset mix.  to determine the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we utilized models based upon rigorous historical analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets based upon key factors such as historical returns for the asset class' applicable indices, the correlations of the asset classes under various market conditions and consensus views on future real economic growth and inflation.  the expected future return for each asset class is then combined by considering correlations between asset classes and the volatilities of each asset class to produce a reasonable range of asset return results within which our expected long-term rate of return assumption falls. a change of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $1.3 million impact on net pension benefit cost in the following year, of which indemnity's share would be approximately $0.6 million.
we use a four year averaging method to determine the market-related value of plan assets, which is used to determine the expected return component of pension expense.  under this methodology, asset gains or losses that result from returns that differ from our long-term rate of return assumption are recognized in the market-related value of assets on a level basis over a four year period.  the market-related asset experience during 2014 that related to the actual investment return being different from that assumed during the prior year was a gain of $42 million. recognition of this gain will be deferred and recognized over a four year period, consistent with the market-related asset value methodology.  once factored into the market-related asset value, these experience gains and losses will be amortized over a period of 14 years, which is the remaining service period of the employee group.
estimates of fair values of the pension plan assets are obtained primarily from our trustee and custodian of our pension plan.  our level 1 category includes a money market fund that is a mutual fund for which the fair value is determined using an exchange traded price provided by the trustee and custodian.  our level 2 category includes commingled pools.  estimates of fair values for securities held by our commingled pools are obtained primarily from the trustee and custodian.  the methodologies used by the trustee and custodian that support a financial instrument level 2 classification include multiple verifiable, observable inputs including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuers spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data. there were no level 3 investments in 2014 or 2013.
we expect our net pension benefit costs to increase from $26 million in 2014 to $39 million in 2015. this increase is due to both the lower discount rate and the adoption of the newly issued mortality tables, partially offset by a change in other plan assumptions that were updated to reflect our most recent actual experience. indemnity's share of the net pension benefit costs after reimbursements will increase from $12 million in 2014 to approximately $17 million in 2015.
the actuarial assumptions we used in determining our pension obligation may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants.  while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 15, postretirement benefits, of notes to consolidated financial statements" contained within this report for additional details on the pension plans.

management fee revenue management fee revenue is based upon all premiums written or assumed by the exchange and the management fee rate, which is determined by our board of directors at least annually.  management fee revenue is calculated by multiplying the management fee rate by the direct premiums written by the exchange and the other members of the property and casualty group, which are assumed by the exchange under an intercompany pooling agreement.  the following table presents the calculation of management fee revenue:

(1)          management fees are returned to the exchange when policies are cancelled mid-term and unearned premiums are refunded.  we record an estimated allowance for management fees returned on mid-term policy cancellations.
management fee revenue increased $110 million, or 8.7%, in 2014, compared to 2013. direct written premium of the property and casualty group increased 8.6% in 2014, compared to 2013, due to a 4.3% increase in policies in force and a 4.2% increase in the year-over-year average premium per policy for all lines of business.  the year-over-year policy retention ratio was 90.3% at december 31, 2014, 90.6% at december 31, 2013, and 90.9% at december 31, 2012.  see the "property and casualty insurance operations" segment that follows for a complete discussion of property and casualty direct written premium, which has a direct bearing on indemnity's management fee. the management fee rate was set at 25%, the maximum rate, for 2014, 2013 and 2012.  the management fee rate for 2015 was set at 25% by our board of directors.  changes in the management fee rate can affect the indemnity shareholder interest's revenue and net income from this segment significantly.  see also, the "transactions/agreements between indemnity and noncontrolling interest (exchange), board oversight" section within this report.
service agreement revenue service agreement revenue includes service charges indemnity collects from policyholders for providing extended payment terms on policies written by the property and casualty group and late payment and policy reinstatement fees.  the service
40
charges are fixed dollar amounts per billed installment.  service agreement revenue totaled $31 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012.  the consistency in the service agreement revenue compared to the growth in policies in force reflects the continued shift in policies to the monthly direct debit payment plan, which does not incur service charges, and the no-fee single payment plan, which offers a premium discount.  the shift to these plans is driven by the consumers' desire to avoid paying service charges and to take advantage of the discount in pricing offered for paid-in-full policies.

commissions - commissions increased $73 million in 2014 compared to 2013, and increased $75 million in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily as a result of the 8.6% and 9.6% respective increases in direct written premiums of the property and casualty group.  commission growth outpaced direct written premium growth in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to an increase in agent incentive costs related to profitable growth. also impacting the increase in 2013 was an adjustment that reduced commission expense by $6 million in 2012.  this amount represented the reimbursement by the north carolina reinsurance facility (ncrf) for commissions indemnity paid to agents on the surcharges collected on behalf of the ncrf which was incorrectly recorded as a benefit to the exchange in prior periods.
non-commission expense - non-commission expense increased $23 million in 2014 compared to 2013. information technology costs increased $13 million, which included $6 million of professional fees, $4 million of personnel costs, and
$3 million of hardware and software costs. underwriting and policy processing costs increased $7 million due to the increased cost of underwriting reports, postage, and printing costs related to increased volume. customer service costs increased
$4 million due to an increase of $2 million in credit card processing fees and $2 million in personnel costs. all other operating costs decreased $1 million.
in 2013, compared to 2012, non-commission expense increased $30 million. sales and advertising costs increased $4 million due to personnel costs.  underwriting and policy processing costs increased $9 million due to increased personnel costs and the increased cost of underwriting reports and postage and printing costs. information technology costs increased $5 million, which included $6 million of personnel costs, offset by a decrease of $1 million in software, hardware, and maintenance costs. customer service costs increased $3 million due to an increase of $2 million in credit card processing fees and $1 million in personnel costs. administrative and other costs increased $9 million driven by increases in professional fees and personnel costs of $5 million and $4 million, respectively. personnel costs in all expense categories were impacted by higher staffing levels, increased pension and medical costs, and increased estimates for incentive plan compensation costs related to growth and underwriting performance.
gross margin the gross margin in 2014 was 15.8%, compared to 16.1% in 2013 and 17.3% in 2012. excluding the adjustment in 2012 that reduced commission expense by $6 million (described above), the gross margin would have been 16.8% in 2012.

we measure profit or loss from our property and casualty insurance segment based upon its underwriting results, which are represented by net premiums earned less losses and loss expenses and policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses on a pre-tax basis.  the loss and loss expense ratio and combined ratio are key performance indicators that we use to assess business trends and to make comparisons to industry results.  the investment results related to our property and casualty insurance operations are included in our investment operations segment discussion.
premiums direct written premium - direct written premium of the property and casualty group increased 8.6% to $5.5 billion in 2014, from $5.1 billion in 2013, driven by an increase in policies in force and increases in average premium per policy.  year-over-year policies in force for all lines of business increased by 4.3% in 2014 as the result of continuing strong policyholder retention and an increase in new policies written, compared to 4.8% in 2013.  the year-over-year average premium per policy for all lines of business increased 4.2% at december 31, 2014, compared to 4.5% at december 31, 2013.
premiums generated from new business increased 5.8% to $695 million in 2014, compared to 15.6%, or $656 million, in 2013.  underlying the trend in new business premiums was a 2.9% increase in new business policies written in 2014, compared to 13.6% in 2013, while the year-over-year average premium per policy on new business increased 2.9% at december 31, 2014, compared to 1.8% at december 31, 2013.
premiums generated from renewal business increased 9.0% to $4.8 billion in 2014, compared to 8.8%, or $4.4 billion, in 2013.  underlying the trend in renewal business premiums were increases in average premium per policy and steady policy retention ratios. the renewal business year-over-year average premium per policy increased 4.3% at december 31, 2014, compared to
42
5.0% at december 31, 2013.  the property and casualty group's year-over-year policy retention ratio was 90.3% at december 31, 2014, 90.6% at december 31, 2013, and 90.9% at december 31, 2012.
the property and casualty group implemented rate increases in 2014, 2013, and 2012 in order to meet loss cost expectations.
as the property and casualty group writes policies with annual terms only, rate actions take 12 months to be fully recognized in written premium and 24 months to be fully recognized in earned premiums.  since rate changes are realized at renewal, it takes 12 months to implement a rate change to all policyholders and another 12 months to earn the increased or decreased premiums in full.  as a result, certain rate actions approved in 2013 were reflected in 2014, and recent rate actions in 2014 will be reflected in 2015. the property and casualty group continuously evaluates pricing and product offerings to meet consumer demands.
personal lines - total personal lines premiums written increased 7.9% to $3.9 billion in 2014, from $3.6 billion in 2013, driven by an increase of 4.3% in total personal lines policies in force and an increase of 3.5% in the total personal lines year-over-year average premium per policy.

future trends-premium revenue - we plan to continue our efforts to grow property and casualty group premiums and improve our competitive position in the marketplace.  expanding the size of our agency force through a careful agency selection process and increased market penetration in our existing operating territories will contribute to future growth as existing and new agents build their books of business with the property and casualty group.  at december 31, 2014, we had nearly 2,200 agencies with over 11,000 licensed property and casualty representatives. the property and casualty group began writing private passenger automobile, home insurance, and personal excess liability insurance in kentucky in the fourth quarter of 2014.
changes in premium levels attributable to the growth in policies in force directly affect the profitability of the property and casualty group and have a direct bearing on indemnity's management fee.  our continued focus on underwriting discipline and the maturing of our pricing sophistication models has contributed to the property and casualty group's growth in new policies in force, steady policy retention ratios, and increased average premium per policy.  the continued growth of our policy base is dependent upon the property and casualty group's ability to retain existing policyholders and attract new policyholders.  a lack of new policy growth or the inability to retain existing customers could have an adverse effect on the property and casualty group's premium level growth, and consequently indemnity's management fee.
changes in premium levels attributable to rate changes also directly affect the profitability of the property and casualty group and have a direct bearing on indemnity's management fee.  pricing actions contemplated or taken by the property and casualty group are subject to various regulatory requirements of the states in which our insurers operate.  the pricing actions already implemented, or to be implemented, have an effect on the market competitiveness of our insurance products.  such pricing actions, and those of competitors, could affect the ability of our agents to retain and attract new business.  we expect the property and casualty group's pricing actions to result in a net increase in direct written premium in 2015, however, exposure reductions and/or changes in our mix of business as a result of economic conditions could impact the average premium written by the property and casualty group, as customers may reduce coverages.
losses and loss expenses current accident year, excluding catastrophe losses - the current accident year loss and loss expense ratio for all lines of business, excluding catastrophe losses, was 68.1% in 2014, compared to 66.8% in 2013 and 68.1% in 2012. the personal lines loss and loss expense ratio related to the current accident year, excluding catastrophe losses, was 67.9% in 2014, compared to 67.3% in 2013 and 68.5% in 2012. the commercial lines loss and loss expense ratio related to the current accident year, excluding catastrophe losses, was 68.6% in 2014, compared to 65.7% in 2013 and 67.1% in 2012. the higher ratios for 2014 were driven primarily by a higher volume of non-catastrophe weather related claims resulting from more severe winter weather experienced in the first quarter and a few large commercial property claims, compared to 2013.
current accident year catastrophe losses - catastrophic events, destructive weather patterns, or changes in climate conditions are an inherent risk of the property and casualty insurance business and can have a material impact on our property and casualty insurance underwriting results.  in addressing this risk, we employ what we believe are reasonable underwriting standards and monitor our exposure by geographic region. the property and casualty group's definition of catastrophes includes those weather-related or other loss events that we consider significant to our geographic footprint which, individually or in the aggregate, may not reach the level of a national catastrophe as defined by the property claim service ("pcs").
the property and casualty group maintains property catastrophe reinsurance coverage from unaffiliated reinsurers to mitigate future potential catastrophe loss exposures and no longer participates in the voluntary assumed reinsurance business, which lowers the variability of the property and casualty group's underwriting results. the property catastrophe reinsurance coverage during 2014 included a first treaty providing coverage of up to 30% of a loss of $100 million in excess of the property and casualty group's loss retention of $300 million per occurrence, a second treaty providing coverage of up to 90% of a loss of $500 million in excess of $400 million, a third treaty providing coverage of up to 85% of a loss of $200 million in excess of $900 million, and a fourth treaty providing coverage of up to 100% of a loss of $25 million in excess of $1.1 billion.  the property catastrophe reinsurance coverage that became effective for january 1, 2015 included a first property catastrophe reinsurance treaty providing coverage of up to 35% of a loss of $100 million in excess of the property and casualty group's loss retention of $300 million per occurrence, a second treaty providing coverage of up to 90% of a loss of $500 million in excess of $400 million, a third treaty providing coverage of up to 86% of a loss of $200 million in excess of $900 million, and a fourth treaty providing coverage of up to 100% of a loss of $25 million in excess of $1.1 billion.

while the property and casualty group is exposed to terrorism losses in commercial lines, including workers compensation, these lines are afforded a limited backstop above insurer deductibles for foreign acts of terrorism under the federal terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization and extension act of 2015 that continues through december 31, 2020.  there is no federal assistance for personal lines terrorism losses.  although current models suggest the most likely occurrences would not have a material impact on the property and casualty group, there is a chance that if future terrorism attacks occur, the property and casualty group could incur large losses.
catastrophe losses for the current accident year, as defined by the property and casualty group, totaled $395 million in 2014, $162 million in 2013, and $489 million in 2012, and contributed 7.5 points, 3.4 points and 11.0 points to the respective loss ratios. for 2014, catastrophe losses primarily resulted from many smaller events across our footprint and one large hail event in pennsylvania.

the 2014 direct business favorable development, including reserves for catastrophe losses and salvage and subrogation recoveries, totaled $120 million, improved the combined ratio by 2.3 points, and represented 3.2% of the net loss reserves at december 31, 2013.  the most significant factors contributing to the 2014 favorable development were:
•   favorable development of $78 million related to better than expected severity trends in personal auto, commercial multi-peril, and workers compensation lines of business. additionally, $42 million of favorable development was due to changes on individual claims, primarily workers compensation massive injury lifetime medical claims, personal auto massive injury lifetime medical claims, and the settlement of one commercial multi-peril individual large claim.
45
the 2013 direct business adverse development, including reserves for catastrophe losses and salvage and subrogation recoveries, totaled $2 million, contributing only 0.1 points to the combined ratio, and represented 0.1% of the net loss reserves at december 31, 2012.  the most significant factors contributing to the 2013 adverse development were:
•   adverse development of $29 million related to the personal auto and workers compensation massive injury lifetime medical claims due to increased annual claims cost expectations. this was offset somewhat by favorable development of $10 million due to the settlement of three massive injury lifetime medical claims. these primarily impacted accident years 2003 and prior.
•   favorable development of $22 million related to the personal auto line of business resulting from better than expected severity trends, offset somewhat by minor changes across all other lines of business, which impacted the
2012 accident year.
the 2012 direct business favorable development, including reserves for catastrophe losses and salvage and subrogation recoveries, totaled $92 million, improved the combined ratio by 2.1 points, and represented 2.6% of the net loss reserves at december 31, 2011.  the most significant factors contributing to the 2012 favorable development were:
•   favorable development of $54 million related to the homeowners line of business primarily resulting from improved claims frequency trends, which impacted the 2011 accident year, better than expected severity trends, which impacted the 2007 through 2011 accident years, and the closing of one large claim which impacted the 2010 accident year.
•   favorable development of $42 million related to the commercial multi-peril line of business primarily resulting from better than expected severity trends, which impacted the 2007 through 2011 accident years, and the closing of two large claims which impacted the 2006 through 2010 accident years.
•   favorable development of $11 million related to the commercial auto line of business primarily resulting from better than expected severity trends, which impacted the 2007 through 2011 accident years.
•   adverse development of $15 million related to the workers compensation line of business primarily resulting from increased severity trends, which impacted accident years 2000 through 2008.
additional information on direct loss reserve development is provided in item 1. "business, reserves for losses and loss expenses."  the variability in reserve development over the ten year period illustrates the uncertainty of the loss reserving process.  conditions and trends that have affected reserve development in the past will not necessarily recur in the future.  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future favorable or unfavorable reserve development based upon amounts experienced in prior years.
assumed reinsurance - the property and casualty group experienced adverse development on prior accident year loss reserves for its assumed involuntary reinsurance business totaling $4 million in 2014, compared to favorable development of
$13 million in 2013 and $14 million in 2012.  the adverse development in 2014 was primarily from the personal auto and workers compensation lines of business somewhat offset by favorable development in commercial auto. the favorable development in 2013 and 2012 was due to less than anticipated growth in involuntary reinsurance.
ceded reinsurance - the property and casualty group's ceded reinsurance reserve recoveries remained flat during 2014, compared to an increase of $8 million in 2013 and an increase of $9 million in 2012. an increase in ceded recoveries is reflected as favorable loss development as it represents an increase in recoveries resulting from adverse development on our direct loss reserves, while a decrease in ceded recoveries is reflected as adverse loss development as it represents a decrease in recoveries resulting from favorable development on our direct loss reserves.  ceded reinsurance reserves primarily relate to the pre-1986 automobile massive injury claims. in 2013, the increase in ceded recoveries was primarily due to adverse development related to the pre-1986 automobile massive injury claims and the commercial multi-peril and business catastrophe liability lines of business, offset somewhat by favorable development in the workers compensation line of business. in 2012, the increase in ceded recoveries was primarily the result of adverse development related to the pre-1986 automobile massive injury claims.
policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses - our policy acquisition and other underwriting expense ratio decreased 0.3% points to 28.5% in 2014, from 28.8% in 2013, and decreased 0.3 points in 2013 from 29.1% in 2012.  additionally, 2012 included an adjustment of $4 million which contributed 0.1 points to the combined ratio at december 31, 2012.  this adjustment represents the reimbursement by the north carolina reinsurance facility (ncrf) for commissions indemnity paid to agents on the surcharges collected on behalf of the ncrf which was incorrectly recorded as a benefit to the exchange in prior periods.  the management fee rate was 25.0% in 2014, 2013 and 2012.

policy revenue gross policy revenues increased 5.1% to $127 million in 2014, compared to $121 million in 2013, and $116 million in 2012.  efl uses, and has used, a variety of reinsurance programs to reduce claims volatility and for other financial benefits.  while the amount of risk that efl retains can vary based upon the type of policy issued and the year it was issued, efl generally does not retain more than $1 million of risk on any individual life. ceded reinsurance premiums totaled $41 million in 2014 and 2013, and $43 million in 2012.
annuity and universal life premiums that are recorded as deposits totaled $65 million, $59 million, and $58 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and therefore are not reflected in individual and group life premiums in the table above.
investment revenue efl's investment revenue decreased in 2014 due to a decrease in net realized gains on investments from the sale of bonds. offsetting this decrease was a slight increase in net investment income from higher bond earnings primarily due to increased holdings. efl's investment revenue increased in 2013 due to an increase in net realized gains on investments from the sale of bonds and a slight increase in equity in earnings of limited partnerships. offsetting these increases was a slight decrease in net investment income due to lower investment yields and a slight increase in impairment losses recognized in earnings due to bond impairments. see the discussion of investments in the "investment operations" segment that follows for further information.
benefits and expenses in 2014, total benefits and expenses were impacted by a decrease in benefits and other changes in policy reserves, as a result of a decrease in interest on annuity deposits partially offset by a slight increase in death benefits. amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs also decreased compared to 2013 as a result of the annual unlocking. in 2013, total benefits and expenses were primarily impacted by increases in benefits and other changes in policy reserves, as a result of increases in death benefits and future policy benefits, and the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, as a result of the annual unlocking, compared to 2012.

net investment income net investment income primarily includes interest and dividends on our fixed maturity and equity security portfolios.
indemnity's net investment income increased by $1 million in 2014, compared to 2013, and decreased by $1 million in 2013, compared to 2012, while net investment income for the exchange increased by $27 million and decreased by $14 million during the same respective periods.  the increase in net investment income for indemnity in 2014 was due to higher invested balances and higher investment yields, while the decrease in 2013 was primarily due to lower average invested balances. the increase in net investment income for the exchange in 2014 was due to an increase in invested balances partially offset by lower investment yields, while the decrease in 2013 was due to lower yields partially offset by an increase in invested balances.
net impairment losses recognized in earnings net impairment losses recognized in earnings for indemnity were $0.1 million in 2014, compared to $0.4 million in 2013, and $0.1 million in 2012.  impairment losses for the exchange totaled $4 million in 2014, compared to $13 million in 2013, and $0.1 million in 2012. the impairments for the exchange in 2014 and 2013 were related to several securities in unrealized loss positions that we intended to sell prior to an expected recovery to our cost basis.

(3)   the exchange's results include net realized gains from efl's operations of $9 million in 2014, $17 million in 2013, and $9 million in 2012.
net realized gains and losses on investments include the changes in fair value of common stocks designated as trading securities, and gains and losses resulting from the actual sales of all security categories.
indemnity generated net realized gains of $1 million in both 2014 and 2013, compared to gains of $5 million in 2012.  the exchange generated net realized gains of $192 million in 2014, compared to gains of $770 million in 2013 and $413 million in 2012. realized gains for indemnity were primarily attributable to gains from sales of equity securities in 2014, and gains from sales of fixed maturity securities in 2013. indemnity recorded no changes in fair value of common stocks in 2014 or 2013 due to the sale of its common stock portfolio classified as trading securities in the fourth quarter of 2012. in 2012, indemnity's net realized gains were primarily due to the favorable performance and sale of its common stock portfolio. realized gains for the exchange in 2014 primarily reflected gains from sales of common stock partially offset by decreases in fair value of common stock. realized gains for the exchange in 2013 and 2012 were primarily due to increases in fair value and realized gains on the sale of common stock securities reflecting favorable market performance.

limited partnership earnings pertain to investments in u.s. and foreign private equity, mezzanine debt, and real estate partnerships.  valuation adjustments are recorded to reflect the changes in fair value of the underlying investments held by the limited partnerships.  these adjustments are recorded as a component of equity in earnings of limited partnerships in the consolidated statements of operations.
limited partnership earnings tend to be cyclical based upon market conditions, the age of the partnership, and the nature of the investments.  generally, limited partnership earnings are recorded on a quarter lag from financial statements we receive from our general partners.  as a consequence, earnings from limited partnerships reported at december 31, 2014 reflect investment valuation changes resulting from the financial markets and the economy for the twelve month period ending september 30, 2014.
indemnity's equity in earnings of limited partnerships decreased by $11 million in 2014, compared to 2013, and increased by
$7 million in 2013, compared to 2012, while earnings for the exchange decreased by $37 million and increased by $23 million during the same respective periods. these changes in earnings for both indemnity and the exchange were the result of lower earnings from each investment sector in 2014, and primarily due to higher earnings from real estate investments in 2013.

financial condition investments we generate revenues from our fixed maturity, equity security and limited partnership investment portfolios to support our underwriting business.  the indemnity and exchange portfolios are managed with the objective of maximizing after-tax returns on a risk-adjusted basis, while the efl portfolio is managed to be closely aligned to its liabilities and to maintain a sufficient yield to meet profitability targets.

during 2014, indemnity increased its investments in non-investment grade fixed maturities from less than 1% of total invested assets at december 31, 2013 to 9% of total invested assets at december 31, 2014. the increase during 2014 was primarily funded by cash flows from limited partnership distributions. the exchange also increased its investment in non-investment grade fixed maturities during 2014 from 2% of total invested assets at december 31, 2013 to 5% of total invested assets at december 31, 2014. the increase during 2014 was primarily funded by cash flows from the sale of common stock and limited partnership distributions.
we continually review our investment portfolio to evaluate positions that might incur other-than-temporary declines in value.  we record impairment writedowns on investments in instances where the fair value of the investment is substantially below cost, and we conclude that the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, which includes consideration for intent to sell.
for all investment holdings, general economic conditions and/or conditions specifically affecting the underlying issuer or its industry, including downgrades by the major rating agencies, are considered in evaluating impairment in value.  in addition to specific factors, other factors considered in our review of investment valuation are the length of time the fair value is below cost and the amount the fair value is below cost.
we individually analyze all positions with emphasis on those that have, in our opinion, declined significantly below cost.  in compliance with impairment guidance for debt securities, we perform further analysis to determine if a credit-related impairment has occurred.  some of the factors considered in determining whether a debt security is credit impaired include potential for the default of interest and/or principal, level of subordination, collateral of the issue, compliance with financial covenants, credit ratings and industry conditions.  we have the intent to sell all credit-impaired debt securities, therefore the
51
entire amount of the impairment charges are included in earnings and no impairments are recorded in other comprehensive income.  for available-for-sale equity securities, a charge is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for positions that have experienced other-than-temporary impairments.  (see the "investment operations" section herein for further information.)  we believe our investment valuation philosophy and accounting practices result in appropriate and timely measurement of value and recognition of impairment.
fixed maturities under our investment strategy, we maintain a fixed maturity portfolio that is of high quality and well diversified within each market sector.  this investment strategy also achieves a balanced maturity schedule.  our fixed maturity portfolio is managed with the goal of achieving reasonable returns while limiting exposure to risk.  our municipal bond portfolio accounts for
$231 million, or 41%, of the total fixed maturity portfolio for indemnity and $1.5 billion, or 16%, of the fixed maturity portfolio for the exchange at december 31, 2014.  the overall credit rating of the municipal portfolio without consideration of the underlying insurance is aa.
fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, included in shareholders' equity.  indemnity's net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, net of deferred taxes, amounted to
$6 million at december 31, 2014, compared to $5 million at december 31, 2013.  at december 31, 2014, the exchange had net unrealized gains on fixed maturities of $303 million, compared to $234 million at december 31, 2013.

equity securities classified as available-for-sale include preferred and certain common stock securities, and are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial position with all changes in unrealized gains and losses reflected in other comprehensive income.  the unrealized gain on equity securities classified as available-for-sale, net of deferred taxes, for indemnity was $0.6 million at december 31, 2014, compared to an unrealized loss of less than $0.1 million at december 31, 2013. the net unrealized gain on equity securities classified as available-for-sale, net of deferred taxes, for the exchange was $40 million at december 31, 2014, compared to an unrealized gain of $26 million at december 31, 2013.
our common stocks classified as trading securities are measured at fair value with all increases or decreases in fair value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.
limited partnerships in 2014, investments in limited partnerships decreased for both indemnity and the exchange from the investment levels at december 31, 2013.  changes in partnership values are a function of contributions and distributions, adjusted for market value changes in the underlying investments. the decrease in limited partnership investments was due to net distributions received from the partnerships which were partially offset by increases in underlying asset values. indemnity has made no new limited partnership commitments since 2006, and the balance of its limited partnership investments is expected to decline over time as additional distributions are received. the results from our limited partnerships are based upon financial statements received from our general partners, which are generally received on a quarter lag. as a result, the market values and earnings recorded at december 31, 2014 reflect the partnership activity experienced during the twelve month period ending september 30, 2014.

liabilities property and casualty losses and loss expense reserves loss reserves are established to account for the estimated ultimate costs of losses and loss expenses for claims that have been reported but not yet settled and claims that have been incurred but not reported.  while we exercise professional diligence to establish reserves at the end of each period that are fully reflective of the ultimate value of all claims incurred, these reserves are, by nature, only estimates and cannot be established with absolute certainty.
the factors which may potentially cause the greatest variation between current reserve estimates and the actual future paid amounts include unforeseen changes in statutory or case law altering the amounts to be paid on existing claim obligations, new medical procedures and/or drugs with costs significantly different from those seen in the past, inflation, and claims patterns on current business that differ significantly from historical claims patterns.
losses and loss expense reserves are presented on the consolidated statements of financial position on a gross basis.  the following table represents the direct and assumed losses and loss expense reserves by major line of business for our property and casualty insurance operations.  the reinsurance recoverable amount represents the related ceded amounts which results in the net liability attributable to the property and casualty group.

(1)          loss reserves are set at estimated ultimate costs, except for workers compensation loss reserves which have been discounted using an interest rate of 2.5%.  this discounting reduced unpaid losses and loss expenses by $89 million and $85 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the reserves that have the greatest potential for variation are the massive injury lifetime medical claim reserves.  the property and casualty group is currently reserving for 245 claimants requiring lifetime medical care, of which 97 involve massive injuries.  the reserve carried by the property and casualty group for the massive injury claimants, which includes automobile massive injury and workers compensation massive injury reserves, totaled $274 million at december 31, 2014, which is net of $138 million of anticipated reinsurance recoverables, compared to $291 million at december 31, 2013, which was net of
54
$148 million of anticipated reinsurance recoverables.  the pre-1986 automobile and workers compensation massive injury gross reserves both decreased at december 31, 2014, compared to december 31, 2013, primarily due to continued payments on the pre-1986 automobile massive injury claims and the settlement of two workers compensation massive injury claims, offset somewhat by the addition of two new workers compensation massive injury claims, respectively.
the estimation of ultimate liabilities for these claims is subject to significant judgment due to variations in medical cost inflation, claimant health, and mortality over time.  it is anticipated that these massive injury lifetime medical claims will require payments over the next 30 to 40 years.  actual experience, however, may emerge in a manner that is different relative to the original assumptions, which could have a significant impact on our reserve estimates.  a 100-basis point increase in the medical cost inflation assumption would result in an increase in the combined automobile and workers compensation massive injury gross reserves of $84 million and a $41 million increase in the reinsurance recoverable and the workers compensation discount, resulting in a $43 million increase in the net reserve.  massive injury claims payments totaled $12 million,
$15 million, and $13 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
life insurance reserves efl's primary commitment is its obligation to pay future policy benefits under the terms of its life insurance and annuity contracts.  to meet these future obligations, efl establishes life insurance reserves based upon the type of policy, the age, gender, and risk class of the insured, and the number of years the policy has been in force.  efl also establishes annuity and universal life reserves primarily based upon the amount of policyholder deposits (less applicable insurance and expense charges) plus interest earned on those deposits.  life insurance and annuity reserves are supported primarily by efl's long-term, fixed income investments as the underlying policy reserves are generally also of a long-term nature.
shareholders' equity pension plan the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans is recognized in the statement of financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. at december 31, 2014, shareholders' equity decreased by $60 million, net of tax, of which $5 million represents amortization of the prior service cost and net actuarial loss and
$65 million represents the current period actuarial loss.  the 2014 actuarial loss was primarily due to the change in the discount rate assumption used to measure the future benefit obligations to 4.17% in 2014, from 5.11% in 2013. at december 31, 2013, shareholders' equity increased by $81 million, net of tax, of which $10 million represents amortization of the prior service cost and net actuarial loss and $71 million represents the current period actuarial gain.  the 2013 actuarial gain was primarily due to the change in the discount rate assumption used to measure the future benefit obligations to 5.11% in 2013, from 4.19% in 2012. although indemnity is the sponsor of these postretirement plans and records the funded status of these plans, the exchange and efl reimburse indemnity for approximately 56% of the annual benefit expense of these plans, which represents pension benefits for indemnity employees performing claims and efl functions.
impact of inflation property and casualty insurance premiums are established before losses occur and before loss expenses are incurred, and therefore, before the extent to which inflation may impact such costs is known. consequently, in establishing premium rates, we attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation, including medical cost inflation, construction and auto repair cost inflation, and tort issues.  medical costs are a broad element of inflation that impacts personal and commercial auto, general liability, workers compensation, and commercial multi-peril lines of insurance written by the property and casualty group.  inflation assumptions take the form of explicit numerical values in the survival ratio, individual claim, and massive injury lifetime medical reserving methods.  inflation assumptions are implicitly derived through the selection of applicable loss development patterns for all other reserving methods.  occasionally, unusual aberrations in loss development patterns are caused by external and internal factors such as changes in claim reporting, settlement patterns, unusually large losses, process changes, legal or regulatory changes, and other influences.  in these instances, analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses.

liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short- and long-term cash requirements of its business operations and growth needs.  our liquidity requirements have been met primarily by funds generated from premiums collected and income from investments.  our insurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are collected in advance of paying losses under the policies purchased with those premiums.  cash outflows for the property and casualty insurance operations are generally variable since settlement dates for liabilities for unpaid losses and the potential for large losses, whether individual or in the aggregate, cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.  accordingly, after satisfying our operating cash requirements, excess cash flows are used to build our investment operation's portfolios in order to increase future investment income, which then may be used as a source of liquidity if cash from our insurance operations would not be sufficient to meet our obligations.  cash provided from these sources is used primarily to fund losses and policyholder benefits, fund the costs of our management operations including commissions, salaries and wages, pension plans, share repurchases, dividends to shareholders, and the purchase and development of information technology.  we expect that our operating cash needs will be met by funds generated from operations.
volatility in the financial markets presents challenges to us as we do occasionally access our investment portfolio as a source of cash.  some of our fixed income investments, despite being publicly traded, are illiquid.  volatility in these markets could impair our ability to sell certain of our fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.  additionally, our limited partnership investments are significantly less liquid.  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs from other sources even if market volatility persists throughout 2015.

net cash provided by operating activities totaled $779 million in 2014, $903 million in 2013, and $577 million in 2012.  decreased cash from operating activities in 2014 was driven primarily by increases in losses and loss expense paid, commissions and bonuses paid to agents, and other underwriting and acquisition costs, combined with a decrease in limited partnership distributions received. somewhat offsetting this decrease in cash provided was an increase in premiums collected by the exchange, driven by the increase in premiums written, and an increase in net investment income received, combined with a decrease in income taxes paid, compared to 2013. the increase in 2013, compared to 2012, was primarily due to an increase in premiums collected by the exchange driven by the increase in premiums written, a decrease in losses and loss expense paid, and a slight increase in limited partnership distributions received. somewhat offsetting this increase in cash was an increase in income taxes and other underwriting and acquisition costs paid, and a slight decrease in net investment income received, compared to 2012.
at december 31, 2014, we recorded a net deferred tax asset of $37 million related to indemnity and a net deferred tax liability of $490 million related to the exchange.  there was no deferred tax valuation allowance recorded at december 31, 2014.  during calendar years 2014, 2013, and 2012, we received cash refunds of federal income taxes paid in prior tax periods of
$4 million, $4 million, and $49 million respectively.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $596 million in 2014, $759 million in 2013, and $85 million in 2012.  changes in investing activities in 2014 primarily included a decrease in certain fixed maturity purchases and increased cash generated from the sale of preferred stocks, offset somewhat by an increase in other preferred stock purchases combined with decreased cash generated from the sale, call and maturity of fixed income securities, compared to 2013.  at december 31, 2014, we had contractual commitments to invest up to $483 million related to our limited partnership investments to be funded as required by the partnerships' agreements.  of this amount, the total remaining commitment to fund limited partnerships that invest in private equity securities was $151 million, mezzanine debt securities was $165 million, and real estate activities was
$167 million.  changes in investing activities in 2013 primarily included an increase in certain fixed maturity purchases and decreased cash generated from the sale of common stocks, offset somewhat by a decrease in other common stock purchases, compared to 2012.

see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 22, indemnity supplemental information, of notes to consolidated financial statements" contained within this report for more detail on indemnity's cash flows.
net cash provided by indemnity's operating activities decreased to $186 million in 2014, compared to $218 million in 2013, and $205 million in 2012.  decreased cash from operating activities in 2014 was primarily due to increases in commissions and bonuses paid to agents and general operating expenses combined with decreases in reimbursements collected from affiliates and limited partnership distributions. somewhat offsetting this decrease in cash was an increase in management fee revenue received, compared to 2013. management fee revenues were higher reflecting the increase in premiums written or assumed by the exchange.  cash paid for agent commissions and bonuses increased to $749 million in 2014, compared to $681 million in 2013, as a result of an increase in cash paid for scheduled commissions and bonus awards.  indemnity contributed $23 million to its pension plan in 2014, compared to $17 million in 2013.  additionally, indemnity made a contribution to its pension plan for $17 million in january 2015.  our funding policy is generally to contribute an amount equal to the greater of the target normal cost for the plan year or the amount necessary to fund the plan to 100% plus interest to the date the contribution is made.  indemnity is reimbursed approximately 56% of the net periodic benefit cost of the pension plan from its affiliates, which represents pension benefits for indemnity employees performing claims and efl functions.  in 2013, increased cash from operating activities, compared to 2012, was primarily due to increases in management fee revenue and limited partnership distributions received. offsetting this increase in cash were increases in cash paid for commissions to agents, general operating expenses, salaries and wages, and income taxes, combined with a slight decrease in net investment income received, compared to 2012.
at december 31, 2014, indemnity recorded a net deferred tax asset of $37 million. there was no deferred tax valuation allowance recorded at december 31, 2014. during calendar year 2014, indemnity received cash refunds of federal income taxes paid in prior tax periods of $1 million.
net cash used in indemnity's investing activities totaled $4 million in 2014 and $65 million in 2013, compared to cash provided of $95 million in 2012.  changes in indemnity's 2014 investing activities primarily included increased cash generated from fixed maturity and equity security sales, somewhat offset by decreased cash generated from fixed maturity calls combined with an increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment, compared to 2013.  also impacting indemnity's future investing activities are limited partnership commitments, which totaled $24 million at december 31, 2014, and will be funded as required by the partnerships' agreements.  of this amount, the total remaining commitment to fund limited partnerships that invest in private equity securities was $10 million, mezzanine debt securities was $9 million, and real estate activities was $5 million.  changes in indemnity's 2013 investing activities primarily included decreased cash generated from the sales of fixed maturities and common stocks, compared to 2012.
net cash used in indemnity's financing activities totaled $139 million in 2014, $116 million in 2013, and $299 million in 2012.  the increase in cash used in financing activities for 2014 was driven by an increase in the cash outlay for dividends paid to shareholders, somewhat offset by a decrease in the cash outlay for share repurchases. decreased cash used in financing activities in 2013 was driven by a decrease in dividends paid to shareholders, due to the accelerated payment of the regular first quarter 2013 dividend into the fourth quarter of 2012 and a special one-time cash dividend, and a decrease in the cash outlay for share repurchases. dividends paid to shareholders totaled $119 million, $84 million, and $229 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. indemnity increased both its class a and class b shareholder regular quarterly dividends for 2014 and 2013.  in 2012, in addition to the regular quarterly dividend declared in november, the board also declared a special one-time cash dividend of $2.00 on each class a share and $300.00 on each class b share, totaling $95 million. the payment of both the regular and special dividend was accelerated and paid in december 2012 due to the potential significant increases in tax rates on 2013 dividend income pending at the time of declaration. in 2013, the regular quarterly dividend was declared by the board at its december meeting and paid in january of the following year. there are no regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends to indemnity's shareholders.  dividends have been approved at a 7.2% increase for 2015.
57
indemnity repurchased 276,390 shares of its class a nonvoting common stock in conjunction with its stock repurchase program at a total cost of $19.5 million in 2014, based upon settlement date.  in 2013, shares repurchased under this program totaled 441,024 at a total cost of $31.9 million, compared to 986,439 shares at a total cost of $70.2 million in 2012.  in october 2011, our board of directors approved a continuation of the current stock repurchase program for a total of
$150 million with no time limitation.  this repurchase authority includes, and is not in addition to, any unspent amounts remaining under the prior authorization.  indemnity had approximately $18 million of repurchase authority remaining under this program at december 31, 2014, based upon trade date.
in 2014, we repurchased 64,398 shares of our outstanding class a nonvoting common stock outside of our publicly announced share repurchase program at a total cost of $4.9 million for the vesting of stock-based awards for executive management and an outside director, and for awards under our long-term incentive plan.  these shares were delivered in january, may and june 2014, respectively. in 2013, we repurchased 3,477 shares of our outstanding class a nonvoting common stock outside of our publicly announced share repurchase program at a total cost of $255,454 to settle payments due to a retired executive under our long-term incentive plan.  these shares were delivered to the plan participant in january 2013 and july 2013. in 2012, we also repurchased 1,803 shares of our outstanding class a nonvoting common stock outside of our publicly announced share repurchase program at a total cost of $129,849 to settle payments due to two retired senior vice presidents under our long-term incentive plan. these shares were delivered to the plan participants in january 2012 and june 2012, respectively.
capital outlook we regularly prepare forecasts evaluating the current and future cash requirements of indemnity and the exchange for both normal and extreme risk events.  should an extreme risk event result in a cash requirement exceeding normal cash flows, we have the ability to meet our future funding requirements through various alternatives available to us.
indemnity outside of indemnity's normal operating and investing cash activities, future funding requirements could be met through:
1) indemnity's cash and cash equivalents, which total approximately $92 million at december 31, 2014, 2) a $100 million bank revolving line of credit held by indemnity, and 3) liquidation of assets held in indemnity's investment portfolio, including common stock, preferred stock, and investment grade bonds which totaled approximately $411 million at december 31, 2014.  volatility in the financial markets could impair indemnity's ability to sell certain of its fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.  additionally, indemnity has the ability to curtail or modify discretionary cash outlays such as those related to shareholder dividends and share repurchase activities.
as of december 31, 2014, indemnity has access to a $100 million bank revolving line of credit with a $25 million letter of credit sublimit that expires on november 3, 2018. as of december 31, 2014, a total of $98 million remains available under the facility due to $2 million outstanding letters of credit, which reduce the availability for letters of credit to $23 million.  indemnity had no borrowings outstanding on its line of credit as of december 31, 2014. bonds with a fair value of
$114 million were pledged as collateral on the line at december 31, 2014. these securities have no trading restrictions and are reported as available-for-sale fixed maturities in the consolidated statements of financial position.  the bank requires compliance with certain covenants, which include leverage ratios.  indemnity was in compliance with its bank covenants at december 31, 2014.
exchange outside of the exchange's normal operating and investing cash activities, future funding requirements could be met through:
1) the exchange's cash and cash equivalents, which total approximately $422 million at december 31, 2014, 2) a $300 million bank revolving line of credit held by the exchange, and 3) liquidation of assets held in the exchange's investment portfolio, including common stock, preferred stock, and investment grade bonds which totaled approximately $12.1 billion at december 31, 2014.  volatility in the financial markets could impair the exchange's ability to sell certain of its fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.
as of december 31, 2014, the exchange has access to a $300 million bank revolving line of credit with a $25 million letter of credit sublimit that expires on october 25, 2018. as of december 31, 2014, a total of $299 million remains available under the facility due to $1 million outstanding letters of credit, which reduce the availability for letters of credit to $24 million.  the exchange had no borrowings outstanding on its line of credit as of december 31, 2014.  bonds with a fair value of
$328 million were pledged as collateral on the line at december 31, 2014. these securities have no trading restrictions and are reported as available-for-sale fixed maturities in the consolidated statements of financial position.  the bank requires compliance with certain covenants, which include statutory surplus and risk based capital ratios.  the exchange was in compliance with its bank covenants at december 31, 2014.
indemnity has no rights to the assets, capital, or line of credit of the exchange and, conversely, the exchange has no rights to the assets, capital, or line of credit of indemnity.  we believe we have the funding sources available to us to support our cash flow requirements in 2015.

contractual obligations cash outflows for the property and casualty group are variable as fluctuations in settlement dates for claims payments vary and cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.  while volatility in claims payments could be significant, the cash flow requirements for claims have not historically had a significant effect on our liquidity.  based upon a historical 15 year average, approximately 35% of losses and loss expenses included in reserves for the property and casualty group are settled within the first 12 months, and approximately 80% are settled within the first five years.  amounts that are paid after the first five years reflect long-tail lines such as workers compensation and auto bodily injury.
we have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under various contracts.  as of december 31, 2014, the aggregate obligations were as follows:

(1)   limited partnership commitments will be funded as required for capital contributions at any time prior to the agreement expiration date. the commitment amounts are presented using the expiration date as the factor by which to age when the amounts are due. at december 31, 2014, indemnity's total commitment to fund limited partnerships that invest in private equity securities was $10 million, mezzanine debt was $9 million, and real estate activities was $5 million. at december 31, 2014, the exchange's total commitment to fund limited partnerships that invest in private equity securities was $141 million, mezzanine debt was $156 million, and real estate activities was $162 million.
(2)   the pension contribution for 2015 was estimated in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006. contributions anticipated in future years depend upon certain factors that cannot be reasonably predicted. any contributions required in future years will be an amount equal to the greater of the target normal cost for the plan year or the amount necessary to fund the plan to 100% plus interest to the date the contribution is made. the obligations for our unfunded benefit plans, including the supplemental employee retirement plan (serp) for our executive and senior management, are not included in gross contractual obligations. the recorded accumulated benefit obligation for this plan at december 31, 2014, is $10 million. we expect to have sufficient cash flows from operations to meet the future benefit payments as these become due.
(3)   other commitments include various agreements for services, including such things as computer software, telephones, copiers, and maintenance.
(4)   operating leases - real estate are for 18 of our 25 field offices that are operated in the states in which the property and casualty group does business and two operating leases are for office space and a warehouse facility leased from unaffiliated parties.
(5)   life gross long-term liabilities represent estimated benefit payments from insurance policies and annuity contracts including claims currently payable. actual obligations in any single year will vary based upon actual mortality, morbidity, lapse, and withdrawal experience. the sum of these obligations exceeds the liability on the consolidated statements of financial position of $1.8 billion due to expected future premiums and investment income that, along with invested assets backing the liabilities, will be used to fund these obligations.
(6)   reinsurance recoverables include estimated amounts from reinsurers on long-term liabilities subject to the credit worthiness of the reinsurer.
59
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements include those with unconsolidated entities that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations, including material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that conduct certain activities.  we have no material off-balance sheet obligations or guarantees, other than limited partnership investment commitments.
financial ratings our property and casualty insurers are rated by rating agencies that provide insurance consumers with meaningful information on the financial strength of insurance entities.  higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a strong ability to pay claims.  the ratings are generally based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward return to investors.  the insurers of the property and casualty group are currently rated by a.m. best company as follows:
erie insurance exchange                        a+
erie insurance company                         a+
erie insurance property and casualty company   a+
erie insurance company of new york             a+
flagship city insurance company                a+
erie family life insurance company             a the outlook for all ratings is stable.  according to a.m. best, a "superior" rating (a+), the second highest financial strength rating category, is assigned to those companies that, in a.m. best's opinion, have achieved superior overall performance when compared to the standards established by a.m. best and have a superior ability to meet obligations to policyholders over the long term.  only 9.7% of insurance groups are rated a+ or higher, and we are included in that group.  by virtue of its affiliation with the property and casualty group, efl is typically rated one level lower, or an "excellent" rating (a), than our property and casualty insurance companies by a.m. best company.  financial strength ratings continue to be an important factor in evaluating the competitive position of insurance companies.
regulatory risk-based capital the standard set by the national association of insurance commissioners (naic) for measuring the solvency of insurance companies, referred to as risk-based capital (rbc), is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile.  the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify, for the purpose of initiating regulatory action, insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized.  in addition, the formula defines minimum capital standards that will supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state-by-state basis.  at december 31, 2014, the members of the property and casualty group and efl had rbc levels substantially in excess of levels that would require regulatory action.
regulatory restrictions on surplus the members of the property and casualty group and efl are subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the maximum amount of dividends available to be paid without prior approval by insurance regulatory authorities.  the exchange's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have a maximum of $35 million available for such dividends in 2015 without prior approval by the pennsylvania insurance commissioner for pennsylvania-domiciled subsidiaries and the new york superintendent of insurance for the new york domiciled subsidiary.  no dividends were paid from the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries in 2014, 2013, or 2012.
the maximum dividend efl could pay the exchange in 2015 without prior approval is $30 million.  no dividends were paid by efl in 2014, 2013 or 2012.
the exchange is operated for the interest of its subscribers (policyholders) and any distributions it might declare would only be payable to them.  the exchange did not make any distributions to its subscribers (policyholders) in 2014, 2013, or 2012.
enterprise risk management the role of our enterprise risk management ("erm") function is to ensure that all significant risks are clearly identified, understood, proactively managed and consistently monitored to achieve strategic objectives for all stakeholders of the erie insurance group. see item 1a "risk factors" contained in this report for a list of risk factors related to the erie insurance group.

as an insurance company, we are in the business of taking risks from our policyholders, managing these risks in a cost-effective manner and ensuring long term stability for policyholders as well as shareholders. since risk is integral to our business, we strive to manage the multitude of risks we face in an optimal manner. some risks can occur simultaneously or be correlated with other risks. therefore an event or a series of events has the potential to impact multiple areas of our business and materially affect our operations, financial position or liquidity. as such, our erm program takes a holistic view of risk and ensures implementation of risk responses to mitigate potential impacts across our entire group of companies.
our erm process is founded on a governance framework that includes oversight at multiple levels of our organization, including our board of directors and executive management. accountability to identify, manage, and mitigate risk is embedded within all functions and areas of our business. we have defined risk tolerances to monitor and manage significant risks within acceptable levels. in addition to identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, monitoring, and mitigating significant risks, our erm process includes extreme event analyses and scenario testing. financial and catastrophe modeling enable us to quantify risk within our property and casualty insurance operations and investment portfolio. model output is used to quantify the potential variability of future performance and the sufficiency of capital levels given our defined tolerance for risk. these models provide insight into capital management, allocation of capital by product lines, catastrophe exposure management, and reinsurance purchasing decisions. additionally, erm tools have been developed and modified to enhance our ability to assess project level risk and to provide senior management with pertinent risk information, enabling them to make better informed decisions.
insurers are required to regularly conduct an own risk and solvency assessment ("orsa") starting in 2015. orsa regulation requires insurance companies to document their risk management framework, assess individual material risks, and test group capital and solvency. this will allow regulators to form an enhanced view of an insurer's ability to withstand stress.

subscriber's agreement indemnity serves as attorney-in-fact for the policyholders at the exchange, a reciprocal insurance exchange.  each applicant for insurance to a reciprocal insurance exchange signs a subscriber's agreement that contains an appointment of an attorney-in-fact.  through the designation of attorney-in-fact, indemnity is required to provide sales, underwriting, and policy issuance services to the policyholders of the exchange, as discussed previously.  pursuant to the subscriber's agreement, indemnity earns a management fee for these services calculated as a percentage of the direct premiums written by the exchange and the other members of the property and casualty group, which are assumed by the exchange under an intercompany pooling arrangement.
intercompany agreements pooling members of the property and casualty group participate in an intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement.  under the pooling agreement, all insurance business of the property and casualty group is pooled in the exchange.  the erie insurance company and erie insurance company of new york share in the underwriting results of the reinsurance pool through retrocession.  since 1995, the board of directors has set the allocation of the pooled underwriting results at 5.0% participation for erie insurance company, 0.5% participation for erie insurance company of new york, and 94.5% participation for the exchange.

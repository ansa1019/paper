item 1a.   risk factors in addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
risks related to our business and operations entity mergers or consolidations and business failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and making us more dependent on a more limited number of clients.
there has been and continues to be substantial consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry. in addition, many financial institutions that experienced negative operating results, including some of our clients, have failed. these consolidations and failures reduce our number of potential clients and may reduce our number of existing clients, which could adversely affect our revenues, even if the events do not reduce the aggregate activities of the consolidated entities. further, if our clients fail and/or merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce use of our services. it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide. any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
if we fail to innovate or adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace, or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful, we could lose clients or our clients could lose customers and have difficulty attracting new clients for our services.
the markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes, frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards. our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current services, and develop and introduce new services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers. these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new service development effort, including cost overruns, delays in delivery, and performance issues. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing, marketing and selling new services that meet these changing demands, that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction, and marketing of these services, or that our new services and their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. any of these developments could have an adverse impact on our future revenues and/or business prospects.
we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
the market for our services is intensely competitive. our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer. some of our competitors have substantial resources. we face direct competition from third parties, and since many of our larger potential clients have historically developed their key applications in-house and therefore view their system requirements from a make-versus-buy perspective, we often compete against our potential clients' in-house capacities. in addition, we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies. there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. see "item i. business. competition."
10
global economic, political and other conditions, including business cycles and consumer confidence, may adversely affect our clients or trends in consumer spending, which may adversely impact the demand for our services and our revenue and profitability.
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees. the global transaction processing industries depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer, business and government spending. any change in economic factors, including a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions or consumer confidence, particularly in the united states, or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer spending, including related consumer debt, reduce check writing and change credit and debit card usage, and as a result, adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions that we service.
constraints within global financial markets or international regulatory requirements could constrain our financial institution clients' ability to purchase our services, impacting our future growth and profitability.
a significant number of our clients and potential clients may hold sovereign debt of economically struggling nations or be subject to emerging international requirements such as basel iii, which could require changes in their capitalization and hence the amount of their working capital available to purchase our services. these potential constraints could alter the ability of clients or potential clients to purchase our services and thus could have a significant impact on our future growth and profitability.
potential clients may be reluctant to switch to a new vendor, which may adversely affect our growth.
for banks and other potential clients of our financial information software and services, switching from one vendor of bank core processing or related software and services (or from an internally-developed system) to a new vendor is a significant undertaking. many potential clients perceive potential disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality, increased costs (including conversion costs) and business disruption. as a result, potential clients may resist change. we seek to overcome this resistance through value enhancing strategies such as a defined conversion process, system integration including bundling additional services and making ongoing investments to enhance the functionality of our software. however, there can be no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential clients' reluctance to change vendors will be successful, and this resistance may adversely affect our growth.
the sales and implementation cycles for many of our software and service offerings can be lengthy and require significant investment from both our clients and fis. if we fail to close sales or if a client chooses not to complete an installation after expending significant time and resources to do so, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.
the sales and associated deployment of many of our software or service offerings often involve significant capital commitments by our clients and/or fis. potential clients generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and services and require us to expend substantial time, effort, and money educating them prior to sales. further, as part of the sale or deployment of our software and services, clients may also require fis to perform significant related services to complete a proof of concept or custom development to meet their needs. all of the aforementioned activities may expend significant funds and management resources and, ultimately, the client may determine not to close the sale or complete the implementation. if we are unsuccessful in closing sales or if the client decides not to complete an implementation after we expend significant funds and management resources or we experience delays, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
failure to obtain new clients or renew client contracts on favorable terms could adversely affect results of operations and financial condition.
we may face pricing pressure in obtaining and retaining our larger clients. larger clients may be able to seek price reductions from us when they renew a contract, when a contract is extended, or when the client's business has significant volume changes. they may also reduce services if they decide to move services in-house. further, our smaller and mid-size clients may exert pricing pressure due to pricing competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by the client. on some occasions, this pricing pressure results in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with that client. this reduction in revenue could result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
further, failure to renew client contracts on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our business. our contracts with clients generally run for several years and include liquidated damage provisions that provide for early termination fees. term
11
s are generally renegotiated prior to the end of a contract's term. if we are not successful in achieving a high rate of contract renewals on favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
we may experience defects, development delays, installation difficulties, system failure, or other service disruptions with respect to our technology solutions, or execution problems with our transformation services, which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability.
many of our services, including our transformation services, are based on sophisticated software and computing systems, and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services. further, the technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released. in addition, we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our clients or our clients may cancel a project after we have expended significant effort and resources to complete an installation. finally, our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry and computer viruses. defects in our technology solutions, errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions, or other difficulties could result in: (i) interruption of business operations; (ii) delay in market acceptance; (iii) additional development and remediation costs; (iv) diversion of technical and other resources; (v) loss of clients; (vi) negative publicity; or (vii) exposure to liability claims. any one or more of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. although we attempt to limit our potential liability through controls, including system redundancies, security controls, application development and testing controls and disclaimers and limitation-of-liability provisions in our license and client agreements, we cannot be certain that these measures will always be successful in preventing disruption or limiting our liability.
the dodd-frank act may result in business changes for our clients that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, or prospects for future growth and overall business.
our clients, and as a result our associated software and services, are required to comply with numerous regulations. the dodd-frank act and associated durbin amendment were passed and signed into law in 2010. the dodd-frank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the regulations governing the financial services industry within the united states. the act established the consumer financial protection bureau and will require this and other federal agencies to implement many new regulations, which have the potential to increase the amount and types of regulation on areas of our business that were not previously regulated.
several new regulations and rules will be written and implemented as directed by the aforementioned legislation. these new rules and regulations will require our clients or potential clients to comply with new requirements and could require us to directly comply with new regulations. these new requirements could result in the need for fis to make capital investments to modify our products and services to facilitate our clients' and potential clients' compliance, as well as to deploy additional processes or reporting to comply with new regulations. further, requirements of the new regulations could result in changes in our clients' business practices and those of other marketplace participants that may alter the delivery of services to consumers, which could impact the demand for our software and services as well as alter the type or volume of transactions that we process on behalf of our clients. as a result, these new requirements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business.
many of our clients are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the number of transactions in which our clients engage and, therefore, reduces our revenues.
our clients are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our services must comply. our clients must ensure that our services and related products work within the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements applicable to them. federal, state, foreign or industry authorities could adopt laws, rules or regulations affecting our clients' businesses that could lead to increased operating costs and could reduce the convenience and functionality of our products and services, possibly resulting in reduced market acceptance. in addition, action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability, data usage, privacy, or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our clients and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
regulations enacted by the consumer financial protection bureau may require fis to enact new business practices which may require capital investment and/or incremental expenses which could impact our future operating results.
the consumer financial protection bureau regulates financial and non-financial institutions and providers to those organizations. the cfpb is establishing its regulatory agenda and will likely pass additional rules for regulating non-financial institution providers to ensure adequate protection of consumer privacy and to ensure consumers are not impacted by deceptive
12
business practices. the impact of these rules may require fis or its subsidiaries to be subject to additional regulation and adopt additional business practices that could require additional capital expenditures or impact our operating results.
our revenues from the sale of services to members of visa, mastercard, american express, discover and other similar organizations are dependent upon our continued certification and sponsorship, and the loss or suspension of certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business.
in order to provide our card processing services, we must be certified (including applicable sponsorship) by visa, mastercard, american express, discover and other similar organizations. these certifications are dependent upon our continued adherence to the standards of the issuing bodies and sponsoring member banks. the member financial institutions, some of which are our competitors, set the standards with which we must comply. if we fail to comply with these standards we could be fined, our certifications could be suspended, or our registration could be terminated. the suspension or termination of our certifications, or any changes in the rules and regulations governing visa, mastercard, american express, discover, or other similar organizations, could result in a reduction in revenue or increased costs of operation, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business.
changes in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit our operations.
from time to time, card associations and debit networks increase the interchange fees that they charge. it is possible that competitive pressures will result in our absorption of a portion of such increases in the future, which would increase our operating costs, reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation. furthermore, the rules and regulations of the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements. any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes.
interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide. the resulting regulatory changes that could occur from proposed regulations could alter the fees charged by card associations and debit networks worldwide. such changes could have an adverse impact on our business or financial condition due to reductions or changes in types of transactions processed on behalf of our clients. see "item i. business. government regulation" for more information.
if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or to meet regulatory expectations, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted.
the majority of our data processing services for financial institutions are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks, thrifts and credit unions. however, as a provider of services to these financial institutions, our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities and by international regulatory authorities, such as the fca, in certain jurisdictions. if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations or guidelines for operations of a data services provider, we could be subject to regulatory actions or regulatory rating changes, may not meet contractual obligations, or suffer harm to our client relationships or reputation. failure to meet the aforementioned requirements or to adapt to new requirements at the federal, state or international level could inhibit our ability to retain existing clients or obtain new clients, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
in addition to our data processing services described above, we also have business operations that store, process or transmit consumer information or have direct relationships with consumers that are obligated to comply with regulations, including, but not limited to, the federal fair credit reporting act, the federal fair debt collection practices act and applicable privacy requirements. further, our international businesses must comply with applicable laws such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act. failure to maintain compliance with or adapt to changes in any of the aforementioned requirements could result in fines, penalties or regulatory actions that could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
security breaches or attacks, or our failure to comply with information security laws, or regulations or industry security requirements, could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation and could result in a breach of one or more client contracts.
we electronically receive, process, store and transmit sensitive business information of our clients. in addition, we collect personal consumer data, such as names and addresses, social security numbers, driver's license numbers, cardholder data and payment history records. such information is necessary to support our clients' transaction processing and to conduct our check authorization and collection businesses. the uninterrupted operation of our information systems, as well as the confidentiality
13
of the customer/consumer information that resides on such systems, is critical to our successful operation. if we fail to maintain an adequate security infrastructure, adapt to emerging security threats, or implement sufficient security standards and technology to protect against security breaches, the confidentiality of the information we secure could be compromised. unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information, the deletion or modification of records, or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations. these risks are greater with increased information transmission over the internet and the increasing level of sophistication posed by cyber criminals.
our risk management and information security programs are the subject of ongoing review by the federal regulatory agencies with responsibility for oversight of our business. in late april 2014, the federal agencies that provide regulatory oversight for fis issued a confidential report related to their examination of our information security, risk management and internal audit functions between october 2012 and october 2013. we responded to the report and described the actions that we have taken, as well as ongoing efforts underway to address specific findings. the regulatory agencies distributed the report, and a cover letter, to a subset of our regulated clients beginning in may 2014. this prompted inquiries from clients, which, to the extent permitted by federal regulation, fis has addressed on an individual basis. we are unable to predict with certainty what, if any, further communications our regulators will have with our regulated financial institution clients. we are also unable to predict the effect that any such communications may have on our business. it remains possible that future actions by our regulators or clients related to this matter could have a material adverse impact on our business.
as a provider of services to financial institutions and a provider of card processing services, we are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information we receive from our clients as apply to the clients themselves. if we fail to comply with these regulations and industry security requirements, we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract, governmental proceedings, the imposition of fines, or prohibitions on card processing services. in addition, if more restrictive privacy laws, rules or industry security requirements are adopted in the future on the federal or state level, or by a specific industry body, they could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on business processes. any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches, or the perception that such breaches may occur, could cause our existing clients to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us, inhibit our ability to attract new clients, result in increasing regulation, or bring about other adverse consequences from the government agencies that regulate our business.
high profile payment card industry or digital banking security breaches could impact consumer payment behavior patterns in the future and reduce our card payment transaction volumes.
we are unable to predict whether or when high profile card payment or digital banking security breaches will occur and if they occur, whether consumers will transact less on their payment cards or reduce their digital banking service. if consumers transact less on cards issued by our clients or reduce digital banking services and we are not able to adapt to offer our clients alternative technologies, it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and related earnings.
misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights or a finding that our patents are invalid could impair our competitive position.
our ability to compete depends in some part upon our proprietary solutions and technology. despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or challenge the validity of our patents with governmental authorities. policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult. we cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable. effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online. misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others, we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties.
as our information technology applications and services develop, we are increasingly subject to infringement claims. any claims, whether with or without merit, could: (i) be expensive and time-consuming to defend; (ii) result in an injunction or other equitable relief which could cause us to cease making, licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; (iii) require us to redesign our applications, if feasible; (iv) divert management's attention and resources; and (v) require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or pay damages resulting from any infringing use.
we face liability to our merchant clients if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer's bank.
14
if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writers' banks, we must reimburse our merchant clients for the checks' face value and pursue collection from the check writers. in some cases, we recognize a liability to our merchant clients for estimated check returns and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the check writers, based on historical experience and other relevant factors. the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered by us may be less than our estimates. changes in economic conditions, the risk characteristics and composition of our clients and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts.
lack of system integrity, fraudulent payments, credit quality, undetected errors related to funds settlement or the availability of clearing services could result in a financial loss.
we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions, other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients, card issuers, payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types. transactions facilitated by us include debit card, credit card, electronic bill payment transactions, banking payments and check clearing that supports consumers, financial institutions and other businesses. these payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties, the facilitation of the payment as well as the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments. if our continuity of operations, integrity of processing, or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised, this could result in a financial loss to us. in addition, we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our products. if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. in addition, we may issue credit to consumers, financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement. a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us. furthermore, if one of our clients for which we facilitate settlement suffers a fraudulent event due to an error of their controls, we may suffer a financial loss if the client does not have sufficient capital to cover the loss.
failure to properly manage or mitigate risks in the operation of our wealth management businesses in the u.s and the u.k could have adverse liability consequences.
we have wealth management businesses in the u.s. and u.k. engaged in processing securities transactions on behalf of clients and serving as a custodian. failure to properly manage or mitigate risks in those operations and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the potential for and magnitude of resulting losses, including those that may arise from human errors or omissions, defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems or breakdowns in processes or in internal controls.  human errors or omissions may include failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures, theft, fraud or misappropriation of assets, whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties.  in addition, the u.s. based business holds charters in the states of georgia and delaware which exposes us to further regulatory compliance requirements of the georgia department of banking and finance and the office of the commissioner of banking in the state of delaware. the u.s. wealth management business is required to hold certain levels of regulatory capital as defined by the state banking regulators in the states in which they hold a bank or trust charter (delaware and georgia). in the u.k., our platform securities business is regulated by the fca and is subject to further regulatory capital requirements.
we have business in emerging markets such as brazil, india and southeast asia. these emerging markets may experience significant economic volatility in the future, which could add volatility to our revenue and earnings.
in our isg segment, we have operations in emerging markets, primarily in brazil, india and southeast asia. these emerging market economies tend to be more volatile than the more established markets we serve in north america and europe, which could add volatility to our future revenues and earnings.
our business is subject to the risks of international operations, including movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
our international operations represent approximately 22% of total 2014 revenues, which are largely conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, including the brazilian real, british pound, euro and indian rupee. as a result, our financial condition and operating results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including u.s. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), differences in business practices and changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local currencies. in addition, we are less well-known internationally than in the united states, have less experience with local business conditions and may face
15
challenges in successfully managing small operations located far from our headquarters, because of the greater difficulty in overseeing and guiding operations from a distance.
as we expand our international operations, more of our clients may pay us in foreign currencies. conducting business in currencies other than u.s. dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to foreign currencies in brazil, europe, australia and parts of asia. the u.s. dollar value of our net investments in foreign operations, the periodic conversion of foreign-denominated earnings to the u.s. dollar (our reporting currency), our results of operations and, in some cases, cash flows, could be adversely affected in a material manner by movements in foreign currency exchange rates. these risks could cause an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees or senior management personnel could harm our ability to grow.
our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled technical personnel. because the development of our products and services requires knowledge of computer hardware, operating system software, system management software and application software, our technical personnel must be proficient in a number of disciplines. competition for such technical personnel is intense, and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
our future growth will also require sales and marketing, financial and administrative personnel to develop and support new products and services, to enhance and support current products and services and to expand operational and financial systems. there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our growth strategies and we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to satisfy client demand in a timely fashion.
our ability to maintain compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and to manage and monitor the risks facing our business relies upon the ability to maintain skilled compliance, security, risk and audit professionals. competition for such skillsets is intense, and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have an adverse effect on our internal control environment and impact our operating results.
our senior management team has significant experience in the financial services industry, either at fis or with clients or competitors, and the loss of this leadership could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. further, the loss of this leadership may have an adverse impact on senior management's ability to provide effective oversight and strategic direction for all key functions within the company, which could impact our future business, operating results and financial condition.
we are the subject of various legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.
we are involved in various litigation matters, including in some cases class-action and patent infringement litigation. if we are unsuccessful in our defense in the litigation matters, we may be forced to pay damages and/or change our business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or unfavorable future tax law changes could adversely affect our tax expense.
our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal, state, local and international taxing authorities. an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense, and could negatively impact our effective tax rate, financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the current and/or future periods. unfavorable future tax law changes could also result in these negative impacts.
risks related to business combinations and ventures we have a substantial investment in our brazilian venture and obtain significant revenue through that venture that would be lost and result in significant termination costs if our venture partner were to terminate the agreement.
revenue attributable to our brazilian venture partner, banco bradesco, accounted for $277.4 million in 2014. the contract that we have with our brazilian venture partner allows for the termination or partial termination of the contract at any point during the 10-year term, which ends september 30, 2020. this risk of contract termination is reduced by guaranteed performance targets and minimum payments that would be triggered upon the event of an early termination. these payments
16
have been established based on fis' expected rate of return for the contract over a 10-year period. the required payments and buyouts decline each year and are further reduced by returns in excess of the expected returns for the contract and reduce the overall barrier to exiting the venture. if our partner were to exit the agreement, this could have a significant impact on our future revenue and growth. for further detail on our brazilian venture see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
additionally, we employ approximately 10,000 employees in brazil who would have the ability to file labor claims if their employment is terminated. if our brazilian venture partner were to terminate the agreement, we, and they, may be subject to labor claims filed by employees of the brazilian venture. these claims, if realized, could result in a significant cost and impact to our earnings.
we have substantial investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions, and a severe or extended economic downturn could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring write-downs that would reduce our operating income.
as of december 31, 2014, goodwill aggregated to $8,877.6 million, or 61.1% of total assets, and other indefinite lived intangible assets aggregated to $82.3 million, or 0.6% of total assets. current accounting rules require goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets to be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, and negative industry or economic trends. the results of our 2014 annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill indicated that the fair values of the company's reporting units were in excess of the carrying values of those reporting units, and thus no goodwill impairment existed as of december 31, 2014. likewise, the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets was also in excess of the carrying value of those assets as of december 31, 2014. however, if worldwide or united states economic conditions decline significantly with negative impacts to bank spending and consumer behavior, or if other business or market changes impact our outlook, the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we may be required to record an impairment charge, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
as of december 31, 2014, intangible assets with finite useful lives aggregated to $1,185.7 million, or 8.2% of total assets. current accounting rules require intangible assets with finite useful lives to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, and negative industry or economic trends.
we will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets as well as our market capitalization and the impact of any economic downturn on our business to determine if there is an impairment in future periods.
risks related to our indebtedness losses, consolidations and failures in the financial services industry may impact our ability to borrow funds or the ability of our lenders to fulfill their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements.
some financial institutions continue to be challenged by negative operating results. in certain cases, these negative operating results have led to financial institution failures and/or consolidations. as a result, lenders may become insolvent, which could in turn make it more difficult or impossible for lenders to perform their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or for us to borrow under our revolving loan, obtain financing on favorable terms, or obtain financing or interest rate swap agreements at all. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a financial institution fails to fulfill its obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or we are unable to draw funds under our revolving loan or obtain other cost-effective financing.
our existing debt levels and future levels under existing facilities and debt service requirements may adversely affect our financial condition or operational flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness.
as of december 31, 2014, we had total debt of approximately $5,067.7 million. this level of debt could have adverse consequences for our business, financial condition, operating results and operational flexibility, including the following: (i) the debt level may cause us to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes; (ii) our debt level may limit operational flexibility and our ability to pursue business opportunities and
17
implement certain business strategies; (iii) some of our debt has a variable rate of interest, which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates; (iv) we have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors or potential competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions, including increased competition and vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (v) there are significant maturities on our debt that we may not be able to fulfill or that may be refinanced at higher rates; and (vi) if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding debt or fail to comply with the financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes, or our credit facility, an event of default could result that could cause all of our debt to become due and payable.
the covenants relating to our notes and the fis credit agreement are limited and do not prohibit us from incurring additional debt or taking other actions that could exacerbate the risks described in the preceding risk factor or otherwise negatively impact holders of our notes.
we may be able to incur substantially more debt in the future. although the indenture governing certain of our notes and the agreements governing the fis credit agreement (as both are defined in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements) each contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately $2,204.2 million of borrowing capacity available under our existing fis credit agreement. to the extent new debt is added to our current levels, the risks described above could substantially increase.

overview fis is a leading global provider of banking and payments technology solutions, and consulting and outsourcing solutions. with a long history deeply rooted in the financial services industry and banking and payment technology solutions, fis delivers services to more than 14,000 institutions in over 100 countries. headquartered in jacksonville, florida, fis employs approximately 40,000 people worldwide and holds leadership positions in payment processing and banking solutions, providing software, services and outsourcing of the technology that drives financial institutions. through our capco brand, we deliver globally a wide range of information technology consulting and transformational services to financial institutions. fis is a member of the fortune 500 u.s. and of standard and poor's (s&p) 500 index.
business trends and conditions our revenue is primarily derived from a combination of recurring technology and processing services, consulting and professional services and software license fees. the majority of our revenue has historically been recurring, provided under multi-year contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream. these services, in general, are considered critical to our clients' operations. a significant portion of these recurring revenues is derived from transaction processing fees that fluctuate with the level of deposit accounts and card transactions associated with consumer and commercial activity. consulting and professional services revenues are typically non-recurring, and sales of software licenses are less predictable, a portion of which can be regarded as discretionary spending by our clients.
a continued trend in the financial services industry from which we are benefiting is the migration by many financial institutions to outsourced integrated technology solutions to improve their profitability and rapidly address regulatory challenges. as a provider of outsourcing solutions, we benefit from multi-year recurring revenue streams, which help moderate the effects of year-to-year economic changes on our results of operations. we believe our integrated solutions and outsourced services are targeted and well positioned to address this outsourcing trend across the markets we serve.
consulting services revenue grew at an increased pace in 2014, and we believe this trend will continue in 2015. the current market pressures in the financial services industry are driving demand for our consulting and professional services as many financial institutions seek to transform their businesses to significantly reduce their cost base, innovate, and comply with increased regulatory oversight with regard to information technology and related processes. capco provides strategic consulting service capabilities to respond to these market needs and has established itself as a leading global consultancy focused on transformation strategy and execution. our gross margin percentage will decline if consulting and professional services revenue grows disproportionately to our processing and service revenue, which generally delivers a higher gross margin. in addition, as consulting and professional services revenue grow as a portion of our overall revenue, we likely will have a lower overall percentage of recurring revenue as these services are generally non-recurring.
in 2014, we targeted a market opportunity in large global financial institutions where we coupled our strategic consulting and transformation services with outsourced technology, services and solutions to help them achieve their business goals. we made significant, incremental investments in management, sales and account management resources in 2014 to address this opportunity. we believe this market opportunity remains attractive as these large institutions address the challenges they face, thereby driving demand for our consulting and professional services. additionally, we believe these large global institutions are likely to increase technology spending to meet competitive pressures after a slowdown during the recent financial crisis years. we expect to sustain our 2014 investment in management, sales and account management resources to pursue this market opportunity.
consumer preference continues to shift from traditional branch banking services to faster on-demand banking solutions and our clients seek to provide a single integrated banking experience through their branch, mobile, internet and voice banking channels. we are focused on enabling our clients to deliver this experience to their customers through our integrated solutions
25
and services. we continue to innovate and invest in these integrated solutions and services to assist clients as they address this market demand.
we continue to see demand for innovative solutions in the payments market that will deliver faster, more convenient payment solutions in mobile channels, internet applications and cards. we believe mobile payments will grow and partially replace existing payment tender volumes over time as consumers and merchants embrace the convenience, incremental services and benefits. mobile payment volume is growing significantly but does not yet represent a meaningful amount of the payments market. additionally, new formidable non-traditional payments competitors, such as apple, paypal, and large merchants, are investing in and innovating mobile payment technologies to address the emerging market opportunity, and it is unclear the extent to which particular technologies or services will succeed. we believe the growth of mobile payments continues to present both an opportunity and a risk to us as the market develops. although we cannot predict which mobile payment technologies or solution will be successful, we cautiously believe our client relationships, payments infrastructure and experience, adapted solutions and emerging solutions are well positioned to maintain or grow our clients' existing payment volumes, which is our focus.
high profile north american merchant payment card information security breaches have pushed the payment card industry towards emv integrated circuit cards as financial institutions, card networks and merchants seek to improve information security and reduce fraud costs. we have invested in our card management solutions and card manufacturing and processing capabilities to accommodate emv integrated circuit cards so we can guide our clients through this anticipated technology transition, sustain and grow our card driven businesses. we believe the trend to migrate to emv cards will accelerate in 2015 and we continue to invest to address market demand.
the use of checks continues to decline as a percentage of total payments, which negatively impacts our check warranty and item-processing businesses, and we expect this trend to continue. in 2014, we observed a modest deceleration in our check volume decline and to date have been able to successfully mitigate the majority of the impacts of this decline through cost and fraud efficiency actions and new market solutions, which remain our continued focus.
we anticipate consolidation within the banking industry will continue, primarily in the form of merger and acquisition activity, which we believe as a whole is detrimental to our business. however, consolidation resulting from specific merger and acquisition transactions may be beneficial or detrimental to our business. when consolidations of financial institutions occur, merger partners often operate systems licensed from competing service providers. the newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform. when a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation, we may benefit by their expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. conversely, we may lose market share if we are providing services to both entities, or we are not the merging parties' provider of core or payment processing, or if a client of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation may have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide. we seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company.
notwithstanding challenging global economic conditions, our international business continued to experience growth across all major regions on a constant currency basis during the year ended december 31, 2014, including latin america, europe and asia. we expect this growth trend to continue as the result of continued growth in our consulting and professional services, new, large-scale outsourcing clients and the opportunities we see for similar arrangements. demand for our solutions will also be driven in developing countries by government-led financial inclusion policies aimed to reduce the unbanked population and by growth in the middle classes in these markets driving the need for more sophisticated banking solutions. the majority of our european revenue is generated by clients in the united kingdom, france and germany.
information security globally, attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication. this is a trend we expect will continue. such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities. the objectives of these attacks include, among other things, gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud, disrupt operations, cause denial of service events, corrupt data, and steal non-public information. fis is not immune to such attacks. as part of our business, we electronically receive, process, store and transmit a wide range of confidential information, including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data. we also operate payment, cash access and prepaid card systems. fis, like any large financial technology service provider, is subject to attempted cyber-attacks on a regular basis. a successful cyber-attack on an fis system that resulted in sensitive information being compromised, fraud losses or other adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on the company.
26
as a multi-regional data processing servicer (mdps), fis continues to be examined by and have regular interaction with the federal agencies that regulate financial institutions. these regulators have the authority to take actions they deem necessary to protect the safety and soundness of the financial institutions they regulate. such actions, if taken, could have a material adverse impact on our business. fis regularly reports to its regulators and to its clients regarding the company's continual efforts to enhance its information security and risk management technology, programs and procedures. in late april 2014, the federal agencies that provide regulatory oversight for fis issued a confidential report related to their examination of our information security, risk management and internal audit functions between october 2012 and october 2013. we responded to the report and described the actions that we have taken, as well as ongoing efforts underway to address specific findings. the regulatory agencies distributed the report, and a cover letter, to a subset of our regulated clients beginning in may 2014. this prompted inquiries from clients, which, to the extent permitted by federal regulation, fis has addressed on an individual basis. while individual clients and prospects have expressed concern over the report, we do not believe that it has had a material effect on the overall sales closures in 2014 or our sales pipeline; however, we continue to monitor sales activity and any potential impact on future periods. we are unable to predict with certainty what, if any, communications or actions our regulators will have or take with our regulated financial institution clients with respect to our risk management and information security. we are also unable to predict the effect that any such communications or actions may have on our business.
fis remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect its clients and its information systems. this includes both capital expenditures and operating expense on hardware, software, personnel and consulting services. we also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients.
critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements. these policies require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. actual amounts could differ from those estimates. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition the company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing, credit and debit card processing services, other payment processing services, professional services, software licensing and software related services. revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable. we are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same client. these situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition. in making this determination, we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts, whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated. our individual contracts also frequently include multiple elements. we must apply judgment in these circumstances in determining whether individual elements can be considered separate units of accounting or should instead be accounted for in combination with other deliverables. judgment is also required in ascribing fair value to each deliverable for purposes of allocating consideration. due to the large number, broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to, the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position. however, the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of clients could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position. additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
allowance for doubtful accounts the company analyzes trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts, client creditworthiness, current economic trends, changes in client payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. any change in the assumptions used may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs.
27
provision for check guarantee losses in our check guarantee business, if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant client is dishonored by the check writer's bank, we reimburse our merchant client for the check's face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer. loss provisions and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future. such factors include the general economy, the overall industry mix of our client volumes, statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our client volumes and the quality of returned checks. the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates.
historically, our estimation processes have proved to be materially accurate; however, our projections of probable check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain and as a result, we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items. changes in economic conditions, the risk characteristics and composition of our clients, and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts. we recorded check guarantee losses, net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees, of $57.2 million, $57.3 million and $54.7 million, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. a ten percent difference in our estimated check guarantee loss provisions net of estimated recoveries as of december 31, 2014, would have impacted 2014 net earnings by less than $2.0 million, after-tax.
computer software computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations, purchased software and capitalized software development costs. purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straight-line or accelerated methods over its estimated useful life.
the capitalization of software development costs is governed by fasb asc subtopic 985-20 if the software is to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed, or by fasb asc subtopic 350-40 if the software is for internal use. after the technological feasibility of the software has been established (for software to be marketed), or at the beginning of application development (for internal-use software), software development costs, which include primarily salaries and related payroll costs and costs of independent contractors incurred during development, are capitalized. research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility (for software to be marketed), or prior to application development (for internal-use software), are expensed as incurred. software development costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis commencing on the date of general release of the products (for software to be marketed) or the date placed in service (for internal-use software). software development costs for software to be marketed are amortized using the greater of (1) the straight-line method over its estimated useful life, which ranges from three to 10 years, or (2) the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues over its useful life.
in determining useful lives, management considers historical results and technological trends that may influence the estimate. useful lives for all computer software range from three to 10 years. we also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset (for software to be marketed). there are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software. while we have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates, our results of operations could be subject to such changes in the future.
goodwill and other intangible assets we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. the estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment. we generally engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations. we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our finite-lived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. additionally, we review our indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine if there is any change in circumstances that may indicate the asset's useful life is no longer indefinite.
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized, but shall be tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment. in 2011, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2011-08 ("asu 2011-08"), testing goodwill for impairment. the revised standard allows an entity first
28
to assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, referred to in the guidance as "step zero." if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent), the "step one" quantitative assessment must be performed for that reporting unit. asu 2011-08 provided examples of events and circumstances that should be considered in performing the "step zero" qualitative assessment, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, events affecting a reporting unit or the entity as a whole and a sustained decrease in share price.
we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter using a september 30th measurement date unless circumstances require a more frequent measurement. for 2014 and 2013, we began our assessment with the step zero qualitative analysis because there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units in the 2012 step one analysis. in performing the step zero qualitative analysis for each of 2014 and 2013, examining those factors most likely to affect our valuations, we concluded that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying amounts. consequently, we did not perform a step one quantitative analysis in 2014 or 2013.
for 2012, primarily for the purpose of validating our valuation assumptions, we elected to proceed directly to the step one quantitative analysis rather than perform the step zero qualitative assessment. in applying the quantitative analysis, we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques, principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach. the income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows, while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets, goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required. based upon the results of this test, there were no indications of impairment for any of our reporting units for 2012.
we also estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value annually. fasb accounting standards update no. 2012-02 ("asu 2012-02") modified the former requirement to perform an annual quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. similar to the asu 2011-08 guidance for goodwill, it allows an organization to first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired.
for 2014 and 2013, we began our assessment of indefinite lived intangibles with the step zero qualitative analysis because there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2012. based upon the results of this test, there were no indications of impairment, except for one trademark with nominal value in 2013. for 2012, we proceeded directly to a quantitative analysis, using a form of income approach valuation known as the relief-from-royalty method. our tests did not result in the impairment of any of our intangible assets for 2012.
determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions.
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and financial reporting purposes. these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheets. we must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, establish a valuation allowance. to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period, we must reflect this increase or decrease as an expense or benefit within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve. further, changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual pre-tax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period. we also receive periodic assessments from taxing authorities challenging our positions that must be taken into consideration in determining our tax reserves. resolving these assessments, which may or may not result in additional taxes due, may also require an extended period of time. we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we adequately account for any known tax contingencies. we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable. however, final determination of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities
29
and historical income tax provisions. the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period that a determination is made.
related party transactions we are a party to certain historical related party agreements as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this annual report.
factors affecting comparability our consolidated financial statements included in this report that present our financial condition and operating results reflect the following significant transactions:
•   we have engaged in share repurchase programs throughout all periods presented. in 2014, we repurchased a total of 8.7 million shares for $475.5 million; in 2013, we repurchased a total of 10.7 million shares for $475.9 million; and in 2012, we repurchased a total of 14.0 million shares for $451.4 million.
as a result of the above transactions, earnings per share in the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements may not be directly comparable.

processing and services revenues processing and services revenues totaled $6,413.8 million, $6,063.4 million and $5,795.8 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase in revenue during 2014 of $350.4 million, or 5.8%, as compared to 2013, is primarily attributable to increased demand for implementation and consulting services, incremental revenues from 2013 and 2014 acquisitions of $83.2 million and growth from our international operations resulting from our expanded presence across europe and asia. the 2014 period included $37.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact resulting from a stronger u.s. dollar as compared to 2013. the increase in revenue during 2013 of $267.6 million, or 4.6%, as compared to 2012, is primarily attributable to transaction growth and demand for professional and consulting services, higher termination fees, incremental revenues from 2013 and 2012 acquisitions of $55.7 million and increased processing volumes. the 2013 period included $49.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact resulting from a stronger u.s. dollar as compared to 2012.

cost of revenues and gross profit cost of revenues totaled $4,332.7 million, $4,092.7 million and $3,956.2 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, resulting in gross profit of $2,081.1 million, $1,970.7 million and $1,839.6 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. gross profit as a percentage of revenues ("gross margin") was 32.4%, 32.5% and 31.7% in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase in gross profit during 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above. the gross margin for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily reflects the impact of revenue mix, as higher margin processing revenue drove margin expansion that was offset by an increase in lower margin consulting revenue and lower termination fees in 2014. the increase in gross profit during 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above. the increase in gross margin for 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily reflects the impact of a more favorable revenue mix, as higher margin processing revenue and termination fees drove margin expansion that was partially offset by increases in lower margin consulting revenue and $16.1 million of the capco acquisition related adjustments described in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $810.5 million, $907.8 million and $763.3 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the 2014 decrease of $97.3 million as compared to 2013 was primarily due to the impact of charges recorded in the 2013 period discussed below, partially offset by 2014 one-time transaction costs, including integration activities related to recent acquisitions and other severance costs. the 2013 increase of $144.5 million as compared to 2012 was primarily due to charges of $131.1 million for the capco acquisition related adjustments described in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. the 2013 period also included higher sales and marketing expense, an increase in health-care benefit expense and increased investment in security and risk management.
operating income operating income totaled $1,270.6 million, $1,062.9 million and $1,076.3 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. operating income as a percentage of revenue ("operating margin") was 19.8%, 17.5% and 18.6% for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the annual changes in operating income and operating margin resulted from the revenue and cost variances addressed above.
total other income (expense)
total other income (expense) was $(217.2) million, $(239.4) million and $(248.0) million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. interest expense is a large component of total other income (expense), net. interest expense totaled $172.8 million, $198.6 million and $231.3 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the decrease of $25.8 million in interest expense in 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily due to lower borrowing rates as the result of the debt refinancing activity undertaken during 2014 and 2013. other income (expense) net for 2014 includes a loss of $16.2 on a foreign currency forward contract associated with the euro-based purchase price for our clear2pay acquisition, the write-off of certain previously capitalized debt issuance costs of $7.0 million and the payment of a $29.5 million bond premium associated with the early redemption of certain debt. the decrease of $32.7 million in interest expense in 2013 as compared to 2012 resulted from lower borrowing rates as the result of debt refinancing. in addition to interest expense, the 2013 period also includes: (a) charges of $(16.1) million for the write-off of certain previously capitalized debt issuance costs and transaction expenses related to refinancing activities; (b) a net charge of $(45.3) million representing the $51.6 million premium incurred for the early redemption of certain debt offset by the premium reflected in the carrying value of that debt; and (c) a $9.2 million gain resulting from the purchase of the remaining shares of mfoundry, representing the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the minority-interest investment previously held.
provision for income taxes income tax expense from continuing operations totaled $335.1 million, $308.9 million and $270.1 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. this resulted in an effective tax rate on continuing operations of 31.8%, 37.5% and 32.6% for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. during 2014, we realized tax benefits related to certain acquired net operating loss carryovers. this and certain favorable audit resolutions in 2014 contributed to the rate differential for the 2014 period. in 2013, capco acquisition related contingent consideration that was recorded in 2013 was not deductible for tax purposes and, therefore, had an unfavorable impact on the 2013 effective tax rate, which otherwise would have been comparable to 2012.

earnings (loss) from discontinued operations during 2014, 2013 and 2012, certain operations are classified as discontinued, as discussed in note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. reporting for discontinued operations classifies revenues and expenses as one line item, net of tax, in the consolidated statements of earnings. the table below outlines the components of discontinued operations for 2014, 2013 and 2012, net of tax (in millions):

during the second quarter of 2014, the company committed to a plan to sell our business operation that provides ecas core banking software solutions to small financial institutions in china because it did not align with our strategic plans. this line of business was previously included in the isg segment.
on january 1, 2010, fis sold certain assets and liabilities constituting our clearpar automated syndicated loan trade settlement business. terms of the sale included an initial cash payment of $71.5 million at closing, with the potential for an additional contingent earn-out payment calculated as a function of the business' 2012 operating results. in may 2013, we recorded in discontinued operations a gain of $26.8 million ($16.7 million, net of tax) upon final determination and receipt of the earn-out payment.
participacoes, our former item processing and remittance services business in brazil, had no revenue in 2014, 2013 and 2012. participacoes had expenses of $10.1 million, $23.1 million and $47.5 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. participacoes' processing volume was transitioned to other vendors or back to its clients during the second quarter of 2011. as a result of the dismissal of employees related to the shut-down activities completed in 2011, the 2014, 2013 and 2012 periods included charges of $5.1 million, $15.7 million and $39.1 million, respectively, to settle claims or increase our provision for potential labor claims. the shut-down activities involved the transfer and termination of approximately 2,600 employees. as of december 31, 2014, there are approximately 790 active labor claims. former employees generally had up to two years from the date of termination to file labor claims. consequently, we have continued exposure on these active claims, which were not transferred with other assets and liabilities in the disposal. any changes in the estimated liability related to these labor claims will be recorded as discontinued operations.
in 2004, proservvi empreendimentos e servicios, ltda., the predecessor to fidelity national servicos de tratamento de documentos e informatica ltda. ("servicos"), a subsidiary of participacoes, acquired certain assets and employees and leased certain facilities from the transpev group ("transpev") in brazil. transpev's remaining assets were later acquired by prosegur, an unrelated third party. when transpev discontinued its operations after the asset sale to prosegur, it had unpaid federal taxes and social contributions owing to the brazilian tax authorities. the brazilian tax authorities brought a claim against transpev and beginning in 2012 brought claims against prosegur and servicos on the grounds that that prosegur and servicos were successors in interest to transpev.
to date, the brazilian tax authorities filed four claims against servicos asserting potential tax liabilities of approximately $8.0 million. there are potentially 26 additional claims against prosegur for which servicos is named as a co-defendant or may be named, but for which servicos has not yet been served. these additional claims amount to approximately $60.0 million making the total potential exposure for all 30 claims approximately $68.0 million. while a liability for these 30 total claims is possible, we do not believe it is probable or reasonably estimable and therefore have not accrued for any of these claims.
net (earnings) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest net (earnings) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest predominantly relates to the joint venture in brazil (see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements) and totaled $(27.8) million, $(24.6) million and $(19.9) million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

earnings from continuing operations, net of tax, attributable to fis common stockholders earnings from continuing operations, net of tax, attributable to fis common stockholders totaled $690.5 million, $490.0 million and $538.3 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, or $2.39, $1.67 and $1.81 per diluted share, respectively, due to the factors described above coupled with the impact of our share repurchase initiatives.

operating income for isg totaled $236.0 million, $196.3 million and $199.3 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. operating margin was 16.7%, 15.5% and 17.1% for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase in operating income during 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above. the increase in operating margin for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily results from the 2013 charges discussed below, partially offset by a change in revenue mix. the 2013 period included $22.0 million of the charge to increase the capco acquisition related liabilities discussed in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. the 2013 period also included $9.1 million for severance and other charges related to cost management initiatives in certain international markets. excluding the aforementioned charges, operating income for 2013 increased primarily from the revenue growth noted above and the operating margin benefited from increased scale and improved operating efficiencies across a number of major geographies.
corporate and other the corporate and other segment results consist of selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and intangible asset amortization not otherwise allocated to the reportable segments. corporate and other expenses were $745.0 million, $873.6 million and $720.4 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the overall corporate and other decrease of $128.6 million for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to the 2013 charges discussed below and our continued commitment to productivity improvements and cost management. the overall corporate and other increase of $153.2 million for 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to charges of $129.1 million for the capco contingent consideration adjustments in 2013 described in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. the 2013 period also included higher sales and marketing expense, an increase in health-care benefit expense and increased investment in security and risk management.
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements our ongoing cash requirements include operating expenses, income taxes, mandatory debt service payments, capital expenditures, stockholder dividends, working capital and timing differences in settlement-related assets and liabilities, and may include discretionary debt service, share repurchases and business acquisitions. our cash requirements also include payments for capco's contingent consideration earn-out and for labor claims related to fis' former item processing and remittance operations in brazil (see notes 6 and 3, respectively, in the notes to consolidated financial statements). our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings, including the capacity under our revolving loan described in note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
as of december 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $492.8 million and debt of $5,067.7 million, including the current portion. of the $492.8 million cash and cash equivalents, approximately $310.5 million is held by our foreign entities and would generally be subject to u.s. income taxation upon repatriation to the u.s. the majority of our domestic cash and cash equivalents represents net deposits-in-transit at the balance sheet dates and relates to daily settlement activity. we expect that cash and cash equivalents plus cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements, capital expenditures and mandatory debt service.

we currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, which we have increased over recent years. on january 30, 2015, the board of directors approved an additional 8% increase to $0.26 per share per quarter beginning with the first quarter of 2015. however, the amount, declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors and depends on, among other things, our investment opportunities, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors that may be considered relevant by our board of directors, including legal and contractual restrictions. additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements. a regular quarterly dividend of $0.26 per common share is payable on march 31, 2015 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on march 17, 2015.
cash flows from operations cash flows from operations were $1,164.9 million, $1,060.3 million and $1,046.7 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively. cash flows from operations increased $104.6 million in 2014 and $13.6 million in 2013. the 2014 increase in cash flows from operations is primarily due to higher net earnings, partially offset by changes in working capital. the 2013 increase in cash flows from operations is primarily due to higher net earnings, the timing of merchant and card transaction settlement activity and other changes in working capital, partially offset by a $51.6 million bond premium payment resulting from the early pay down of our 2017 senior notes in the first half of 2013 and by the $42.0 million payment associated with the capco acquisition liabilities.
capital expenditures and other investing activities our principal capital expenditures are for computer software (purchased and internally developed) and additions to property and equipment. we invested approximately $371.2 million, $336.2 million and $296.1 million in capital expenditures during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. we expect to invest approximately 5.5-6% of 2015 revenue in capital expenditures.
we used $595.2 million, $150.5 million and $63.6 million of cash during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, for acquisitions and other equity investments. see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the more significant items. cash provided by net proceeds from sale of assets in 2012 relates principally to the sale of the healthcare benefit solutions business discussed in note 3.

(2)   amount includes the estimated payment for labor claims related to fis' former item processing and remittance operations in brazil (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), amounts due to the brazilian venture partner and capco contingent consideration payments (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).
fis believes that its existing cash balances, cash flows from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet fis' expected liquidity needs for the operations of its business and expected capital spending for the next 12 months.
off-balance sheet arrangements fis does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting guidance not yet adopted in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)" ("asu
2014-09"). asu 2014-09 amends substantially all authoritative literature for revenue recognition, including industry-specific requirements, and converges the guidance under this topic with that of the international financial reporting standards. the asu implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. the amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. other provisions include ensuring the time value of money is considered in the transaction price and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. the amendments in this asu are effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, and early adoption is prohibited. entities can transition to the standard either with retrospective application to the earlier years presented in their financial statements or with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. we are currently assessing the impact the adoption of asu 2014-09 will have on our financial position and results of operations.

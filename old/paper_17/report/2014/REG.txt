item 1a. risk factors risk factors related to our industry and real estate investments a shift in retail shopping from brick and mortar stores to internet sales may have an adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow.
many retailers operating brick and mortar stores have made internet sales a vital piece of their business. although many of the retailers in our shopping centers either provide services or sell groceries, such that their customer base does not have a tendency toward online shopping, the shift to internet sales may adversely impact our retail tenants' sales causing those retailers to adjust the size or number of retail locations in the future. this shift could adversely impact our occupancy and rental rates, which would impact our revenues and cash flows.
downturns in the retail industry likely will have a direct adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow.
our properties consist primarily of grocery-anchored shopping centers. our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space. the market for retail space could be adversely affected by any of the following:
•   weakness in the national, regional and local economies, which could adversely impact consumer spending and retail sales and in turn tenant demand for space and lead to increased store closings;
•   adverse financial conditions for grocery and retail anchors;
•   continued consolidation in the retail sector;
•   excess amount of retail space in our markets;
•   reduction in the demand by tenants to occupy our shopping centers as a result of reduced consumer demand for certain retail categories;
•   the growth of super-centers and warehouse club retailers, such as those operated by wal-mart and costco, and their adverse effect on traditional grocery chains;
•   the impact of changing energy costs on consumers and its consequential effect on retail spending; and
•   consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the united states.
to the extent that any of these conditions occur, they are likely to impact market rents for retail space, occupancy in the operating portfolios, our ability to sell, acquire or develop properties, and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders.
our revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected if economic or market conditions deteriorate where our properties are geographically concentrated, which may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain our properties.
the economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated greatly influence our financial performance. during the year ended december 31, 2014, our properties in california, florida, and texas accounted for 30.6%, 11.3%, and 10.0%, respectively, of our net operating income from consolidated properties plus our pro-rata share from unconsolidated properties ("pro-rata basis"). our revenues and cash available to pay expenses, maintain our properties, and for distributions to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions, such as supply of or demand for retail space, deteriorate in california, florida, or texas relative to other geographic areas.
our success depends on the success and continued presence of our "anchor" tenants.
anchor tenants occupy large amounts of square footage, pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property. we derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as kroger, publix, and safeway, who accounted for 4.5%, 3.8%, and 2.3%, respectively, of our total annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis, for the year ended december 31, 2014. our net income could be adversely affected by the loss of revenues in the event a significant tenant:
•   becomes bankrupt or insolvent;
•   experiences a downturn in its business;
•   materially defaults on its leases;
•   does not renew its leases as they expire; or
•   renews at lower rental rates.
4
some anchors have the right to vacate and prevent re-tenanting by paying rent for the balance of the lease term. vacated anchor space, including space owned by the anchor, can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenant's customer drawing power. if a significant tenant vacates a property, co-tenancy clauses in select centers may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations. co-tenancy clauses have several variants: they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores; they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration; or more commonly, they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center.
a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop tenants and our net income could be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful.
a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop tenants (those occupying less than 10,000 square feet). smaller shop tenants may be more vulnerable to negative economic conditions as they have more limited resources than larger tenants. such tenants continue to face increasing competition from non-store retailers and growing e-commerce. in addition, some of these retailers may seek to reduce their store sizes as they increasingly rely on alternative distribution channels, including internet sales, and adjust their square footage needs accordingly. the types of smaller shop tenants vary from retail shops to service providers. if we are unable to attract the right type or mix of smaller shop tenants into our centers, our net income could be adversely impacted.
we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy.
although minimum rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and rejects its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all pre-petition amounts owed by that party.
our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges.
our long-lived assets, primarily real estate held for investment, are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. we evaluate whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable. through the evaluation, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated holding periods, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate. these key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results. changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the holding period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the company's financial condition or operating performance. to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.
the fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the traditional discounted cash flow approach. such cash flow projections consider factors, including expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors, and therefore are subject to management judgment. changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value. in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.
these subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income. there can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets. any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our net income in the period in which the charge is taken.
adverse global market and economic conditions could cause us to recognize additional impairment charges or otherwise harm our performance.
we are unable to predict the timing, severity, and length of adverse market and economic conditions. adverse market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay expenses, maintain properties, pay distributions to our stock and unit holders, and refinance debt. during adverse periods, there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation of our properties and investments that could result in a substantial decrease in their value. no
5
assurance can be given that we would be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our properties and investments in the future. our failure to do so would require us to recognize additional impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion, which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock.
unsuccessful development activities or a slowdown in development activities could have a direct impact on our revenues, revenue growth, and/or net income.
we actively pursue development opportunities. development activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay the development process. we may not recover our investment in development projects for which approvals are not received. we incur other risks associated with development activities, including:
•   the risk that we may be unable to lease developments to full occupancy on a timely basis;
•   the risk that occupancy rates and rents of a completed project will not be sufficient to make the project profitable;
•   the risk that development costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project unprofitable;
•   the risk that delays in the development and construction process could increase costs;
•   the risk that we may abandon development opportunities and lose our investment in such opportunities;
•   the risk that the size of our development pipeline will strain the organization's capacity to complete the developments within the targeted timelines and at the expected returns on invested capital;
•   changes in the level of future development and redevelopment activity could have an adverse impact on operating results by reducing the amount of capitalizable internal costs for development projects; and
•   the lack of cash flow during the construction period.
our acquisition activities may not produce the returns that we expect.
our investment strategy includes investing in high-quality shopping centers that are leased to market-dominant grocers, category-leading anchors, specialty retailers, or restaurants located in areas with high barriers to entry and above average household incomes and population densities. the acquisition of properties and/or companies entails risks that include, but are not limited to, the following, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations:
•   properties we acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project, within the time frames we estimate, which may result in the properties' failure to achieve the returns we projected;
•   our pre-acquisition evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment may not detect certain defects or identify necessary repairs until after the property is acquired, which could significantly increase our total acquisition costs or decrease cash flow from the property;
•   our investigation of a company, property or building prior to our acquisition, and any representations we may receive from such seller, may fail to reveal various liabilities, which could reduce the cash flow from the acquisition or increase our acquisition costs;
•   our estimate of the costs to improve, reposition or redevelop a property may prove to be too low, or the time we estimate to complete the improvement, repositioning or redevelopment may be too short, either of which could result in the property failing to achieve the returns we have projected, either temporarily or for a longer time;
•   we may not recover our costs from an unsuccessful acquisition;
•   our acquisition activities may distract our management and generate significant costs; and
•   we may not be able to integrate an acquisition into our existing operations successfully.
we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or re-leasing space.
we derive most of our revenue from rent received from our tenants. we are subject to the risks that, upon expiration or termination of leases, leases for space in our properties may not be renewed, space may not be re-leased, or the terms of renewal or re-lease, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than current lease terms. as a result, our results of operations and our net income could be adversely impacted.
6
we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid.
real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. our inability to respond promptly to unfavorable changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders.
geographic concentration of our properties makes our business vulnerable to natural disasters and severe weather conditions, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and operating results.
a significant portion of our property gross leasable area is located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes, tropical storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, and other natural disasters. as of december 31, 2014, approximately 23.6%, 15.0%, and 10.5% of our property gross leasable area, on a pro-rata basis, was located in california, florida, and texas, respectively. intense weather conditions during the last decade have caused our cost of property insurance to increase significantly. we recognize that the frequency and / or intensity of extreme weather events may continue to increase due to climate change, and as a result, our exposure to these events could increase.  these weather conditions also disrupt our business and the business of our tenants, which could affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of residents to remain in or move to the affected area. therefore, as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties, we face risks, including higher costs, such as uninsured property losses and higher insurance premiums, and disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants.
should we decide in the future to expand into new markets, we may not be successful, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
if opportunities arise, we may explore acquisitions of properties in new markets. each of the risks applicable to our ability to acquire and integrate successfully and operate properties in our current markets is also applicable in new markets. in addition, we may not possess the same level of familiarity with the dynamics and market conditions of the new markets we may enter, which could adversely affect the results of our expansion into those markets, and we may be unable to achieve our desired return on our investments in new markets. if we are unsuccessful in expanding into new markets, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties could subject us to loss of capital or revenue on those properties.
we carry comprehensive liability, fire, flood, extended coverage, rental loss, and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. we believe that the insurance carried on our properties is adequate and consistent with industry standards. there are, however, some types of losses, such as losses from hurricanes, terrorism, wars or earthquakes, for which the insurance levels carried may not be sufficient to fully cover catastrophic losses impacting multiple properties. in addition, tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons or damage to personal or real property, on or off the premises, due to activities conducted by tenants or their agents on the properties (including without limitation any environmental contamination), and at the tenant's expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies. however, our tenants may not properly maintain their insurance policies or have the ability to pay the deductibles associated with such policies. should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in, and anticipated revenue from, such properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, as well as our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.
loss of our key personnel could adversely affect our business and operations.
we depend on the efforts of our key executive personnel. although we believe qualified replacements could be found for our key executives, the loss of their services could adversely affect our business and operations.
7
we face competition from numerous sources, including other reits and other real estate owners.
the ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented. we face competition from other reits and well capitalized institutional investors, as well as from numerous small owners in the acquisition, ownership, and leasing of shopping centers. we also compete to develop shopping centers with other reits engaged in development activities as well as with local, regional, and national real estate developers. this competition may:
•reduce the number of properties available for acquisition or development;
•increase the cost of properties available for acquisition or development;
•hinder our ability to attract and retain tenants, leading to increased vacancy rates and/or reduced rents; and
•adversely affect our ability to minimize our expenses of operation.
if we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets, our cash flow, and therefore distributions to stock and unit holders, may be adversely affected.
costs of environmental remediation could reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders.
under various federal, state and local laws, an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property. these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. the cost of any required remediation could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner or the responsible party. the presence of, or the failure to properly remediate, hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a contaminated property or to use the property as collateral for a loan. any of these developments could reduce cash flow and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.
compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures.
all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act ("ada"), which generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. compliance with ada requirements could require removal of access barriers, and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the u.s. government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both. while the tenants to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions, and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance, if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected. in addition, we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties. we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with these requirements, and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders.
if we do not maintain the security of tenant-related information, we could incur substantial costs and become subject to litigation.
we have implemented an online payment system where we receive certain information about our tenants that depends upon secure transmissions of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. a compromise of our security systems that results in information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. in addition, a security breach could require us to expend significant resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations.
we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business and disruptions in both our primary and secondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to run our business.
although we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems. our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our employees. if our computer systems and our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. any
8
material interruption in both of our computer systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
risk factors related to our co-investment partnerships and acquisition structure we do not have voting control over our joint venture investments, so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued.
we have invested substantial capital as a partner in a number of joint venture investments for the acquisition or development of properties. these investments involve risks not present in a wholly-owned project as we do not have voting control over the ventures, although we do have approval rights over major decisions. the other partner may (i) have interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals or (ii) otherwise impede our objectives. the other partner also may become insolvent or bankrupt. these factors could limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates.
the termination of our co-investment partnerships could adversely affect our cash flow, operating results, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.
if co-investment partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason, we would lose the asset and property management fees from these co-investment partnerships, which could adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders.
risk factors related to funding strategies and capital structure higher market capitalization rates for our properties could adversely impact our ability to sell properties and fund developments and acquisitions, and could dilute earnings.
as part of our funding strategy, we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards or those with a limited future growth profile. these sales proceeds are used to fund the construction of new developments, redevelopments and acquisitions. an increase in market capitalization rates could cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale, which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated. in order to meet the cash requirements of our development program, we may be required to sell more properties than initially planned, which could have a negative impact on our earnings.
we depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all.
to qualify as a reit, the parent company must, among other things, distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90% of its reit taxable income (excluding any net capital gains). because of these distribution requirements, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs with income from operations. we therefore will have to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of things, including the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings. our access to debt depends on our credit rating, the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets.  in addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us, we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their pro rata share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our joint ventures are eligible to refinance.
in addition, our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing, such as a prohibition on negative pledge agreements. additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders' interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage.
without access to external sources of capital, we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales. our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate.  if we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales, we may be forced to reduce the amount of, or eliminate altogether, our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business.
9
our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition.
our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance, which to a certain extent is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. in addition, we do not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due. if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced (i) to dispose of properties, which might result in losses, or (ii) to obtain financing at unfavorable terms, either of which could reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders. if we cannot make required mortgage payments, the mortgagee could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage.
covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition.
our unsecured notes, unsecured term loan, and unsecured line of credit contain customary covenants, including compliance with financial ratios, such as ratio of total debt to gross asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio. fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") divided by the sum of interest expense and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders. our debt arrangements also restrict our ability to enter into a transaction that would result in a change of control. these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our acquisition activities. moreover, if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements, and do not cure the breach within the applicable cure period, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately, even in the absence of a payment default. many of our debt arrangements, including our unsecured notes, unsecured term loan, and unsecured line of credit are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations. as a result, any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations, and the market value of our stock.
increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations.
although a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facilities. increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates. in addition, increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures, to the extent we have not hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates. this would reduce our future earnings and cash flows, which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders.
we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax-deferred contribution transactions, which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell such assets.
we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in our operating partnership, which may result in stockholder dilution. this acquisition structure may have the effect of, among other things, reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and may require that we agree to protect the contributors' ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and/or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. these restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions.
hedging activity may expose us to risks, including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate, which could adversely affect us.
from time to time, we manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements that involve risk, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, and that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes. there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will qualify for hedge accounting or that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations. should we desire to terminate a hedging agreement, there could be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our obligations under the hedging agreement. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.
10
risk factors related to the market price for our debt and equity securities changes in economic and market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our securities.
the market price of our debt and equity securities may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, many of which are out of our control, including:
•   actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;
•   changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates;
•   publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry in general and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other reit's;
•   the ability of our tenants to pay rent and meet their other obligations to us under current lease terms and our ability to re-lease space as leases expire;
•   increases in market interest rates that drive purchasers of our stock to demand a higher dividend yield;
•   changes in market valuations of similar companies;
•   adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;
•   any future issuances of equity securities;
•   additions or departures of key management personnel;
•   strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;
•   actions by institutional stockholders;
•   changes in our dividend payments;
•   speculation in the press or investment community; and
•   general market and economic conditions.
these factors may cause the market price of our securities to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects. it is impossible to ensure that the market price of our securities, including our common stock, will not fall in the future. a decrease in the market price of our common stock could reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets. selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders.
we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates.
our ability to continue to pay dividends at historical rates or to increase our dividend rate will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the following:
•   our financial condition and results of future operations;
•   the terms of our loan covenants; and
•   our ability to acquire, finance, develop or redevelop and lease additional properties at attractive rates.
if we do not maintain or periodically increase the dividend on our common stock, it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and other securities.
changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial results.
the financial accounting standards board ("fasb"), in conjunction with the sec, has several key projects on their agenda that could impact how we currently account for our material transactions, including lease accounting and other convergence projects with the international accounting standards board. at this time, we are unable to predict with certainty which, if any, proposals may be passed or what level of impact any such proposal could have on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements, our results of operations and our financial ratios required by our debt covenants.
risk factors related to federal income tax laws if the parent company fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.
we believe that the parent company qualifies for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit. if the parent company continues to qualify as a reit, it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. many reit requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. the determination that the parent company is a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances, some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which
11
involve questions of interpretation. for example, to qualify as a reit, at least 95% of our gross income must come from specific passive sources, like rent, that are itemized in the reit tax laws. there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service ("irs") or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the reit requirements. we are also required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our reit taxable income, excluding capital gains. the fact that we hold many of our assets through co-investment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements. furthermore, congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings, that make it more difficult, or impossible, for the parent company to remain qualified as a reit.
also, unless the irs granted relief under certain statutory provisions, the parent company would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year it first failed to qualify. if the parent company failed to qualify as a reit (currently and/or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we would have to pay significant income taxes, reducing cash available to pay dividends, which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. in addition, we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders. although we believe that the parent company qualifies as a reit, we cannot assure you that the parent company will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes.
even if the parent company qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes, we are required to pay certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. for example, if we have net income from "prohibited transactions," that income will be subject to a 100% tax. in general, prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale. while we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years, we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions, but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise.
dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates.
subject to limited exceptions, dividends paid by reits (other than distributions designated as capital gain dividends or returns of capital) are not eligible for reduced rates for qualified dividends paid by "c" corporations and are taxable at ordinary income tax rates. the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-reit corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of reits, including the shares of our capital stock.
foreign stockholders may be subject to u.s. federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a "domestically controlled" reit.
a foreign person disposing of a u.s. real property interest, including shares of a u.s. corporation whose assets consist principally of u.s. real property interests is generally subject to u.s. federal income tax on any gain recognized on the disposition. this tax does not apply, however, to the disposition of stock in a reit if the reit is "domestically controlled." in general, we will be a domestically controlled reit if at all times during the five-year period ending on the applicable stockholder's disposition of our stock, less than 50% in value of our stock was held directly or indirectly by non-u.s. persons. if we were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled reit, gain recognized by a foreign stockholder on a disposition of our common stock would be subject to u.s. federal income tax unless our common stock was traded on an established securities market and the foreign stockholder did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock.
complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.
the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge our liabilities. generally, income from a hedging transaction we enter into either to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings incurred or to be incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets, or to manage the risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain (or any property which generates such income or gain) that constitutes "qualifying income" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests applicable to reits, does not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, provided that we properly identify the hedging transaction pursuant to the applicable sections of the code and treasury regulations. to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, or fail to make the proper tax identifications, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests. as a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of otherwise advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable reit subsidiary, or trs. the use of a trs could increase the cost of our hedging activities (because our trs would be subject to tax on income or gain resulting from hedges entered into by it) or expose us to greater risks than we would otherwise want to bear. in addition, net losses in a trs will generally not provide any tax benefit except for being carried forward for use against future taxable income in the trs.

risk factors related to our ownership limitations and the florida business corporation act restrictions on the ownership of the parent company's capital stock to preserve its reit status could delay or prevent a change in control.
ownership of more than 7% by value of our outstanding capital stock is prohibited, with certain exceptions, by the parent company's articles of incorporation, for the purpose of maintaining its qualification as a reit. this 7% limitation may discourage a change in control and may also (i) deter tender offers for our capital stock, which offers may be attractive to our stockholders, or (ii) limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7% of our outstanding capital stock or to affect a change in control.
the issuance of the parent company's capital stock could delay or prevent a change in control.
the parent company's articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 10,000,000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued. the issuance of preferred stock or special common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. the provisions of the florida business corporation act regarding control share acquisitions and affiliated transactions could also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from voting the common stock it acquires or consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview regency centers corporation began its operations as a reit in 1993 and is the managing general partner of regency centers, l.p. all of our operating, investing, and financing activities are performed through the operating partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and through its co-investment partnerships. as of december 31, 2014, the parent company owned approximately 99.8% of the outstanding common partnership units of the operating partnership.
as of december 31, 2014, we directly owned 202 consolidated properties located in 21 states representing 23.2 million square feet of gla. through co-investment partnerships, we own partial ownership interests in 120 unconsolidated properties located in 23 states and the district of columbia representing 15.0 million square feet of gla.
we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores, major retail anchors, restaurants, side-shop retailers, and service providers, as well as ground leasing or selling out-parcels to these same types of tenants. we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers.
we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development. we will continue to use our development capabilities, market presence, and anchor relationships to invest in value-added new developments and redevelopments of existing centers. we fund our acquisition and development activity from various capital sources including operating cash flow, property sales, equity offerings, new financing, and co-investment real estate partnerships. co-investment real estate partnerships provide us with an additional capital source for shopping center acquisitions, developments, and redevelopments, as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset management, property management, and other investing and financing services.
critical accounting policies and estimates knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements. the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period. these accounting estimates are based upon, but not limited to, our judgments about historical and expected future results, current market conditions, and interpretation of industry accounting standards. they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments, or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates. we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness; however, the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates.
accounts receivable and straight line rent minimum rent, percentage rent, and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs, insurance and real estate taxes are the company's principal source of revenue. as a result of generating this revenue, we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants. we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables. to address the collectability of these receivables, we analyze historical write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and straight line rent reserve. although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates.

real estate investments acquisition of real estate investments upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases and in-place leases), assumed debt, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. based on these estimates, the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities. fair value is determined based on an exit price approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. if, up to one year from the acquisition date, information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis. the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred.
we strategically co-invest with partners to own, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop operating properties. we analyze our investments in real estate partnerships in order to determine whether the entity should be consolidated. if it is determined that these investments do not require consolidation because the entities are not variable interest entities ("vies"), we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities determined to be vies, we do not have voting control, and/or the limited partners (or non-managing members) have substantive participatory rights, then the selection of the accounting method used to account for our investments in real estate partnerships is generally determined by our voting interests and the degree of influence we have over the entity. management uses its judgment when making these determinations. we use the equity method of accounting for investments in real estate partnerships when we own 20% or more of the voting interests and have significant influence but do not have a controlling financial interest, or if we own less than 20% of the voting interests but have determined that we have significant influence. under the equity method, we record our investments in and advances to these entities as investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated balance sheets, and our proportionate share of earnings or losses earned by the joint venture is recognized in equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations.
development of real estate assets and cost capitalization we capitalize the acquisition of land, the construction of buildings, and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them in properties in development in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. other specifically identifiable development costs include pre-development costs essential to the development process, as well as, interest, real estate taxes, and direct employee costs incurred during the development period. once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy, these indirect costs are no longer capitalized.
•   pre-development costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits, legal, engineering, and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center. if we determine it is probable that a specific project undergoing due diligence will not be developed, we immediately expense all related capitalized pre-development costs not considered recoverable.
•   interest costs are capitalized to each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended. we cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor opens for business. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, we capitalized interest of $7.1 million, $6.1 million, and $3.7 million, respectively, on our development projects.
•   real estate taxes are capitalized to each development project over the same period as we capitalize interest.
•   we have a staff of employees who directly support our development program. all direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project. the capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, we capitalized $16.1 million, $11.7 million, and $10.3 million, respectively, of direct internal costs incurred to support our development program.
valuation of real estate investments we evaluate whether there are any indicators that have occurred, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that would result in us determining that the carrying value of our real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable. if such indicators occur, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate
44
disposition of the asset. our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated hold period, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate. these key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment, if any, could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arm's length transaction. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value. changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the company's financial condition or operating performance.
we evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are indicators, including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired. an investment in a real estate partnerships is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an other-than-temporary basis. cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors, such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is other-than-temporary. these factors include the age of the real estate partnerships, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity and relationships with our partners and banks. if we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, no impairment charge is recorded. if our analysis indicates that there is an other-than-temporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnership, the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment.
the fair value of real estate investments is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization or the traditional discounted cash flow methods. such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors, and therefore are subject to management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value. in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.
derivative instruments the company utilizes financial derivative instruments to manage risks associated with changing interest rates. specifically, the company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or future payment of known and uncertain cash amounts, the amount of which are determined by interest rates.  the company's derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the company's known or expected cash payments principally related to the company's borrowings.  for additional information on the company's use and accounting for derivatives, see notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
the company assesses effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis. the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of equity. our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts, settlement dates, reset dates, calculation period and libor rate.  if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective, the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected.
the fair value of the company's interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.  the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.

leasing activity was strong in 2014 with pro-rata occupancy gains of 70 basis points driven primarily by new leasing in the less than 10,000 sqft category, but also supported by high renewal activity of expiring leases in both categories as summarized in the leasing activity table below, and lower than historical move-out rates. we believe our high-quality, grocery anchored shopping centers located in densely populated, desirable infill trade areas create attractive spaces for retail tenants. improvements in the economy, combined with historically low levels of new supply and robust tenant demand, allow us to focus on merchandising of our centers to ensure the right mix of operators and unique retailers, which draws more retail customers to our centers.

in january 2015, safeway inc. and ab acquisition llc (albertsons) completed their proposed merger announced in march 2014. in addition to the centers anchored by safeway above, we have 12 shopping centers anchored by albertsons, representing 1.4% of company owned gla and 1.0% of annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis. the federal trade commission ("ftc") is requiring that they divest 168 stores. of these, six are in our shopping centers and are under contract to be purchased by haggen.
bankruptcies although base rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy may have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues. we monitor the operating performance and rent collections of all tenants in our shopping centers, especially those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition, business practice, and store closings in other locations. we are not currently aware of the pending bankruptcy or announced store closings of any tenants in our shopping centers that would individually cause a material reduction in our revenues, and no tenant represents more than 5% of our annual base rent on a pro-rata basis.
our management team devotes significant time to monitoring consumer preferences, shopping behaviors, and demographics to anticipate both challenges and opportunities in the changing retail industry that may affect our tenants. as a result of our findings, we may reduce new leasing, suspend leasing, or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer.

net cash provided by operating activities:
net cash provided by operating activities increased by $27.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 due to:
•   $27.9 million increase in cash from operating income; offset by
•   $3.0 million net decrease in cash due to timing of cash receipts and payments related to operating activities;
•   $2.6 million decrease in operating cash flow distributions from our unconsolidated real estate partnerships due to liquidating three partnerships and reinvesting cash in another; and
•   $4.6 million received upon settlement of the treasury hedges in may 2014 in connection with our bond issuance.
we operate our business such that we expect net cash provided by operating activities will provide the necessary funds to pay our distributions to our common and preferred stock and unit holders, which were $194.0 million and $189.2 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. our dividend distribution policy is set by our board of directors who monitor our financial position. our board of directors recently declared our common stock quarterly dividend of $0.485 per share, payable on march 5, 2015. future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and will be subject to capital requirements and availability. we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that, at a minimum, meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a reit for federal income tax purposes.
net cash used in investing activities:
net cash used in investing activities increased by $200.5 million due to lower real estate dispositions during 2014 within our consolidated and unconsolidated portfolio coupled with a slight increase in acquisitions and development activity, which were funded from sales proceeds and financing activity.

significant investing and divesting activities included:
•   we acquired four shopping centers in 2014, compared to three during 2013;
•   we sold eleven shopping centers and six out-parcels in 2014, compared to twelve shopping centers and ten out-parcels during 2013;
•   we received proceeds of $27.4 million upon the collection and sale of notes receivable in 2013;

•   we invested $23.6 million in our unconsolidated partnerships to acquire an operating property and to fund redevelopment activity during 2014. in 2013, we invested $10.9 million primarily for mortgage maturities, one operating property acquisition, and redevelopment activity.
•   distributions from our unconsolidated partnerships in 2014 were primarily driven by real estate sales proceeds of $32.1 million and $5.1 million from refinancing a loan. distributions in 2013 were primarily from real estate sales proceeds of $32.7 million, $6.9 million net proceeds from debt refinancing, and $47.5 million distributions upon redemption of preferred interest.
•   acquisition of securities and proceeds from sale of securities include investments in equity securities. in 2014, we paid $14.3 million for the acquisition of amreit, inc. ("amreit") common stock, and received $22.1 million in proceeds upon the subsequent sale. the remaining securities investing activity, during both 2014 and 2013, primarily relates to our deferred compensation plan.
we plan to continue developing and redeveloping shopping centers for long-term investment purposes and have a staff of employees who directly support our development and redevelopment program. internal costs attributable to these development and redevelopment activities are capitalized as part of each project. during 2014, we paid $238.2 million for the development, redevelopment, and improvement of our real estate properties as comprised of the following (in thousands):

real estate development and capital improvements         $238,237           213,282       24,955
•   during 2014 we acquired six land parcels for new development projects as compared to five in 2013.
•   building and tenant improvements decreased $7.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily related to timing of capital projects and renovations.
•   the $28.9 million increase in redevelopment costs were due to an increase in the number and magnitude of redevelopments, primarily driven by our westlake and westchester redevelopment projects.
•   the $6.3 million decrease in our development projects expenditures was due to the size of and progress on developments. see the tables below for a detail of current and recently completed development projects.
•   capitalized direct compensation represents overhead costs of our development and construction team directly related to the development projects, with the majority of capitalizable direct compensation costs incurred at or near inception of a development project. the increased number and size of projects starting in 2014 as compared to 2013 resulted in the increase in capitalized compensation costs. during 2014 we started $239.2 million of development and redevelopment projects as compared to $194.3 million in 2013. changes in the level of future development and redevelopment activity could adversely impact results of operations by reducing the amount of internal costs for development and redevelopment projects that may be capitalized. a 10% reduction in development and redevelopment activity without a corresponding reduction in the compensation costs directly related to our development and redevelopment activities could result in an additional charge to net income of approximately $1.6 million.

as of december 31, 2014, we had seven development projects that were either under construction or in lease up, compared to six such development projects as of december 31, 2013. the following table summarizes our development projects as of december 31, 2014 (in thousands, except cost per sqft):

net cash used in financing activities:
net cash used in financing activities decreased by $148.2 million primarily due to proceeds from the net issuance of unsecured notes in 2014 and net repayments on the credit facilities in 2013. the following table presents changes in our primary categories of financing activity:

significant financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2014 include:
•   during 2014, the parent company issued approximately 1.7 million shares of common stock through our atm program at an average price of $60.00 per share, as compared to 1.9 million shares at $53.35 per share in 2013. in both years, the proceeds were used to fund investment activities.
•   the $6.8 million change in net distributions to limited partners is primarily related to 2014 distribution of proceeds from sales and debt financing.
•   during 2014 we increased our dividend distribution rates on our common stock and operating partnership units.
•   during 2013, we paid down our line and term loan $95.0 million, net.
•   the $222.6 million net change in debt issuance is primarily related to the $250 million of new 3.75% ten-year unsecured public debt issued in may 2014, which matures in june 2024. in connection with the bond offering, we settled the previously locked forward starting interest rate swaps, receiving net cash proceeds of $4.6 million. these proceeds will offset bond interest expense over the life of the bonds, resulting in a lower effective interest rate of 3.59%.
•   the $160.1 million net change in debt repayment is primarily driven by the repayment of $150 million of 4.95% ten-year unsecured public debt at maturity. in april 2014.
we endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets. as of december 31, 2014, 76.8% of our wholly-owned real estate assets were unencumbered. such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain significant availability on the line. our coverage ratio, including our pro-rata share of our partnerships, was 2.5 times for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to 2.4 times for the year ended december 31, 2013. we define our coverage ratio as earnings before interest, taxes, investment transaction profits net of deal costs, depreciation and amortization ("core ebitda") divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders.
through 2015, we estimate that we will require approximately $622.7 million of cash, including $179.2 million to complete in-process developments and redevelopments, $426.2 million to repay maturing debt, and approximately $17.3 to fund our pro-rata share of estimated capital contributions to our co-investment partnerships for repayment of debt. if we start new developments or redevelop additional shopping centers, our cash requirements will increase. if we refinance maturing debt, our cash requirements will decrease. to meet our cash requirements, we will utilize cash generated from operations, borrowings from our line and term loan, proceeds from the sale of real estate, cash receipts from our forward equity offering, and when the capital markets are favorable, proceeds from the sale of equity and the issuance of debt.
we have $350.0 million of fixed rate, unsecured debt maturing in august 2015 and $400.0 million of fixed rate, unsecured debt maturing in june 2017. in order to mitigate the risk of interest rate volatility, we previously entered into $220.0 million of forward starting interest rate swaps to partially hedge the new debt expected to be issued in 2015 and an additional $220.0 million of forward starting interest rate swaps to partially hedge the new debt expected to be issued in 2017. these interest rate swaps lock in the 10-year treasury rate and swap spread at a weighted average fixed rate of 2.67% and 3.48%, respectively. a current market based credit spread applicable to regency will be added to the locked in fixed rate at time of issuance that will determine the final bond yield. we will cash settle these forward starting interest rate swaps when we issue the new debt. the actual cash settlement may differ from the current fair value of these interest rate swaps based on movements in interest rates.
we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments. based upon the current capital markets, our current credit ratings, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings, we currently expect that we will successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund our obligations, as needed.
our line, term loan, and unsecured loans require we remain in compliance with various covenants, which are described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31, 2014 and expect to remain in compliance.

(1) pro-rata financial information is not, and is not intended to be, a presentation in accordance with gaap. however, management believes that providing such information is useful to investors in assessing the impact of its investments in real estate partnership activities on our operations, which includes such items on a single line presentation under the equity method in its consolidated financial statements.
(2) the difference between our share of the net assets of the co-investment partnerships and our investments in real estate partnerships per the accompanying consolidated balance sheets relates primarily to differences in inside/outside basis as further described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
in addition to earning our pro-rata share of net income or loss in each of these co-investment partnerships, we receive fees, as shown below, for each of the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 (dollars in thousands):

contractual obligations we have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans, unsecured notes, unsecured credit facilities and interest rate swap obligations as described further below and in note 9 and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. we have shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct and/or operate a shopping center. in addition, we have non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business.
the following table of contractual obligations summarizes our debt maturities, including our pro-rata share of obligations within co-investment partnerships, (in thousands) as of december 31, 2014, and excludes the following:
•   recorded debt premiums or discounts that are not obligations;
•   obligations related to construction or development contracts, since payments are only due upon satisfactory performance under the contracts;
•   letters of credit of $5.9 million issued to cover performance obligations on certain development projects, which will be satisfied upon completion of the development projects; and,
•   obligations for retirement savings plans due to uncertainty around timing of participant withdrawals, which are solely within the control of the participant, and are further discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

(2) we are obligated to contribute our pro-rata share to fund maturities if they are not refinanced. we believe that our partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements.  in the event that a co-investment partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the co-investment partnership, we would have the right, but not the obligation, to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call.

off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities (other than our co-investment partnerships) or other persons, also known as variable interest entities, not previously discussed. our co-investment partnership properties have been financed with non-recourse loans. we have no guarantees related to these loans.
results from operations comparison of the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013:
our revenues increased in 2014, as compared to 2013, as summarized in the following table (in thousands):

minimum rent increased as follows:
•   $29.1 million increase due to the acquisitions of operating properties and operations beginning at development properties;
•   $9.9 million increase in minimum rent from same properties, which was driven by rental rate and occupancy growth and increases from contractual rent steps in existing leases. same property includes operating properties owned for the entirety of both periods being presented;
•   these increases were offset by a $2.2 decrease from operating properties sold in 2014 that no longer are reported as discontinued operations.
recoveries from tenants and other income represent reimbursements from tenants for their pro-rata share of the operating, maintenance, and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers, as well as other income earned at our operating properties. increases are due to the following:
•   $6.9 million increase due to the acquisition of operating properties and operations beginning at development properties during 2014 and 2013; and,
•   $6.2 million increase in recoveries at same properties, which was driven by an increase in occupancy and by an increase in recoverable costs, and $1.4 million increase in other income primarily related to settlements and termination fees;
•   offset by a $1.4 million decrease from operating properties sold in 2014 that no longer are reported as discontinued operations.
we earned fees, at market-based rates, for asset management, property management, leasing, acquisition, and financing services that we provided to our co-investment partnerships and third parties as follows (in thousands):
2014                2013                   change asset management fees                       $6,013            6,205         (192   )

$24,095           25,097       (1,002   )
asset and property management fees decreased due to the liquidation of one unconsolidated real estate partnership consisting of nine properties during the third quarter of 2013, partially offset by higher asset and property management fees from our other partnerships.

total operating expenses               $353,348           324,687           28,661
depreciation and amortization increased $17.2 million. the increase is largely attributable to the following: $9.9 million from acquisitions, $5.5 million from new development operations and $2.6 million at same properties due to redevelopments and capital improvements, offset by a decrease of approximately $800,000 from disposals.
operating and maintenance increased $6.8 million. the increase relates to the following: $2.0 million from acquisitions, $2.6 million from new development operations, and $2.4 million at same property driven by an increase in snow removal costs, offset by approximately $200,000 from sold properties.
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $1.0 million largely due to greater capitalization of development overhead costs by $4.4 million, stemming from higher volume of development projects, offset by an increase of $4.6 million of higher incentive compensation expense during 2014. additionally, changes in participant obligations within the deferred compensation plan resulted in a $1.9 million decrease in expense.
real estate taxes increased $5.3 million. the increase largely consists of the following: $2.6 million from acquisitions, $1.6 million from new development operations, and $1.4 million at same properties from higher assessed values, partially offset by approximately $300,000 from sold properties.

see table below for a discussion of interest expense.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recognized a $175,000 impairment on two parcels of land held and $1.1 million of loss on the disposal of one operating property and one land parcel. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recognized a $6.0 million impairment on a single operating property.
net investment income increased $6.2 million, largely driven by an $8.1 million gain realized on the sale of available for sale securities offset by a $1.9 million decrease in net investment income from deferred compensation plan related to the change in the fair value of plan assets.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we acquired the remaining 50% interest and gained control of a previously unconsolidated investment in real estate partnership that owns a single operating property. as the operating property constitutes a business, acquisition of control was accounted for as a step acquisition, and the net assets acquired were recognized at fair value. the gain of $18.3 million was recognized as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the company's previously held equity interest, using an income approach to measure fair value.

(1) as of december 31, 2012, our ownership interest in mcwr iii was 24.95%. the liquidation of mcwr iii was complete effective march 20, 2013.
(2) on august 13, 2013, regency retail partners, lp (the "fund") sold 100% of its interest in its entire portfolio of shopping centers to a third party. the fund was dissolved following the final distribution of proceeds in 2014.
(3) on october 23, 2013, the company sold 100% of its interest in the bret unconsolidated real estate partnership and received a capital distribution of $47.5 million, its share of the undistributed income of the partnership, and a redemption premium. regency no longer has any interest in the bret partnership.
the decrease in our equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships is principally due to the following:
•   $947,000 of pro-rata gains on one operating property disposed of within grir.
•   $1.0 million decrease within columbia ii due to $424,000 of pro-rata impairment losses recognized upon sale of two properties in 2014 and $830,000 of gains recognized in 2013 on the sale of 4 operating properties and one land parcel;
•   $654,000 of pro-rata gains on one operating property disposed of within regcal in 2014;
•   the fund sold all its operating properties in august 2013 for pro-rata gains of $7.4 million. the only activity in 2014 was collection of remaining receivables and the final distribution;
•   $4.5 million decrease from liquidating our ownership interest in bret in october 2013; and,
•   $11.2 million increase within our other investment partnerships driven by the 2014 gains on sale of two land parcels and two operating properties.

minimum rent increased as follows:
•   $22.5 million increase due to the acquisitions of operating properties and operations beginning at development properties; and
•   $8.2 million increase in minimum rent from same properties, which was driven by rental rate and occupancy growth and increases from contractual rent steps in existing leases. same property includes operating properties owned for the entirety of both periods being presented.
•   these increases were offset by a $17.8 million decrease due to the sale of a 15-property portfolio in july 2012 not considered discontinued operations.
recoveries from tenants and other income represent reimbursements from tenants for their pro-rata share of the operating, maintenance, and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers, as well as other income earned at our operating properties. increases are due to the following:
•   $4.7 million increase due to the acquisition of operating properties and operations beginning at development properties during 2013 and 2012; and
•   $6.1 million increase in recoveries at same properties, which was driven primarily by an increase in occupancy and an increase in recoverable costs.
59
•   these increases were offset by a $5.1 million decrease due to the sale of a 15-property portfolio in july 2012 not considered discontinued operations.
other income decreased by $2.2 million as a result of final distributions from our terminated third party managed captive insurance program and establishing a consolidated captive insurance subsidiary during 2012.
we earned fees, at market-based rates, for asset management, property management, leasing, acquisition, disposition and financing services that we provided to our co-investment partnerships and third parties as follows (in thousands):
2013                2012                   change asset management fees                       $6,205            6,488         (283   )
property management fees                    13,692           14,224         (532   )
leasing commissions and other fees           5,200            5,799         (599   )
$25,097           26,511       (1,414   )
asset and property management fees decreased approximately $815,000 due to the liquidation of two unconsolidated real estate partnerships during 2013, resulting in $1.1 million reduction in asset and property management fees, partially offset by higher asset and property management fees from our other partnerships. leasing commissions and other fees decreased during 2013, as compared to 2012, due to the two liquidations discussed above and a decrease in leasing activities performed for co-investment partnerships and third parties during 2013, as occupancy levels stabilize and less vacant gla was available for lease.
our operating expenses increased as summarized in the following table (in thousands):
2013                  2012                        change depreciation and amortization          $130,630           119,008           11,622

other operating expenses                  8,079             7,187              892
total operating expenses               $324,687           307,493           17,194
depreciation and amortization increased $11.6 million. the increase is largely attributable to the following: $8.3 million from acquisitions, $6.5 million at same properties, and $4.7 million from new development operations, offset by $7.5 million decrease from the sale of a 15 property portfolio in july 2012 not considered discontinued operations.
operating and maintenance increased $4.3 million. the increase substantially relates to the following: $4.0 million from acquisitions, $1.6 million from new development operations, and $3.0 million at same properties, offset by $4.3 million from the sale of a 15 property portfolio in july 2012 not considered discontinued operations.
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $466,000 largely due to greater capitalization of development overhead costs of approximately $1.4 million, due to higher volume of development projects, offset by a decrease in capitalization of leasing overhead costs of $1.2 million as occupancy levels stabilize and less vacant gla was available to lease. the net change in compensation and other overhead costs resulted in additional savings of approximately $200,000.
real estate taxes increased approximately $815,000. the increase largely consists of the following: $2.4 million from acquisitions and new development operations, $1.3 million at same properties from higher assessed values, offset by $2.9 million from the sale of a 15 property portfolio in july 2012 not considered discontinued operations.
other operating expenses increased approximately $892,000 primarily due to an increase in environmental remediation reserves, offset by decreases in bad debt expense and acquisition and pursuit costs.

see table below for a discussion of interest expense.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recognized a $6.0 million impairment on a single operating property. during the year ended december 31, 2012, we recognized total impairments of $20.3 million, including $18.1 million related to the 15-property portfolio sold in july 2012, and $2.2 million related to three land parcels.
during 2013, we repaid two mortgages early with minimal remaining unamortized loan costs. on july 20, 2012, we repaid $150.0 million of our term loan, and as a result of this early extinguishment of debt, we expensed approximately $852,000 in remaining unamortized loan costs.
the $1.2 million increase in net investment income from deferred compensation plan related to the change in the fair value of plan assets from december 31, 2012 to december 31, 2013 and is consistent with the change in plan liabilities, included in general and administrative expenses above.
the following table presents the change in interest expense (in thousands):

$108,966           112,129           (3,163   )
our interest expense decreased primarily due to paying down our unsecured credit facilities and mortgages, coupled with greater interest capitalization on development projects, driven by the increase in cumulative development project costs over the prior year.

(1) as of december 31, 2012, our ownership interest in mcwr iii was 24.95%. the liquidation of mcwr iii was complete effective march 20, 2013.
(2) on august 13, 2013, regency retail partners, lp (the "fund") sold 100% of its interest in its entire portfolio of shopping centers to a third party. the fund will be dissolved following the final distribution of proceeds.
(3) on october 23, 2013, the company sold 100% of its interest in the bret unconsolidated real estate partnership and received a capital distribution of $47.5 million, its share of the undistributed income of the partnership, and a redemption premium. regency no longer has any interest in the bret partnership.
the increase in our equity in income in investments in real estate partnerships is principally due to the following:
•   $3.5 million increase from the grir partnership due to various factors, including: increased tenant percentage rent, recovery revenue rates, and settlement proceeds; coupled with lower interest expense as a result of paying off debt in 2012 and the loss on debt extinguishment and provision for impairment in 2012 that did not occur in 2013. these increases are offset by higher depreciation expense from redevelopments.
•   $6.8 million decrease from the columbia i partnership primarily due to our $6.9 million pro-rata gain on sale of an operating property that was sold in april 2012,
•   $7.5 million increase from the fund due to recognizing $7.4 million pro-rata gain on the sale of all operating properties within the fund in august 2013, and
•   $2.3 million increase from our ownership interest retained in bret, as part of the 15-property portfolio sale completed in july 2012, which we redeemed 100% of our ownership interest for cash in october 2013.

the decrease in income tax expense of taxable reit subsidiary is due to the large expense recognized during 2012 as a full valuation allowance was established on the balance of our deferred tax assets.
income from discontinued operations of $65.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 included $58.0 million in gains, net of taxes, from the sale of twelve properties and the operations of the shopping centers sold. loss from discontinued operations of $21.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2012 included the operations of the shopping centers sold during 2012 and 2013, and $21.9 million in gains, net of taxes, from the sale of five properties; offset by $54.5 million of impairment losses.
the decrease in preferred stock dividends is attributable to the $9.3 million non-cash charges recognized during 2012 upon redemption of the series 3, 4 and 5 preferred stock.

supplemental earnings information we use certain non-gaap performance measures, in addition to the required gaap presentations, as we believe these measures are beneficial to us in improving the understanding of our operational results among the investing public. we believe such measures make comparisons of other reits' operating results to ours more meaningful. we continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, and calculation of our reported non-gaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.
the following are our definitions of same property net operating income ("noi"), funds from operations ("ffo"), and core ffo, which we believe to be beneficial non-gaap performance measures used in understanding our operational results:
   noi is calculated as total property revenues (minimum rent, percentage rents, and recoveries from tenants and other income) less direct property operating expenses (operating and maintenance and real estate taxes) from the properties owned by us, and excludes corporate-level income (including management, transaction, and other fees), for the entirety of the periods presented. noi excludes straight-line rental income, net of reserves, above and below market rent amortization, banking charges, and other fees
•   pro-rata information includes 100% of our consolidated properties plus our ownership interest in our unconsolidated real estate investment partnerships.
•   same property information is provided for operating properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared and excludes all properties in development and non-same properties. a non-same property is a property acquired during either period being compared, a development completion that is less than 90% funded and 95% leased or features less than two years of anchor operations. same property also excludes projects in development, which represent projects owned and intended to be developed, including partially operating properties acquired specifically for redevelopment and excluding land held for future development. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for an expanded definition of properties in development.
•   same property noi includes noi for same property, which is a key measure used by management in evaluating the performance of our properties.
•   ffo is a commonly used measure of reit performance, which the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") defines as net income, computed in accordance with gaap, excluding gains and losses from sales of depreciable property, net of tax, excluding operating real estate impairments, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. we compute ffo for all periods presented in accordance with nareit's definition. many companies use different depreciable lives and methods, and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions. since ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from depreciable property dispositions, and impairments, it can provide a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. this provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with gaap. thus, ffo is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of our operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore, should not be considered an alternative for cash flow as a measure of liquidity.
•   core ffo is an additional performance measure used by regency as the computation of ffo includes certain non-cash and non-comparable items that affect the company's period-over-period performance. core ffo excludes from ffo, but is not limited to: (a) transaction related gains, income or expense; (b) impairments on land; (c) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; and (d) other non-core amounts as they occur. the company provides a reconciliation of ffo to core ffo below.

environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and underground petroleum storage tanks. we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations. generally, we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems. where available, we have applied and been accepted into state-sponsored environmental programs. we have a blanket environmental insurance policy for third-party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination. we have also placed environmental insurance, where possible, on specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate our environmental risk. we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites. we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so.
as of december 31, 2014 we had accrued liabilities of $10.2 million for our pro-rata share of environmental remediation. we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations; however, we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us.
inflation/deflation inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers; however, inflation may become a greater concern in the future. substantially all of our long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. most of our leases require tenants to pay their pro-rata share of operating expenses, including common-area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. in addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates. however, during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness, minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines. occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses.

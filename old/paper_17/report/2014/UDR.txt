item 1a. risk factors there are many factors that affect the business and the results of operations of the company and the operating partnership, some of which are beyond the control of the company and the operating partnership. the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by law.
risks related to our real estate investments and our operations unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels, rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets. unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, recession, personal debt levels, a downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, generally do not decline when related rents decline. we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues and/or the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr's stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities. factors that may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our properties include the following, among others:
•   downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment;
•   declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable;
•   government or builder incentives which enable first time homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing options more attractive;
•   local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes;
•   declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants;
•   changes in market rental rates;
•   our ability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms;
9
•   the timing and costs associated with property improvements, repairs or renovations;
•   declines in household formation; and
•   rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs.
we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire. when our residents decide to leave our apartments, whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date, we may not be able to relet their apartment units. even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms. if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. if residents do not experience increases in their income, we may be unable to increase rent and/or delinquencies may increase.
substantial international, national and local government spending and increasing deficits may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. the values of, and the cash flows from, the properties we own are affected by developments in global, national and local economies. as a result of the most recent recession and the significant government interventions, federal, state and local governments have incurred record deficits and assumed or guaranteed liabilities of private financial institutions or other private entities. these increased budget deficits and the weakened financial condition of federal, state and local governments may lead to reduced governmental spending, tax increases, public sector job losses, increased interest rates, currency devaluations or other adverse economic events, which may directly or indirectly adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
risk of inflation/deflation. substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. the general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate faster than increases in our rental rates, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions to udr's stockholders. the predominant effects of deflation include high unemployment and credit contraction. restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties.
we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility. we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities:
•   a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or the "code," so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales; and
•   federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable.
competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents. our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single-and multi-family homes. competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies. we have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:
10
•   we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;
•   even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the acquisition;
•   even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after incurring certain acquisition-related costs;
•   we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are subsequently unable to complete;
•   when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability;
•   the expected occupancy rates and rental rates may differ from actual results; and
•   we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability.
competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties. in the past, other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties, and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns.
development and construction risks could impact our profitability. in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise. development activities have been, and in the future may be, conducted through wholly-owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks:
•   we may be unable to obtain construction financing for development activities under favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, maturity dates and/or loan to value ratios, or at all which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential developments;
•   we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations;
•   yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents than expected;
•   if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable financing for the developments, our development capacity may be limited;
•   we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities;
•   we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs;
•   occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community; and
•   when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance.
11
in some cases in the past, the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates. we may experience similar cost increases in the future. our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability.
bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance. we have relationships with and, from time to time, we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties, such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities. as a result, bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties could result in services not being provided, projects not being completed on time, or on budget, or at all, or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties' ability to complete transactions with us as intended, both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest. we have in the past and may in the future develop and/or acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. we currently have 15 active joint ventures and partnerships, excluding our participating loan investment, with a total equity investment of $655.5 million. we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. moreover, joint venture partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. in some instances, joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. also, our joint venture partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses. in general, we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners' interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the joint venture (if we are the seller) or of the other partner's interest in the joint venture (if we are the buyer) at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm's length marketing process.
we are also subject to risk in cases where an institutional owner is our joint venture partner, including (i) a deadlock if we and our joint venture partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions, (ii) the limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the joint venture without the consent of the other joint venture partner, and (iii) the requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture.
we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance. we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities with limits of liability customary within the multi-family industry. we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. there are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program. in addition, we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage.
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. in such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to udr's stockholders.
as a result of our substantial real estate holdings, the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense. insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, which are generally outside of our control. we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect. the financial condition of one or more of our insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted, which could result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims. their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results. in addition, the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties.
failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth. we have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise, apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets. entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. these risks include, among others:
•   inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies;
12
•   inability to hire and retain key personnel;
•   lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and
•   inability to achieve budgeted financial results.
potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. in addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. these costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property.
in addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks. noncompliance with these environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to liability. changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws, health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance. this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations.
as the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. for example, buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material, or acm. environmental, health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners, operators or employers for non-compliance with those requirements.
these requirements include special precautions, such as removal, abatement or air monitoring, if acm would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially resulting in substantial costs. in addition, we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment.
we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation. when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. as a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. in addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs.
compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs. the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the americans with disabilities act. if, under the americans with disabilities act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. we do not
13
know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.
compliance with or changes in real estate tax and other laws could adversely affect our funds from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders. generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. we also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes, to tenants under leases. these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. similarly, compliance with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing, such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect our funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders.
risk of damage from catastrophic weather and natural events and potential climate change. certain of our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time, including mudslides, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, snow or ice storms, or other severe inclement weather. these adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations.
to the extent that we experience any significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located, we may experience extreme weather conditions and prolonged changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which could result in physical damage to, and/or a decrease in demand for, our communities located in these areas. should the impact of such climate change be material in nature, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
risk of earthquake damage. some of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity. as a result, we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it, in management's view, economically impractical.
risk of accidental death due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards. the accidental death of persons living in our communities due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events, and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where such any such events have occurred, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets. actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack. in addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the u.s. economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income-producing properties. we may acquire mezzanine loans, which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property, because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property. in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower
14
bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. as a result, we may not recover some of or all our initial expenditure. in addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal.
we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr's common stock. a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states ("gaap"), if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets. if such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired. such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future, these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and the per share trading price of udr's common stock.
any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr's stock price. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on udr's stock price.
our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures or breaches in data security. despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failures. we rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and keeping of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. we rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. although we take steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems' improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information, such as in the event of cyber attacks. security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us.
our success depends on our senior management. our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, whose continued service is not guaranteed. we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us. the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we may be adversely affected by new federal laws and regulations. the united states administration and congress have enacted, or called for consideration of, proposals relating to a variety of issues, including with respect to health care, financial regulation reform, climate change, executive compensation and others. we believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material. at this time, we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us.
federal rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the most recent economic recession. these initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the united states at least since the wave of lawmaking and regulatory reform that followed in the wake of the great depression. the federal legislative response in this area culminated in the enactment on july 21, 2010 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ("dodd-frank act"). many of the provisions of the dodd-frank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and continue to require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities; thus, the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time. the dodd-frank act, including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are
15
proposed or pending in the united states congress, may limit our revenues, impose fees or taxes on us, and/or intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable.
changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular, including certain provisions of the dodd-frank act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the u.s. public markets. because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure, our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies. we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards, and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities.
we may be adversely affected by new state and local laws and regulations. we are subject to state and local laws, regulations and ordinances at locations where we operate and to the rules and regulations of various local authorities regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, our operations. we cannot predict what matters might be considered in the future by these state and local authorities, nor can we judge what impact, if any, the implementation of new legislation might have on our business.
changes in u.s. accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations. accounting for public companies in the united states is in accordance with gaap, which is established by the financial accounting standards board (the "fasb"), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies. uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the fasb and the sec, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for u.s. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements.
risks related to our indebtedness and financings insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk. we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr's distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes. in addition, the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. we may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. in addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr's stockholders.
failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders. if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr's stockholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities:
•   the national and local economies;
•   local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes;
•   tenants' perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located;
•   our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance;
•   rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities;
•   competition from other apartment communities;
16
•   changes in interest rates and the availability of financing;
•   changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance; and
•   changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multi-family housing.
expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community. if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder.
our debt level may be increased. our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt.
financing may not be available and could be dilutive. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time. if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted.
failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. moody's and standard & poor's, the major debt rating agencies, routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt and preferred stock. these ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. due to changes in these factors and market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets.
disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr's stock. our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. during the global financial crisis and the economic recession that followed it, the united states stock and credit markets experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably. those circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets at times, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing. any future disruptions or uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all, which may negatively affect our business and the market price of udr's common stock. if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness when it becomes due, we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations. a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr's common or preferred stock.
a change in u.s. government policy regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business. fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate. we and other multifamily companies depend heavily on fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans. in september 2008, the u.s. government assumed control of fannie mae and freddie mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the federal housing finance agency. the administration and lawmakers have proposed potential options for the future of mortgage finance in the u.s. that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac. while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector, should they discontinue doing so, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to sell assets. uncertainty in the future activity and involvement of fannie mae and freddie mac as a source of financing could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing.
17
the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us. we have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, could result in losses or defaults by these institutions. in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities. we currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates. as of december 31, 2014, udr had approximately $579.7 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 16.1% of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. as of december 31, 2014, the operating partnership had approximately $219.8 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 23.6% of total outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date. an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt. accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of udr's common and preferred stock and debt securities.
interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges. from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.
risks related to tax laws we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit. udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. in addition, u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr's stockholders.
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr's stockholders in computing our taxable income. also, unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we could not re-elect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit. the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr's stockholders. this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. in addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr's stockholders. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.
certain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be taxed as a reit under the code, and are therefore subject to the same risks in the event that they fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year.
18
dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates. in general, the maximum u.s. federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual u.s. stockholders is 20%. unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit, our distributions to individual stockholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates.
udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries, which are subject to certain tax risks. we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries. despite udr's qualification as a reit, its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. in addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests. while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm's length in nature or are otherwise not respected.
reit distribution requirements limit our available cash. as a reit, udr is subject to annual distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. we generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net reit taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax. we intend to make distributions to udr's stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code. however, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the code.
certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. from time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. under the code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. however, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr's ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes.
we could face possible state and local tax audits and adverse changes in state and local tax laws. as discussed in the risk factors above, because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but it is subject to certain state and local taxes. from time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. if such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr's stockholders. in the normal course of business, entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits. if such entities become subject to state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership, but cannot guarantee that it will qualify. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes at any such time that the operating partnership admits additional limited partners other than udr. if classified as a partnership, the operating partnership generally will not be a taxable entity and will not incur federal income tax liability. however, the operating partnership would be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if it were a "publicly traded partnership," unless at least 90% of the operating partnership's income was qualifying income as defined in the code. a "publicly traded partnership" is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). although the operating partnership's partnership units are not traded on an established securities market, because of the redemption right, the operating partnership's units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof), and the operating partnership may not qualify for one of the "safe harbors" under the applicable tax regulations. qualifying income for the 90% test generally includes passive income, such as real property rents, dividends and interest. the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90% test are similar in most respects. the operating partnership may not meet this qualifying income test. if the operating partnership were to be taxed as a corporation, it would incur substantial tax
19
liabilities, and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes, unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions, and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired.
qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code. our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification. moreover, new legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit. our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals, and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. in addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes.
risks related to our organization and ownership of udr's stock changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr's common stock. the stock markets, including the new york stock exchange ("nyse"), on which we list udr's common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of udr's common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in udr's common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. in addition to the risks listed in this "risk factors" section, a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr's common stock, including:
•   general market and economic conditions;
•   actual or anticipated variations in udr's quarterly operating results or dividends or udr's payment of dividends in shares of udr's stock;
•   changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates;
•   difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance existing debt;
•   decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations;
•   changes in market valuations of similar companies;
•   publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry;
•   the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate companies);
•   general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of udr's stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends;
•   a change in analyst ratings;
•   additions or departures of key management personnel;
•   adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;
•   speculation in the press or investment community;
•   terrorist activity which may adversely affect the markets in which udr's securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending;
•   failure to qualify as a reit;
•   strategic decisions by us or by our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;
20
•   failure to satisfy listing requirements of the nyse;
•   governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and
•   the issuance of additional shares of udr's common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, including under udr's at-the-market equity distribution program.
many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr's common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or our prospects.
we may change the dividend policy for udr's common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr's common stock, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of udr's common stock.
maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which may not be in udr's stockholders' best interests. maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. as a maryland corporation, we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in udr's stockholders' best interests. the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr's stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors' prior approval. any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2/3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote.
limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr's stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr's stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr's stockholders. one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the code, during the last half of any taxable year. our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr's stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not threaten reit status. these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. absent such an exemption from our board of directors, the transfer of udr's stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit, or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits, will be considered null and void, and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares. these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr's stockholders or might otherwise be in udr's stockholders' best interests.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward-looking statements this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements concerning property acquisitions and dispositions, development activity and capital expenditures, capital raising activities, rent growth, occupancy, and rental expense growth. words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "likely," "will," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from the results of operations or plans expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. such factors include, among other things, unfavorable changes in the apartment market, changing economic conditions, the impact of inflation/deflation on rental rates and property operating expenses, expectations concerning availability of capital and the stabilization of the capital markets, the impact of competition and competitive pricing, acquisitions, developments and redevelopments not achieving anticipated results, delays in completing developments, redevelopments and lease-ups on schedule, expectations on job growth, home affordability and demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing, expectations concerning development and redevelopment activities, expectations on occupancy levels, expectations concerning the joint ventures with third parties, expectations that automation will help grow net operating income, and expectations on annualized net operating income.
the following factors, among others, could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements:
•   general economic conditions;
•   unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions that could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates;
•   the failure of acquisitions to achieve anticipated results;
•   possible difficulty in selling apartment communities;
•   competitive factors that may limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents;
•   insufficient cash flow that could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk;
•   failure to generate sufficient revenue, which could impair our debt service payments and distributions to stockholders;
•   development and construction risks that may impact our profitability;
•   potential damage from natural disasters, including hurricanes and other weather-related events, which could result in substantial costs to us;
•   risks from extraordinary losses for which we may not have insurance or adequate reserves;
•   uninsured losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insurance retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage;
•   delays in completing developments and lease-ups on schedule;
•   our failure to succeed in new markets;
•   changing interest rates, which could increase interest costs and affect the market price of our securities;
•   potential liability for environmental contamination, which could result in substantial costs to us;
•   the imposition of federal taxes if we fail to qualify as a reit under the code in any taxable year;
32
•   our internal control over financial reporting may not be considered effective which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports, and in turn have an adverse effect on our stock price; and
•   changes in real estate laws, tax laws and other laws affecting our business.
a discussion of these and other factors affecting our business and prospects is set forth in part ii, item 1a. risk factors. we encourage investors to review these risk factors.
although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore such statements included in this report may not prove to be accurate. in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or our objectives and plans will be achieved.
forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by law.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein and is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 of each of udr, inc. and united domination realty, l.p.
udr, inc.:
business overview we are a self-administered real estate investment trust, or reit, that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, and manages apartment communities. we were formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation. in june 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland. our subsidiaries include the operating partnership. unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to "we," "us," "our," "the company," or "udr" refer collectively to udr, inc., its subsidiaries and its consolidated joint ventures.
at december 31, 2014, our consolidated real estate portfolio included 139 communities in 10 states plus the district of columbia totaling 39,851 apartment homes, and our total real estate portfolio, inclusive of our unconsolidated communities, included an additional 36 communities with 10,055 apartment homes.
at december 31, 2014, the company was developing one wholly-owned community with 369 apartment homes and three unconsolidated joint venture communities with 1,018 apartment homes, none of which have been completed. in addition, the company was redeveloping 708 apartment homes, 694 of which have been completed, at one wholly-owned community with 739 apartment homes.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty. estimates are prepared based on management's assessment after considering all evidence available. changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations. below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required. a discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in note 2, significant accounting policies, to the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report.
cost capitalization in conformity with gaap, we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset. expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred.
33
in addition, we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment, development, and redevelopment of a capital project, which include, but are not limited to, interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects. we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for lease-up, the company ceases capitalization on the related portion. the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned, net of accumulated depreciation. amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were $29.2 million, $40.5 million, and $36.4 million, respectively.
investment in unconsolidated joint ventures we may enter into various joint venture agreements and/or partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting. we determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement, applying the applicable accounting guidance. the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment. we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs. throughout our financial statements, and in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, we use the term "joint venture" or "partnership" when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100% ownership interest.
we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an other-than-temporary decline in value. we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is other-than-temporary. these factors include, but are not limited to, age of the venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity, and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders. the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment's carrying amount over its estimated fair value. if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary, no impairment is recorded. the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property. should the actual results differ from management's judgment, the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements.
impairment of long-lived assets we record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets. our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value. our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs (defined as level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy) related to rental rates, operating costs, growth rates, discount rates, capitalization rates, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.
real estate investment properties we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components, such as land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place leases, based on the fair value of each component. in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize various sources, including independent appraisals, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates. as such, the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial lease-up period. we determine the fair value of in-place leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition. in addition, we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases, the foregone rents associated with the lease-up period, and the carrying costs associated with the lease-up period. the fair value of in-place leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period.
34
reit status we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit. a reit is a legal entity that holds interests in real estate and is required by the code to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that a reit must distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than our net capital gain) to our stockholders. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four years. based on the net earnings reported for the year ended december 31, 2014 in our consolidated statements of operations, we would have incurred federal and state gaap income taxes if we had failed to qualify as a reit.

(a)   monthly income per occupied home represents total monthly revenues divided by the product of occupancy and the number of mature apartment homes.
(b)   as of december 31, 2014, the company was developing one wholly-owned community with 369 apartment homes, which has not been completed.
we report in two segments: same-store communities and non-mature communities/other.
our same-store communities segment represents those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to january 1, 2013 and held as of december 31, 2014. these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the communities are not classified as held for sale at year end. a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months.
our non-mature communities/other segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same-store communities, including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows, sales of properties, borrowings under our credit agreements, and/or the issuance of debt and/or equity securities. our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates, occupancy levels, and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings under our credit agreements. we routinely use our unsecured revolving credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longer-term financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities. during the past several years, proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio.
we expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under our credit agreements. we expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, the repayment of financing on development activities, and potential property acquisitions, through secured and unsecured borrowings, the issuance of debt or equity securities, and/or the disposition of properties. we believe that our net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under credit agreements will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements. likewise, the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations, borrowings under credit agreements, the issuance of debt or equity securities, and dispositions of properties.
we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission, or "sec," which provides for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities, warrants, subscription rights, purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets. access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance.
during 2014, the company issued $300 million of 3.750% senior unsecured medium-term notes due july 1, 2024. interest is payable semi-annually beginning on january 1, 2015. the notes were priced at 99.652% of the principal amount at issuance. we used the net proceeds to pay down borrowings outstanding on our $900 million unsecured credit facility and for general corporate purposes. the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the operating partnership.
in april 2012, the company entered into a new equity distribution agreement, which was amended in july 2014, under which the company could offer and sell up to 20 million shares of its common stock, from time to time, to or through its sales agents. during the year ended december 31, 2014, the company sold 3,410,433 shares of common stock through this program for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $102.1 million at a weighted average price per share of $29.95. aggregate net proceeds from such sales, after deducting related expenses, including commissions paid to the sales agents of approximately $2.3 million, were approximately $99.8 million, which was primarily used to fund the company's steele creek participating loan investment. as of december 31, 2014, we had 16,518,567 shares of common stock available for sale under the april 2012 program.
future capital needs future development and redevelopment expenditures may be funded through unsecured or secured credit facilities, proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt securities, sales of properties, joint ventures, and, to a lesser extent, from cash flows provided by property operations. acquisition activity in strategic markets may be funded through joint ventures, by the
36
reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties, through the issuance of equity or debt securities, the issuance of operating partnership units and the assumption or placement of secured and/or unsecured debt.
during 2015, we have approximately $196.6 million of secured debt maturing, inclusive of principal amortization, and $324.3 million of unsecured debt maturing. in january 2015, we paid off $325.2 million of 5.25% medium-term notes due january 2015 with borrowings under the company's $900 million unsecured revolving credit facility. we anticipate repaying the remaining debt with cash flow from our operations, proceeds from debt or equity offerings, proceeds from the dispositions of properties, or from borrowings under our credit agreements.
statements of cash flow the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities, net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities, and net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012.
operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2014, net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities was $392.4 million compared to $339.9 million for 2013. the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to improved income from continuing operations and changes in operating assets and liabilities.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities was $339.9 million compared to $327.2 million for 2012. the increase in cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to improved income from continuing operations, partially offset by changes in operating assets and operating liabilities.
investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014, net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities was $(293.7) million compared to $(123.2) million for 2013. the increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily related to increased acquisitions of real estate and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, partially offset by increased proceeds from sales of real estate, lower spend on development and redevelopment, and repayment of notes receivable.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities was $(123.2) million compared to $(211.6) million in 2012. the change in investing activities was due to changes in the level of investment activities, which reflect our strategy as it relates to our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships, acquisitions, dispositions, capital expenditures, and development activities, all of which are discussed in further detail throughout this report.
acquisitions in 2014, the company acquired a fully-entitled land parcel for future development located in huntington beach, california for $77.8 million, two communities located in seattle, washington and kirkland, washington with a total of 358 apartment homes for $45.5 million and $75.2 million, respectively, and a land parcel for future development located in boston, massachusetts for $32.2 million the four acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2014 were accomplished through tax-deferred exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code.
the company did not acquire any real estate assets in 2013. during 2012, the company acquired the remaining 80% ownership interests in two apartment communities (633 homes) located in austin, texas for $11.7 million from its joint venture partner. in addition, the company also acquired two parcels of land for development in san francisco, california and boston, massachusetts for a total purchase price of $77.2 million.
capital expenditures total capital expenditures, which in aggregate include recurring capital expenditures and major renovations, of $90.1 million or $2,274 per stabilized home were spent on all of our communities, excluding development and commercial properties, for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to $145.2 million or $3,537 per stabilized home for the prior year.
the decrease in total capital expenditures was primarily due to a decrease in major renovations of 65.8% or $60.6 million. major renovations of $31.5 million or $796 per home were spent for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to $92.1 million or $2,244 per home for the prior year. the decrease is primarily attributable to our 27 seventy five mesa
37
verde project in orange county, which incurred a full year of major renovation costs in 2013. the renovation project was completed in the second quarter of 2014.

we will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment in excess of our cost of capital. our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also achieving cap rate compression through asset quality improvement. recurring capital expenditures during 2015 are projected to be approximately $1,150 per home.
real estate under development and redevelopment at december 31, 2014, our development pipeline for one wholly-owned community totaled 369 homes with a budget of $217.7 million, in which we have a carrying value of $177.6 million. the estimated completion date for this community is in the second quarter of 2015. during 2014, we incurred $251.5 million for development costs, a decrease of $29.1 million from our 2013 level of $280.6 million.

consolidated joint ventures in december 2013, the company consolidated its 95%/5% development joint ventures 13th and market in san diego, california and domain college park in metropolitan, d.c. the consolidation was due to the company becoming the managing partner of each of the joint ventures pursuant to amendments to the llc agreements. in connection with the amendments, our partner received equity distributions reducing its capital account balances to zero, the company replaced our partner as the managing partner, and our partner no longer has the ability to substantively participate in the decision-making process, with only protective rights remaining. we accounted for the consolidations as asset acquisitions since the joint ventures were under development and not complete at the time of consolidation resulting in no gain or loss upon consolidation and increasing our real estate owned by $129.4 million and our debt owed by $63.6 million. in addition pursuant to the amendments, the company paid a non-refundable deposit to our partner in january 2014 of $2.0 million for each joint venture, or $4.0 million in total, for the right to exercise options in 2014 to acquire our partner's upside participation in the joint ventures. the non-refundable deposits were applied towards the total purchase price of approximately $24.7 million when the company acquired 100% of the interest in the joint ventures in november 2014.
in december 2014, the company sold a 49% interest in 13th and market to metlife for $54.2 million, resulting in a gain, net of tax, of $7.2 million. additionally, the company sold a 50% interest in a wholly owned land parcel to metlife for $8.3 million, resulting in a loss, net of tax, of $2.2 million. as a result, the company no longer controls these two joint ventures and they were deconsolidated by the company in december 2014.

(a)   in january 2012, the company formed a joint venture with an unaffiliated third party to acquire 399 fremont (land for future development) in san francisco, california, which is included in other udr/metlife joint ventures in the table above. at closing, udr owned a noncontrolling interest of 92.5% in the joint venture. the company's total investment was $55.5 million, which consisted of its initial investment of $37.3 million and an option to exercise its right to acquire its partner's 7.5% ownership interest in the joint venture. in october 2012, the company exercised its option and paid $13.5 million. in january 2013, the company subsequently acquired its partner's 7.5% ownership interest for $4.7 million. in december 2013, the company sold a 49% ownership interest to metlife in the fully-entitled 399 fremont land parcel for approximately $29.9 million. in conjunction with the sale, the company formed a new unconsolidated real estate joint venture with metlife, udr/metlife 399 fremont, to develop a $318 million, 447-home, luxury high-rise tower on the site. construction commenced in the first quarter 2014. as the company recently acquired the 399 fremont land parcel, the sale price was equivalent to the cost basis resulting in no gain or loss on the transaction. under the terms of the partnership, the company serves as the general partner with significant participating rights held by our partner, and has the ability to earn fees for development management, property management, asset management, and financing transactions. the udr/metlife 399 fremont joint venture is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. our initial investment was approximately $31.1 million.

in june 2013 and within udr/metlife i, the company exchanged with metlife its approximately 10% ownership interest in four operating communities and paid metlife an additional $15.6 million in cash for an increased ownership interest of approximately 35% in two high-rise operating communities, bringing udr's ownership interest in the two high-rise operating communities to 50% each. the two high-rise operating communities are located in denver, colorado and san diego, california and were subsequently contributed to udr/metlife ii. the four operating communities in which udr exchanged its ownership interest are located in washington d.c.; san francisco, california; dallas, texas; and charlotte, north carolina. udr continues to fee manage these four operating communities.
in march 2014, the company sold its minority ownership interests in two operating communities located in los angeles, california to metlife for cash proceeds of $3.0 million, which resulted in an immaterial gain. in april 2014, the company increased its ownership interest in the remaining six operating communities in the udr/metlife i joint venture from 12% to 50%, and metlife and the company contributed the communities to the udr/metlife ii joint venture. the company paid metlife $82.5 million for the additional ownership interests. the company continues to fee manage the operating communities that were contributed to the udr/metlife ii joint venture as well as the two operating communities in which it sold its minority ownership interests.
in july 2014, the company increased the ownership interest in two land sites in udr/metlife i to 50.1% and formed individual asset joint ventures, which are included in other udr/metlife joint ventures in the table above. the remaining 49.9% continues to be held by our joint venture partner metlife. the company paid metlife approximately $21.5 million for the additional ownership interests.
in december 2014, the company increased its ownership interest in one land site in the udr/metlife i joint venture to 50%. additionally, the company increased its ownership interest in another land site to 50.1%, which metlife and the company contributed to a separate joint venture and is included in other udr/metlife joint ventures in the table above. the company paid metlife approximately $15.3 million for the additional ownership interests. as of december 31, 2014, the remaining assets in the udr/metlife i joint venture were comprised of three potential development land sites in which the company has an average ownership interest of approximately 5% and one fully entitled land parcel in which the company owns 50%.
in december 2014, the company sold a 49% interest in 13th and market located in san diego, california to metlife for gross proceeds of $54.2 million, resulting in a gain, net of tax, of $7.2 million and a 50% interest in 3033 wilshire in los angeles, california, also to metlife for gross proceeds of $8.3 million, resulting in a loss, net of tax, of $2.2 million.
(b)   the number of apartment homes for the communities under development presented in the table above is based on the projected number of total homes. as of december 31, 2014, no apartment homes had been completed in other udr/metlife joint ventures.
(c)   in june 2013, the company sold a 50% interest in five partnerships (the "udr/metlife vitruvian park® partnerships") to metlife for approximately $141.3 million. the transaction resulted in a gain of approximately $436,000 which the company has deferred until the terms of the construction completion guarantee have been met. under the terms of the udr/metlife vitruvian park® partnerships, the company serves as the general partner with significant participating rights held by our partner, and earns fees for property management, asset management, and financing transactions. the udr/metlife vitruvian park® partnerships are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. our initial investment was approximately $80.2 million, which consisted of approximately $140.0 million (50% of our net book value of the real estate at the time of the transaction) reduced by our share of the net proceeds received upon encumbering the assets of approximately $58.7 million and other operating adjustments.
at closing, a total of $118.3 million of secured debt was placed on the two operating communities and the community under development. the debt on the two operating communities carries an interest rate of 4.0% with a term of ten years and the non-recourse construction loan on the community under development carries an interest rate of libor plus 175 basis points with a term of two years and two one-year extension options. the company has guaranteed the completion of the construction of the development. proceeds from the construction loan will be used for completion of construction of the development. upon completion, at its 50% ownership, the company's pro-rata share of the undepreciated book value of the udr/metlife vitruvian park® partnerships' real estate assets and outstanding debt will be approximately $145.0 million and $62.8 million, respectively.

(d) udr is a partner with an unaffiliated third party, which formed a joint venture for the investment of up to $450 million in multifamily properties located in key, high barrier to entry markets. the partners will contribute equity of $180 million of which the company's maximum equity will be 30% or $54 million when fully invested.
(e) in november 2007, udr and an unaffiliated third party formed a joint venture to own and operate 10 communities located in texas. udr contributed cash and property equal to 20% of the fair value of the joint venture. during the year ended december 31, 2012, the company acquired the remaining 80% ownership interests in two communities in austin, texas for $11.7 million. the company's investment in the joint venture at december 31, 2014 and 2013 was net of deferred profits on the sale of depreciable properties to the joint venture of $23.9 million and $24.0 million, respectively.
in january 2015, the eight communities held by the texas joint venture were sold, generating proceeds to udr of $43.5 million. the company recorded promote and fee income of approximately $9.6 million and a gain of approximately $59.1 million (including $24.2 million of previously deferred gains) in connection with the sale.
(f) in october 2013, the company entered into a participating debt financing arrangement with a third party that is developing a $108 million, 218-home, high-rise luxury community located adjacent to the cherry creek mall in denver, colorado. under the agreement, udr will finance up to 85%, or approximately $92.0 million, of the development cost at an interest rate of 6.5% per annum on the outstanding debt balance. in addition, the company has the option to purchase the community upon completion of construction and has a 50% participating interest in the profit upon the acquisition of the community or sale to a third party. the company accounts for the arrangement consistent with an investment in real estate under the equity method of accounting.
as of december 31, 2014, and 2013, our participating loan investment was $62.7 million and $14.3 million, respectively, which was included in investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures, net on the consolidated balance sheets. we also recognized $2.4 million and $156,000 of income included in income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities on the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
dispositions during the year ended december 31, 2014, the company recognized gains on the sale of real estate, net of tax, of $143.6 million. the company sold nine communities consisting of a total of 2,500 apartment homes, an adjacent parcel of land, and one operating property for gross proceeds of $328.4 million, resulting in net proceeds of $324.4 million and a total gain, net of tax, of $138.6 million. the company also sold 49% interest in a recently completed development for gross proceeds of $54.2 million, resulting in a gain, net of tax, of $7.2 million, and 50% interest in a land parcel for gross proceeds of $8.3 million, resulting in a loss, net of tax, of $2.2 million. a portion of the sale proceeds was designated for tax-deferred exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code and was used to fund acquisitions of real estate as discussed above.
in 2013, udr sold two apartment communities in the sacramento market, consisting of 914 apartment homes for gross proceeds of $81.1 million. udr recognized gains of $41.9 million, which are included in income/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax on the udr consolidated statements of operations. proceeds were used primarily to fund development and redevelopment activity and reduce debt.
in 2012, udr sold 21 apartment communities, which had 6,507 apartment homes for gross proceeds of $609.4 million. udr recognized gains (before tax) of $260.4 million, which are included in income/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax on the udr consolidated statements of operations. proceeds were used primarily to fund development and redevelopment activity and reduce debt.
we plan to continue to pursue our strategy of exiting markets where long-term growth prospects are limited and redeploying capital to primary locations in markets we believe will provide the best investment returns.
financing activities for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities was $(113.7) million, $(198.6) million and ($116.0) million, respectively.
the following significant financing activities occurred during the year ended december 31, 2014:
•   repaid $81.0 million of secured debt;
42
•   repaid $184.0 million of 5.13% unsecured medium-term notes due january 2014;
•   repaid $128.5 million of 5.50% unsecured medium-term notes due april 2014;
•   issued $300.0 million of 3.750% senior unsecured medium-term notes due july 2024;
•   sold 3,410,433 shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $99.8 million after deducting related expenses;
•   net borrowings of $152.5 million under the company's $900 million unsecured revolving credit facility; and
•   paid distributions of $256.1 million to our common stockholders.
the following significant financing activities occurred during the year ended december 31, 2013:
•   issued $300 million of 3.70% senior unsecured medium-term notes due october 2020;
•   repaid $46.6 million of secured debt. the $46.6 million of secured debt included $42.2 million of mortgage payments and the repayment of $4.4 million of credit facilities;
•   repaid $122.5 million of 6.05% unsecured medium-term notes due june 2013; and
•   re-priced our $100 million and $250 million unsecured term notes from libor plus 142.5 basis points to libor plus 125 basis points, and extended the maturity dates from january 2016 to june 2018.
credit facilities as of december 31, 2014, we have secured credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of $834.3 million, all of which was outstanding. the fannie mae credit facilities mature at various dates from may 2017 through july 2023, and bear interest at floating and fixed rates. the company has $568.1 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 5.12% and the remaining balance of $266.2 million on these facilities had at a weighted average variable rate of 1.60% at december 31, 2014.
as of december 31, 2014, the company has a $900 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in december 2017. the credit facility has a six month extension option and contains an accordion feature that allows us to increase the facility to $1.45 billion. based on the company's current credit rating, the credit facility carries an interest rate equal to libor plus a spread of 100 basis points and a facility fee of 15 basis points. as of december 31, 2014, we had $152.5 million of outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, leaving $747.5 million of unused capacity (excluding $1.9 million of letters of credit at december 31, 2014).
the fannie mae credit facilities and the bank unsecured revolving credit facility are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations. as of december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under these credit facilities.
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced. we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets. interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities. our earnings are affected as changes in short-term interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt. we had $579.7 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31, 2014. if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points, our interest expense would increase by $6.9 million based on the average balance outstanding during the year.
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost. these analysis do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. however, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure.
the company also utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges. see note 13, derivatives and hedging activities, in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional discussion of derivate instruments.

funds from operations, funds from operations as adjusted, and adjusted funds from operations funds from operations funds from operations ("ffo") is defined as net income (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in non-consolidated investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee, gains or losses from sales of depreciable property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. this definition conforms with the national association of real estate investment trust's ("nareit") definition issued in april 2002 and is comparable to ffo, diluted in the accompanying reconciliation. historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. thus, nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of a reit's operating performance. in the computation of diluted ffo, op units, unvested restricted stock, stock options, and the shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive; therefore, they are included in the diluted share count.
activities of our trs include development and land entitlement. from time to time, we develop and subsequently sell a trs property which results in a short-term use of funds that produces a profit that differs from the traditional long-term investment in real estate for reits. we believe that the inclusion of these trs gains in ffo is consistent with the standards established by nareit as the short-term investment is incidental to our main business. trs gains on sales, net of taxes, are defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation.
we consider ffo a useful metric for investors as we use ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance, and believe that ffo should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with gaap. ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs.
funds from operations as adjusted ffo as adjusted is defined as ffo excluding the impact of acquisition-related costs and other non-comparable items including, but not limited to, prepayment costs/benefits associated with early debt retirement, gains on sales of marketable securities and trs property, deferred tax valuation allowance increases and decreases, casualty-related expenses and recoveries, severance costs and legal costs. management believes that ffo as adjusted is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results with other reits.
ffo as adjusted is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. we believe that net income attributable to udr, inc. is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ffo as adjusted. however, other reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffo as adjusted or similar ffo measures and, accordingly, our ffo as adjusted may not always be comparable to ffo as adjusted or similar ffo measures calculated by other reits. ffo as adjusted should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with gaap) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with gaap) as a measure of our liquidity.
adjusted funds from operations adjusted ffo, or "affo", is a non-gaap financial measure that management uses as a supplemental measure of our performance. affo is defined as ffo as adjusted less recurring capital expenditures that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain functionality at our communities. therefore, management considers affo a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the company's operational performance than ffo or ffo as adjusted.
affo is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. we believe that net income attributable to udr, inc. is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to affo. management believes that affo is a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits, and presenting affo will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other reits. however, other reits may use different methodologies for calculating affo and, accordingly, our affo may not always be comparable to affo calculated by other reits. affo should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with gaap) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined
44
in accordance with gaap) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.

results of operations the following discussion explains the changes in results of operations that are presented in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, and includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented.
net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders
2014 -vs- 2013
net income attributable to common stockholders was $150.6 million ($0.59 per diluted share) for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to net income of $41.1 million ($0.16 per diluted share) for the prior year. the increase in net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december 31, 2014 resulted primarily from the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report:
•   gains, net of tax, of $143.6 million on the sale of real estate during the year ended december 31, 2014. these gains consisted of:
•   the sale of nine communities with a total of 2,500 apartment homes, an adjacent parcel of land, and one operating property for gross proceeds of $328.4 million, resulting in a gain, net of tax, of approximately $138.6 million; and
•   the sale of 49% interest in a recently completed development for gross proceeds of $54.2 million, resulting in a gain, net of tax, of $7.2 million and 50% interest in a land parcel for gross proceeds of $8.3 million, resulting in a loss, net of tax, of $2.2 million.
46
•   an increase in total property net operating income ("noi") primarily due to higher occupancy and higher revenue per occupied home, and noi from the homes placed in service related to development and redevelopment projects completed in 2014 and 2013, partially offset by the disposition of communities in 2014 and 2013.
this was partially offset by:
•   an increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily from the homes placed in service related to development and redevelopment projects completed in 2014 and 2013, partially offset by a decrease from sold communities and fully depreciated assets; and
•   casualty-related recoveries in 2013 resulting from the effects of hurricane sandy on three of our new york city communities in 2012 (see note 4, real estate owned, in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements for more details);
2013 -vs- 2012
net income attributable to common stockholders was $41.1 million ($0.16 per diluted share) for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to net income of $203.4 million ($0.85 per diluted share) for the prior year. the decrease in net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december 31, 2013 resulted primarily from the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report:
•   a decrease in net gains of $218.5 million on the sale of depreciable property related to the disposition of two communities in 2013 as compared to 21 communities in 2012; and
•   a decrease of $23.0 million in tax benefit primarily due to the reversal of our tax valuation allowance during 2012.
this was partially offset by:
•   an increase in total property noi primarily due to higher occupancy and higher revenue per occupied home partially offset by the disposition of 21 communities in 2012;
•   casualty-related recoveries in 2013 resulting from the effects of hurricane sandy on three of our new york, new york communities in 2012 (see note 16, casualty-related (recoveries)/charges, in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report for more details);
•   a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense primarily from the disposition of assets in 2012 and intangible assets related to in place leases acquired in 2011 and 2012 becoming fully amortized in 2012, which was partially offset by the depreciation from developed and redeveloped units placed in service in 2012 and 2013;
•   a decrease in loss from unconsolidated entities primarily due to an $8.3 million gain ($5.3 million net of tax expense) on the sale of our 95% interest in the lodge at stoughton; and
•   a decrease in interest expense due to lower average debt balances, lower average interest rates, and higher capitalized interest from development and redevelopment activities.
apartment community operations our net income results are primarily from noi generated from the operation of our apartment communities. the company defines noi, which is a non-gaap financial measure, as rental income less direct property rental expenses. rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing. excluded from noi is property management expense which is calculated as 2.75% of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations and land rent.
although the company considers noi a useful measure of a operating performance, noi should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap. noi excludes several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of noi to net income/(loss) attributable to udr, inc. below.

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 6.7% or $3.9 million increase in real estate tax and a 4.6% or $2.0 million increase in personnel costs, which was partially offset by a 4.2% or $1.3 million decrease in repair and maintenance expense.
as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property net operating income divided by property rental income) increased to 69.2% for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to 68.5% for 2012.
non-mature communities/other
2014 -vs- 2013
the remaining $115.5 million or 20.8% of our total noi for the year ended december 31, 2014 was generated from our non-mature communities/other. udr's non-mature communities/other consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same-store communities, which includes communities developed or acquired, redevelopment properties, sold or held for sale properties, and non-apartment components of mixed use properties. noi from non-mature communities/other increased by 21.8% or $20.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013. the increase was primarily driven by a increase in noi of 438.5% or $21.6 million from development communities and 25.8% or $9.3 million from redevelopment communities completed in 2014 and 2013, which was partially offset by an decrease in noi of 50.8% or $14.6 million from communities sold in 2014 and 2013.

interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2014, interest expense increased by 3.5% or $4.4 million as compared to 2013. the increase in interest expense was primarily due lower capitalized interest from development and redevelopment activities.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, interest expense decreased 9.2% or $12.7 million as compared to 2012. the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower debt balances and lower interest rates and higher capitalized interest from development and redevelopment activities.
tax benefit/(provision), net income taxes for our trs are accounted for under the asset and liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date.
the company recognized a tax benefit/(provision), net of $15.1 million, $7.3 million and $30.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase from 2013 to 2014 is primarily attributable to a one-time benefit of $5.8 million related to the conversion of certain taxable reit subsidiaries into reits in 2014. the decrease from 2012 to 2013 was primarily attributable to the reversal of a $21.5 million net deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2012. prior to 2012, our trs had a history of losses and, as a result, had historically recognized a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets. each quarter, the company evaluates the need to retain all or a portion of the valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets. in the first quarter of 2012, the company determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets, including any remaining net operating losses, will be realized. in making this determination, the company analyzed, among other things, its recent history of earnings, forecasts of future earnings from sales of depreciable property, and its cumulative earnings for the last twelve quarters.

interest and other income/(expense), net for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized interest and other income/(expense), net of $11.9 million, $4.6 million, and $3.5 million, respectively. the increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 and 2012 was primarily attributable to the net gain of $8.4 million realized on the repayment of a note receivable in 2014.

inflation we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities and material costs, the majority of our leases are for a term of fourteen months or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2014.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty. estimates are prepared based on management's assessment after considering all evidence available. changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations. below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required. a discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in note 2, significant accounting policies, to the notes to the operating partnership's consolidated financial statements included in this report.
cost capitalization in conformity with gaap, we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset. expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred.
in addition, we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment, development, and redevelopment of a capital project, which include, but are not limited to, interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects. we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for lease-up, the operating partnership ceases capitalization on the related portion. the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned, net of accumulated depreciation. amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, were $4.9 million, $8.4 million, and $5.8 million, respectively.

impairment of long-lived assets we record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets. our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value. our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates, operating costs, growth rates, discount rates, capitalization rates, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.
real estate investment properties we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components, such as land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place leases, based on the fair value of each component. in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize various sources, including independent appraisals, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates. as such, the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial lease-up period. we determine the fair value of in-place leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition. in addition, we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases, the foregone rents associated with the lease-up period, and the carrying costs associated with the lease-up period. the fair value of in-place leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period.

(a)   monthly income per occupied home represents total revenues divided by the product of occupancy and the number of mature apartment homes.
we report in two segments: same-store communities and non-mature communities/other.
our same-store communities segment represents those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to january 1, 2013 and held as of december 31, 2014. these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the communities are not classified as held for sale at year end. a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months.
our non-mature communities/other segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same-store communities, including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties.

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows, the sale of properties, and the issuance of debt. both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity. the operating partnership's primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates, occupancy levels, and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner's credit agreements. the general partner will routinely use its unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longer-term financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities. during the past several years, proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio.
we expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner's credit agreements. we expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities and potential property acquisitions through borrowings and the disposition of properties. we believe that our net cash provided by operations and borrowings will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of distributions. likewise, the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations, and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner's credit agreements.
future capital needs future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the issuance of secured debt or unsecured debt, sales of properties, borrowings allocated to us under our general partner's credit agreements, and to a lesser extent, from cash flows provided by operating activities.
as of december 31, 2014, the operating partnership had approximately $193.0 million of principal payments on secured debt maturing in 2015. we anticipate that we will repay that debt with operating cash flows or proceeds from borrowings allocated to us under our general partner's credit agreements. the repayment of debt will be recorded as an offset to the advances (to)/from general partner.
statements of cash flows the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities, net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities, and net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012.
operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2014, net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities was $208.0 million compared to $208.3 million for 2013. the increase in cash flow due to improved income from continuing operations was offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities was $208.3 million compared to $201.1 million for 2012. the increase in net cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in property net operating income from our apartment community portfolio and changes in operating assets and operating liabilities.
investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014, net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities was $(46.7) million compared to $(64.0) million for 2013. the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to lower spend on development and redevelopment.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities was $(64.0) million compared to $4.3 million for 2012. changes in the level of investment activities from period to period reflect our strategy as it relates to acquisitions, dispositions, development, redevelopment, and capital expenditures.
disposition of investments during the year ended december 31, 2014 the operating partnership sold one community and an adjacent parcel of land in san diego, california for gross proceeds of $48.7 million, resulting in a $24.4 million gain and net proceeds of $47.9
56
million. the operating partnership also recorded gains of $39.2 million in connection with udr's sale of two communities in tampa, florida and los angeles, california, which were previously deferred. the total gains of $63.6 million were included in gain/(loss) on sale of real estate owned on the consolidated statements of operations.
in 2013, the operating partnership sold two apartment communities in the sacramento market, consisting of 914 apartment homes for gross proceeds of $81.1 million. the operating partnership recognized a gain of $41.5 million, which is included in income/(loss) from discontinued operations on the operating partnership's consolidated statements of operations. proceeds were used primarily to fund development and redevelopment activity and reduce debt.
also in 2013, the operating partnership distributed the development property los alisos to the general partner as a capital distribution. upon the distribution of the property, the operating partnership redeemed 1,002,556 limited partnership units owned by udr and affiliated entities and reduced its receivable from the general partner by $53.7 million, resulting in a net capital reduction of $77.0 million.
in 2012, the operating partnership sold four communities with 1,314 apartment homes for a gain of $51.1 million.
financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014, net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities was $(162.8) million compared to $(145.3) million for 2013. the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to increased advances to the general partner, partially offset by decreased payments on secured debt and proceeds from the issuance of secured debt.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities was $(145.3) million compared to $(203.3) million for 2012. the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in payments on secured debt, a decrease in advances from the general partner, and a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of secured debt.
credit facilities as of december 31, 2014, an aggregate commitment of $526.6 million of the general partner's secured credit facilities with fannie mae was allocated to the operating partnership based on the ownership of the assets securing the debt. the entire commitment was outstanding at december 31, 2014. the fannie mae credit facilities mature at various dates from may 2017 through july 2023 and bear interest at floating and fixed rates. at december 31, 2014, $333.8 million of the outstanding balance was fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 4.90% and the remaining balance of $192.8 million on these facilities had a weighted average variable interest rate of 1.83%. during 2013, the general partner reallocated an additional $13.7 million of the fannie mae credit facilities to the operating partnership.
the operating partnership is a guarantor on the general partner's unsecured revolving credit facility, with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $900 million, $250 million of term notes due june 2018, $100 million of term notes due june 2018, $300 million of medium-term notes due june 2018, $300 million of medium-term notes due october 2020, $400 million of medium-term notes due january 2022, and $300 million of medium-term notes due july 2024. as of december 31, 2014, there were $152.5 million outstanding borrowings under the unsecured credit facility. as of december 31, 2013, there was no outstanding balance under the unsecured credit facility.
the credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations.
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced. we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets. interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities. our earnings are affected as changes in short-term interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt. we had $219.8 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31, 2014. if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points, our interest expense would increase by $2.2 million based on the balance at december 31, 2014.
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost. these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to
57
the change. however, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure.
the general partner also utilizes derivative financial instruments allocated to the operating partnership to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges. see note 8, derivatives and hedging activity, in the notes to the operating partnership's consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional discussion of derivative instruments.
results of operations the following discussion explains the changes in results of operations that are presented in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, and includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented.
net income(loss) attributable to op unitholders
2014 -vs- 2013
net income/(loss) attributable to op unitholders was $96.2 million ($0.53 per op unit) for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to $73.4 million ($0.40 per op unit) for the the prior year. the increase resulted primarily from the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report:
•   the operating partnership sold one community and an adjacent parcel of land in san diego, california for gross proceeds of $48.7 million, resulting in a $24.4 million gain and net proceeds of $47.9 million. the operating partnership also recorded gains of $39.2 million in connection with udr's sale of two communities in tampa, florida and los angeles, california, which were previously deferred;
•   an increase in total property net operating income ("noi") primarily due to higher occupancy and higher revenue per occupied home, and noi from the homes placed in service related to development and redevelopment projects completed in 2014 and 2013, partially offset by the disposition of communities in 2014 and 2013.
this was partially offset by:
•   casualty-related recoveries in 2013 resulting from the effects of hurricane sandy on two of our new york city communities in 2012 (see note 13, casualty-related (recoveries)/charges, in the notes to the operating partnership's consolidated financial statements for more details).
2013 -vs- 2012
net income/(loss) attributable to op unitholders was $73.4 million ($0.40 per op unit) for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to $44.0 million ($0.24 per op unit) for the prior year. the increase resulted primarily from the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report:
•   an increase in total property noi primarily due to higher occupancy and higher revenue per occupied home, partially offset by a decrease in noi due to the disposition of four communities in 2012;
•   a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense primarily from the disposition of assets in 2012, partially offset by the depreciation from developed or redeveloped units placed in service in 2013 and 2012;
•   casualty-related recoveries in 2013 resulting from the effects of hurricane sandy on two of our new york, new york communities in 2012 (see note 13, casualty-related (recoveries)/charges, in the notes to the operating partnership's consolidated financial statements included in this report for more details); and
•   a decrease in interest expense due to lower average debt balances, lower average interest rates, and higher capitalized interest from development and redevelopment activities.
this was partially offset by:
•   a decrease in net gains of $9.6 million on the sale of depreciable properties related to the disposition of two communities in 2013 as compared to four communities in 2012.
58
apartment community operations our net income results primarily from noi generated from the operation of our apartment communities. the operating partnership defines noi, which is a non-gaap financial measure, as rental income less direct property rental expenses. rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing. excluded from noi is property management expense which is calculated as 2.75% of property revenue to cover regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations and land rent.
although the company considers noi a useful measure of a operating performance, noi should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap. noi excludes several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of noi to net income/(loss) attributable to op unitholders below.

same-store communities
2014 -vs- 2013
our same-store community properties (those acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to january 1, 2013 and held on december 31, 2014) consisted of 19,010 apartment homes and provided 88.1% of our total noi for the year ended december 31, 2014.
noi for our same-store community properties increased 6.1% or $15.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in property noi was primarily attributable to a 4.8% or $17.2 million increase in property rental income, which was partially offset by a 1.9% or $2.0 million increase in operating expenses. the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 3.7% or $12.8 million increase in rental rates and a 4.0% or $1.1 million increase in reimbursement and fee income. physical occupancy increased 0.2% to 95.4% and total monthly income per occupied home increased by 4.6% to $1,713 for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013.
the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 4.2% or $1.5 million increase in real estate tax caused by higher real estate valuations and a 18.7% or $810,000 increase in insurance expense primarily caused by a higher volume of small claims, which was partially offset by a 2.3% or $367,000 decrease in repairs and maintenance costs.
as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property net operating income divided by property rental income) increased to 71.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 70.0% for 2013.
2013 -vs- 2012
our same-store community properties (those acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to january 1, 2012 and held on december 31, 2013) consisted of 18,616 apartment homes and provided 83.9% of our total noi for the year ended december 31, 2013.
noi for our same-store community properties increased 5.9% or $13.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 2012. the increase in property noi was primarily attributable to a 5.1% or $16.6 million increase in property rental income, which was partially offset by a 3.3% or $3.3 million increase in operating expenses. the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 4.3% or $13.7 million increase in rental rates and a 6.8% or $1.8 million increase in reimbursement and fee income. physical occupancy increased 0.2% to 95.8% and total monthly income per occupied home increased by 4.8% to $1,609 for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 2012.
the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 7.0% or $2.3 million increase in real estate tax and a 5.2% or $1.2 million increase in personnel costs, which was partially offset by a 3.1% or $502,000 decrease in repairs and maintenance costs.
60
as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property net operating income divided by property rental income) increased to 70.0% for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to 69.5% for 2012.
non-mature communities/other
2014 -vs- 2013
the remaining $35.7 million or 11.9% of our total noi during the year ended december 31, 2014 was generated from our non-mature communities/other. the operating partnership's non-mature communities/other consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same-store communities, which includes communities developed or acquired, redevelopment properties, sold properties, and non-apartment components of mixed use properties. noi from non-mature communities/other decreased 6.4% or $2.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in noi of 99.9% or $8.7 million from properties sold during 2014 and 2013, which was partially offset by an increase in noi of 27.2% or $1.2 million from commercial/other properties, and an increase of 41.3% or $4.2 million from redevelopment properties.
2013 -vs- 2012
the remaining $46.3 million or 16.1% of our total noi during the year ended december 31, 2013 was generated from our non-mature communities/other. the operating partnership's non-mature communities/other consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same-store communities, which includes communities developed or acquired, redevelopment properties, sold properties, and non-apartment components of mixed use properties. noi from non-mature communities/other decreased 13.7% or $7.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 2012. the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in noi of 45.8% or $4.7 million from properties sold during 2013 and 2012, a decrease in noi of 24.3% or $2.2 million from commercial/other properties, and a decrease of 6.2% or $1.2 million from redevelopment properties.
real estate depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31, 2014, real estate depreciation and amortization from continuing and discontinued operations decreased by 1.2% or $2.1 million as compared to 2013. the decrease in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31, 2014 was primarily from disposition of assets in 2014 and 2013, partially offset by the depreciation from developed and redeveloped units placed in service in 2014 and 2013.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, real estate depreciation and amortization from continuing and discontinued operations decreased by 7.0% or $13.7 million as compared to 2012. the decrease in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31, 2013 was primarily from the disposition of assets in 2012.
casualty-related recoveries/(charges), net in october 2012, hurricane sandy hit the east coast, affecting two of the operating partnership's operating communities (1,001 apartment homes) located in new york city. the properties suffered some physical damage, and were closed to residents for a period following the hurricane. the operating partnership has insurance policies that provide coverage for property damage and business interruption, subject to applicable retention.
based on the claims filed and management's estimates, the operating partnership recognized a $7.1 million impairment charge for the damaged assets' net book value and incurred $7.0 million of repair and cleanup costs during the year ended december 31, 2012. the impairment charge and the repair and cleanup costs incurred were reduced as of december 31, 2012 by $10.8 million of estimated insurance recovery, and were classified in casualty-related (recoveries)/charges, net on the consolidated statements of operations. during the year ended december 31, 2013, no material adjustments to the impairment charge and the repair and cleanup costs incurred were recognized. the rehabilitation of these two properties was substantially completed as of december 31, 2013.
as of december 31, 2013, the operating partnership had settled the hurricane sandy claims and received insurance proceeds in excess of the $10.8 million estimated insurance recovery receivable related to the impairment charge and the repair and cleanup costs incurred. as a result, the company recognized a casualty-related recovery of approximately $3.3 million and a casualty gain of approximately $582,000 for the year ended december 31, 2013. both the recovery and casualty gain were classified in casualty-related (recoveries)/charges, net on the consolidated statements of operations.
61
based on the claims filed and management's estimates, the operating partnership recognized $2.2 million of business interruption losses for the year ended december 31, 2012, of which $1.8 million were related to rent concession rebates provided to residents during the period the properties were uninhabitable and were classified in casualty-related (recoveries)/charges, net on the consolidated statements of operations, and $400,000 were related to rent that was not contractually receivable and were classified as a reduction to rental income on the consolidated statements of operations. the company estimates that it incurred an additional $2.1 million of business interruption losses for the year ended december 31, 2013. as noted, the company settled the hurricane sandy claims as of december 31, 2013.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, the operating partnership received approximately $4.2 million of insurance proceeds for recovery of business interruption losses. of the $4.2 million of insurance proceeds received during the year ended december 31, 2013, $2.1 million related to recovery of business interruption losses incurred in 2012 and the remaining $2.1 million related to recovery of business interruption losses incurred in 2013. the $4.2 million of recovery was included in casualty-related (recoveries)/charges, net on the operating partnership's consolidated statements of operations.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, the company recorded $541,000 of casualty-related losses due to property damage incurred during an earthquake and a storm in california, all of which are included in casualty-related (recoveries)/charges, net on the consolidated statements of operations.
interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2014, interest expense increased by 15.7% or $5.7 million as compared to 2013, which was primarily due to lower portion of interest capitalized in 2014 as a result of completed developments, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to replacement of debt at lower rates.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, interest expense decreased by 20.3% or $9.2 million as compared to 2012, which was primarily due to lower portion of interest capitalized in 2013 as a result of completed developments, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to replacement of debt at lower rates.
gain/(loss) on the sale of real estate owned for the year ended december 31, 2014, the operating partnership sold one community and an adjacent parcel of land in san diego, california for gross proceeds of $48.7 million, resulting in a $24.4 million gain and net proceeds of $47.9 million. the operating partnership also recorded gains of $39.2 million in connection with udr's sale of two communities in tampa, florida and los angeles, california, which were previously deferred.
due to the company's adoption asu 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity, effective january 1, 2014, these gains were included in gain/(loss) on sale of real estate owned on the operating partnership's consolidated statements of operations. see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the notes to the operating partnership's consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information.
for the years ended december 31, 2013, and 2012, we recognized gains on sale of depreciable property of $41.5 million, and $51.1 million, respectively. these gains are included in income/(loss) from discontinued operations on the operating partnership's consolidated statements of operations included in this report. changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our divestiture activity from period to period as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties sold.
net (income)/loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31, 2014, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $952,000 as compared to $4.6 million for 2013. the decrease of $3.6 million was primarily due to the operating partnership correcting an error in the general partner's ownership interest in one of the consolidated subsidiaries resulting in a cumulative adjustment recorded in 2013 of $3.3 million. management believes the impact of the cumulative adjustment in 2013 is immaterial to the financial statements taken as a whole.
inflation we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment
62
homes. although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2014.

item 1a.   risk factors risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
risks relating to the proposed biomet merger and the combined company following the merger the following risk factors relate to certain risks and uncertainties associated with the pending biomet merger and the combined company following the merger. the following discussion does not, however, contain all risks and uncertainties that relate to biomet and its business on a standalone basis, which additional risks and uncertainties may also affect our actual results and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations following the completion of the biomet merger.
there is no assurance when or if the merger will be completed. any delay in completing the merger may substantially reduce the benefits that we expect to obtain from the merger.
completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions. there can be no assurance that we and lvb will be able to satisfy the closing conditions or that closing conditions beyond our control will be satisfied or waived. we and lvb can agree at any time to terminate the merger agreement, even though lvb stockholders have approved the merger, and we and lvb can also terminate the merger agreement under other specified circumstances. if the merger and the integration of the companies respective businesses are not completed within the expected timeframe, such delay may materially and adversely affect the synergies and other benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the merger and could result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other effects associated with uncertainty about the merger.
we expect to incur substantial expenses related to the merger and the integration of biomet.
we expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the merger and the integration of biomet. there are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll, manufacturing, marketing and employee benefits. while we expect to incur integration and restructuring costs following completion of the merger in 2015 that are estimated to exceed $400 million in the first two years post-merger, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. these expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings. although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may offset incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time, we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all.
we and lvb may be unable to obtain the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger.
completion of the merger is conditioned upon, among other conditions, the expiration or termination of any waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, the approval of the european commission and the receipt of approval or expiration or termination of any waiting period under applicable antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar laws of japan. we and lvb are pursuing all required consents, orders and approvals in accordance with the merger agreement. these consents,
9
zimmer holdings, inc.   2014 form 10-k annual report orders and approvals may impose conditions on or require divestitures relating to our or biomets divisions, operations or assets, or may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined companys business. the merger agreement requires us and lvb, among other things, to accept all such conditions, divestitures, requirements, limitations, costs or restrictions that may be imposed by regulatory entities. such conditions, divestitures, requirements, limitations, costs or restrictions may jeopardize or delay completion of the merger, may reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger or may result in the abandonment of the merger. further, no assurance can be given that the required consents, orders and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, even if all such consents, orders and approvals are obtained and such conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents, orders and approvals.
the pendency of the merger could have an adverse effect on our and/or biomets business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.
the pendency of the merger could disrupt our and/or biomets businesses in the following ways, among others:
   our and/or biomets employees may experience uncertainty regarding their future roles in the combined company, which might adversely affect our and/or biomets ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel;

                                                      the attention of our and/or biomets management may be directed towards the completion of the merger and other transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of us and/or biomet, as applicable, and matters related to the merger may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial to us and/or biomet, as applicable; and

                               customers, suppliers and other third parties with business relationships with us and/or biomet may decide not to renew or may decide to seek to terminate, change and/or renegotiate their relationships with us and/or biomet as a result of the merger, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us and/or biomet or otherwise.

any of these matters could adversely affect the businesses of, or harm the financial condition, results of operations or business prospects of, us and/or biomet.
failure to complete the merger could negatively impact our future business and financial results.
if the merger is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected. we will be subject to several risks, including the following:
   having to pay certain costs relating to the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, filing and printing fees; and

   focusing our management on the merger instead of on pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us and our stockholders, without realizing any of the benefits of having the merger completed.

we cannot assure you that, if the merger is not completed, these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect our business and financial results.
successful integration of biomet with us and successful operation of the combined company are not assured. also, integrating our business with that of biomet may divert the attention of management away from operations.
if the merger is completed, biomet will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ours, but will initially continue its operations on a basis that is separate from our operations. there can be no assurance that after the merger biomet will be able to maintain and grow its business and operations. in addition, the market segments in which biomet operates may experience declines in demand and/or new competitors. integrating and coordinating certain aspects of the operations and personnel of biomet with ours will involve complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges. this process will be time-consuming and expensive, will disrupt the businesses of both companies and may not result in the full benefits expected by us and biomet, including cost synergies expected to arise from supply chain efficiencies and overlapping general and administrative functions. the potential difficulties, and resulting costs and delays, include:
   managing a larger combined company;

   consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;

   issues in integrating manufacturing, warehouse and distribution facilities, research and development and sales forces;

   difficulties attracting and retaining key personnel;

   loss of customers and suppliers and inability to attract new customers and suppliers;

   unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems;

   incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing, administration and other systems and processes; and

   unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the merger or biomets business.

additionally, the integration of our and biomets operations, products and personnel may place a significant burden on management and other internal resources. the diversion of managements attention, and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process, could harm the combined companys business, financial condition and operating results.
we will incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the merger and may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations.
in connection with the merger, we entered into a $7.66 billion bridge credit agreement and a $4.35 billion bank credit agreement. proceeds from the bank credit agreement and the anticipated issuance by us of up to $7.66 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (or, if senior unsecured notes are not issued and sold prior to the closing date of the merger, drawings under the bridge credit agreement) will be used to finance, in part, the cash consideration for the merger, pay fees and the expenses incurred in connection with the merger and pay off all of
10
zimmer holdings, inc.   2014 form 10-k annual report biomets funded debt. our debt outstanding as of december 31, 2014 was approximately $1.43 billion and, immediately after the completion of the merger, the combined companys debt is anticipated to be approximately $12.09 billion. as of december 31, 2014, our debt service obligations, comprised of principal and interest (excluding capital leases and equipment notes), during the next 12 months would, in the absence of the merger, have been approximately $64.0 million. as a result of the increase in debt related to the merger, demands on the combined companys cash resources will increase after the completion of the merger. the increased level of debt could, among other things:
   require the combined company to dedicate a large portion of its cash flow from operations to the servicing and repayment of its debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

   limit the combined companys ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

   limit the combined companys flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which we operate;

   restrict the combined companys ability to make strategic acquisitions or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities;

   place the combined company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt;

   adversely affect the combined companys credit rating, with the result that the cost of servicing the combined companys indebtedness might increase and its ability to obtain surety bonds could be impaired;

   adversely affect the market price of our common stock; and

   limit the combined companys ability to apply proceeds from an offering or asset sale to purposes other than the servicing and repayment of debt.

if we are unable to obtain alternate financing through senior unsecured notes, it is unlikely that we will be able to repay the outstanding amounts under the bridge loan at maturity on the 364th day after completion of the merger. any debt incurred to refinance the bridge loan may be on unfavorable terms.
the merger may cause dilution to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.
although we anticipate that the merger will have an immediate accretive impact on the combined companys adjusted earnings per share, this expectation is based on factors that may not be realized and estimates that may materially change. we could also encounter additional transaction-related costs or other factors, such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated to result from the merger. in addition, we expect that lvb stockholders and holders of lvb equity-based awards immediately prior to the merger will own, in the aggregate, approximately 16% of our outstanding shares after the merger, based on the number of outstanding shares of our common stock on december 31, 2014. once additional shares are issued in the merger, the combined companys earnings per share may be lower than our adjusted earnings per share would have been in the absence of the merger. all of these factors could cause dilution to earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger, and cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock. there can be no assurance that any increase in adjusted earnings per share will occur, even over the long term. any increase in adjusted earnings per share as a result of the merger is likely to require us, among other things, to successfully manage the combined companys operations to increase our consolidated earnings after the merger.
risks relating to our business regardless of whether the proposed biomet merger is consummated our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors.
we operate in a highly competitive environment. our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies, including biological therapies. to remain competitive, we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies. competition is primarily on the basis of:
   technology;

   innovation;

   quality;

   reputation; and

   customer service.

in markets outside of the u.s., other factors influence competition as well, including:
   local distribution systems;

   complex regulatory environments; and

   differing medical philosophies and product preferences.

our competitors may:
   have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us;

   respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies;

   undertake more extensive marketing campaigns;

   adopt more aggressive pricing policies; or

   be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.

any of these factors, alone or in combination, could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products.
if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.
our marketing success in the u.s. and abroad depends significantly upon our agents and distributors sales and service expertise in the marketplace. many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents detailed knowledge of products and instruments. a loss of a significant number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
11
zimmer holdings, inc.   2014 form 10-k annual report if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.
demand for our products may change, in certain cases, in ways we may not anticipate because of:
   evolving customer needs;

   changing demographics;

   slowing industry growth rates;

   declines in the reconstructive implant market;

   the introduction of new products and technologies;

   evolving surgical philosophies; and

   evolving industry standards.

without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time. if that happens, our revenue and operating results would suffer. the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:
   properly identify and anticipate customer needs;

   commercialize new products in a timely manner;

   manufacture and deliver instruments and products in sufficient volumes on time;

   differentiate our offerings from competitors offerings;

   achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products;

   satisfy the increased demands by healthcare payors, providers and patients for shorter hospital stays, faster post-operative recovery and lower-cost procedures;

   innovate and develop new materials, product designs and surgical techniques; and

   provide adequate medical education relating to new products.

in addition, new materials, product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly, in some or all markets, because of, among other factors:
   entrenched patterns of clinical practice;

   the need for regulatory clearance; and

   uncertainty with respect to third-party reimbursement.

moreover, innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production. in addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.
if third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels, the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed.
we sell our products and services to hospitals, doctors, dentists and other healthcare providers, all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from third-party payors, such as domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs. these third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. third-party payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices.
in addition, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. if third-party payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products, demand for our products may decline, or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets. if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products, our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected.
the u.s. healthcare reform law includes provisions that may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010, as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 (collectively, the affordable care act), was signed into law in march 2010 and mandates health insurance coverage and other healthcare reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018. as part of the affordable care act, in january 2013 we began paying a 2.3 percent medical device excise tax on the vast majority of our u.s sales. we continue to identify ways to reduce spending in other areas to offset the earnings impact due to the tax. we have not been able to pass along the cost of the tax to hospitals, which continue to face cuts to their medicare reimbursement under the affordable care act and other legislation. nor have we been able to offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion of health insurance coverage because of the demographics of the current uninsured population. the medical device excise tax regulations and subsequent guidance from the u.s. department of treasury have not lessened the burden of complying with the excise tax statute. in addition, without the implementation of proper safeguards, the affordable care acts medicare payment reforms, such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments, could provide additional incentives for healthcare providers to reduce spending on some of our medical device products and reduce utilization of hospital procedures that use our products. accordingly, while it is still too early to fully understand and predict the full impact of the affordable care act on our business, ongoing implementation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
the ongoing cost-containment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs. group
12
zimmer holdings, inc.   2014 form 10-k annual report purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organizations affiliated hospitals and other members. if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products, and, if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturers products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement. our failure to respond to the cost-containment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
we are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the medical devices we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all. delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs.
both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations. compliance with the fdas requirements, including the quality system regulation, recordkeeping regulations, labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations, is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda, which may result in observations on form 483, and in some cases warning letters, that require corrective action, or other forms of enforcement. if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the fda could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of payment of such devices, refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications, refuse to provide certificates to foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. the fda may also impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. the fda may also recommend prosecution to the u.s. department of justice. any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in 2012, we received a warning letter from the fda citing concerns relating to certain manufacturing and validation processes pertaining to trilogy acetabular system products manufactured at our ponce, puerto rico manufacturing facility. as of december 31, 2014, the warning letter remains pending. until the violations are corrected, we may become subject to additional regulatory action by the fda, the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval applications and/or the fda may refuse to grant export certificates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. additional information regarding this and other fda regulatory matters can be found in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements (see part ii, item 8 of this report).
our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, such as the international standards organization. if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our business could be harmed.
if we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
our industry is subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including the federal false claims act, the federal anti-kickback statute, the federal stark law, the federal physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign laws. violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the u.s., exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including medicare, medicaid and veterans administration (va) health programs. the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change.
we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the u.s., which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs.
we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived almost 50 percent of our net sales in 2014 from outside the u.s. we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally, including in emerging markets, which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations. our international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including:
   changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs;

   unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;

   differing local product preferences and product requirements;

   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

   diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the u.s.;

13
zimmer holdings, inc.   2014 form 10-k annual report
   trade protection measures and import or export requirements that may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and may increase our operating costs;

   foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the u.s.;

   complex data privacy requirements and labor relations laws;

   extraterritorial effects of u.s. laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act;

   effects of foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the uk bribery act;

   difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;

   labor force instability;

   potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and

   political and economic instability.

violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.
we may have additional tax liabilities.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the u.s., and any repatriation of funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates. in addition, there have been proposals to change u.s. tax laws that would significantly impact how u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.
we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can increase our costs, cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks.
a substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in europe and japan. the u.s. dollar value of our foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations. significant increases in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen, as well as other currencies, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities, and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial instruments, those actions may not prove to be fully effective.
pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation.
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. in the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients. as previously reported, we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the durom® acetabular component (durom cup) and certain products within the nexgen knee system. the majority of the durom cup cases are pending in a federal multidistrict litigation in the district of new jersey (in re: zimmer durom hip cup products liability litigation) and the majority of the nexgen knee system cases are pending in a federal multidistrict litigation in the northern district of illinois (in re: zimmer nexgen knee implant products liability litigation). we are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products. any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, can be costly to defend. product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.
although we maintain third-party product liability insurance coverage, we have substantial self-insured retention amounts that we must pay in full before obtaining any insurance proceeds to satisfy a judgment or settlement. furthermore, even if any product liability loss is covered by our insurance, it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and we would have to pay the amount of any settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy limits. product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights, and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.
claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our industry and are frequently time consuming and costly. at any given time, we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights
14
zimmer holdings, inc.   2014 form 10-k annual report against others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. we rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and non-disclosure and other agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we will continue to do so. while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, these patents, trade secrets and other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property. further, our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors, and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage. third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.
in addition, intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect in some foreign countries. if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property, our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired, which could limit our growth and revenue.
we also attempt to protect our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation with security measures, including the use of non-disclosure and other agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborators. we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.
we are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.
in addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits, we are involved in various commercial litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future. given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period.
we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect the integrity of our information systems and data, our business could be adversely affected.
we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure. as a result of technology initiatives, recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities. our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information. in addition, third parties may attempt to gain unauthorized access to our products or systems and may obtain data relating to patients or our proprietary information. if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other healthcare professionals, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach, or suffer other adverse consequences. while we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will be successful or that systems issues will not arise in the future. any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption, or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.
future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results.
our assets include intangible assets, primarily goodwill. the goodwill results from our acquisition activity and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired. we assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable. if the operating performance at one or more of our business units falls significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, or if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline, we could be required, under current u.s. accounting rules, to record a non-cash charge to operating earnings for the amount of the impairment. any write-off of a material portion of our unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations.
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials and outsourced activities.
we use a number of suppliers for raw materials that we need to manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing activities. these suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our quality and regulatory requirements. some key raw materials and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a
15
zimmer holdings, inc.   2014 form 10-k annual report single source or a limited number of sources. a prolonged disruption or other inability to obtain these materials or outsource key manufacturing activities could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products.
the conflict minerals rule may adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products, may increase our costs, cause our profitability to decline and harm our reputation.
we are subject to the secs rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals (tantalum, tin and tungsten (or their ores) and gold), which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries. we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on june 2, 2014 and are required to file on an annual basis going forward. this rule could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products, which could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability. in addition, we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule, including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products. we have a complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement. as a result, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders.
item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this form 10-k. certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes. certain amounts in the 2013 and 2012 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2014 presentation.
forward-looking financial information provided in this managements discussion and analysis does not include estimated results of operations, cash flows or financial position related to the pending biomet merger, except for certain costs and expenses we expect to incur that are necessary to consummate the merger and that we will incur for integration planning prior to the merger closing. the biomet merger is expected to be a transformational event for us and have significant effects on all aspects of our business. this managements discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations on a standalone basis is not indicative of the financial condition and results of operations for future periods on a combined company basis following the merger.
executive level overview
2014 results our 2014 sales results reflected increased growth as compared with 2013. sales from recent product introductions, such as persona the personalized knee system, as well as a stable joint replacement market, drove sales volume and product mix growth. this was partially offset by continued pricing pressure, negative effects from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and a year-over-year decline in sales of our transposal fluid waste management system.
despite the increase in net sales, net earnings decreased, driven by increased spending on our operational excellence initiatives, integration planning expenses related to the pending biomet merger, a $70.0 million contingent legal liability recognized in 2014, and increased debt issuance costs and unused commitment fees recognized on new debt facilities that we entered into in may 2014 in order to fund the pending biomet merger.
2015 outlook the pending biomet merger, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2015, will have a significant impact on our 2015 operating results. this report does not include guidance for 2015 on a combined company basis.
however, for zimmer on a standalone basis, we project that our net sales will face significant headwinds from the u.s. dollar strengthening against the euro, japanese yen and various other currencies around the world based upon recent foreign currency exchange rates. additionally for net sales, we expect to experience volume and mix growth from a stable joint replacement market and continued pricing pressure.
in regards to expenses on a zimmer standalone basis, due to our hedging program, we project that the expected decrease in net sales caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates will be partially offset by hedge gains to be recognized in 2015. we expect research and development (r&d) spending will remain similar compared to prior years as a percentage of net sales. for our selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses, we expect to continue to realize efficiencies from our operational excellence initiatives. however, since many of our fixed sg&a expenses are denominated in u.s. dollars, such as corporate and business unit headquarter expenses and intangible asset amortization, our sg&a expenses may not decrease in similar proportion to net sales decreases expected from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

demand (volume and mix) trends increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 4 percentage points of year-over-year sales growth in 2014, which was a lower growth rate than experienced in 2013 compared to 2012. in 2013, accelerated growth was fueled by the introduction of new products, such as persona the personalized knee system and the transposal fluid waste management system. in 2014, while new products continued to drive sales growth, their impact on a year-over-year basis was not as significant.
we believe long-term indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population, growth in emerging markets, obesity, proven clinical benefits, new material technologies, advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles, among other factors. in addition, demand for clinically proven premium products and patient specific devices are expected to continue to positively affect sales growth in markets that recognize the value of these advanced technologies.
pricing trends global selling prices had a negative effect of 2 percent on year-over-year sales during 2014. the negative 2 percent was consistent with prior years as we continued to experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems. for 2015, we expect continued pricing pressure similar to prior years.
foreign currency exchange rates for 2014, foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a 1 percent decrease in sales, driven by the strengthening of the u.s. dollar versus the japanese yen as well as a few other currencies in other regions in which we operate. if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with december 31, 2014 rates, we estimate that a stronger dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a greater negative effect on sales in 2015 than in 2014. we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk. changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to gains/losses on hedge contracts and options, which are recorded in cost of products sold, the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be partially offset.

zimmer holdings, inc.   2014 form 10-k annual report sales by product category knees knee sales increased 3 percent in 2014 compared to a 4 percent increase in 2013. our knee product category has benefited from recent product introductions, such as persona the personalized knee system and joint preservation solutions. however, the volume/mix growth from new product introductions has been tempered by pricing pressure in all our reporting segments.
in 2014, we continued a broader launch of persona the personalized knee system. we intend to continue to deploy implant and instrument sets for this knee system to all geographic regions in 2015 and beyond. our nexgen complete knee solution product line is still our leading global knee system in terms of sales. products driving growth in this category, in addition to persona the personalized knee system, included the zimmer unicompartmental high flex knee and our joint preservation solutions.
in europe, changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected knee sales in 2014 and 2013 by negative 1 percent and positive 2 percent, respectively. in asia pacific, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had negative effects on knee sales of 5 percent and 9 percent in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
hips hip sales were flat in 2014 after a decline of 1 percent in 2013. positive volume and mix trends continue to be offset by pricing pressure.
leading hip stem sales were the zimmer m/l taper hip prosthesis, the zimmer m/l taper hip prosthesis with kinectiv technology, the cls spotorno stem from the cls hip system, the alloclassic zweymüller hip stem and the fitmore hip stem. products experiencing growth in this category included the avenir müller stem, the wagner sl revision hip stem, the continuum acetabular system, the trilogy it acetabular system, the allofit it alloclassic acetabular system, vivacit-e highly crosslinked polyethylene liners and biolox delta heads.
in europe, changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected hip sales in 2014 and 2013 by negative 1 percent and positive 2 percent, respectively. in asia pacific, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had negative effects on hip sales of 6 percent and 11 percent in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
extremities extremities sales increased 5 percent in 2014 compared to an 11 percent increase in 2013. the sales increase in both years reflected growth from our shoulder systems, such as the zimmer trabecular metal reverse shoulder system and the sidus stem-free shoulder, and a broader product portfolio to compete in the foot and ankle and hand and wrist areas of the extremities category. the broader portfolio includes the zimmer trabecular metal total ankle and products from the acquisition of normed medizin-technik gmbh in june 2013.
dental dental sales increased 1 percent in 2014, which was the same as the prior year sales growth. increased sales of dental reconstructive implants and digital solutions have been partially offset by decreases in restorative products. sales were led by the tapered screw-vent implant system. in our dental product category, in certain markets, especially in our asia pacific region, our customers are distributors. the timing of distributor purchases can have a significant influence on sales in those markets in any particular year.
trauma trauma sales were flat in 2014 and increased by 2 percent in 2013. new product launches, especially in our europe and asia pacific reporting segments, positively affected sales in both years. the zimmer natural nail system and zimmer periarticular locking plates system led trauma sales.
spine spine sales increased 2 percent in 2014 after a decline of 3 percent in 2013. in 2014, we continued to focus on and had success in commercializing offerings across our core fusion portfolio and market adjacencies, including minimally invasive surgeries. solid sales of the pathfinder nxt minimally invasive pedicle screw system and trabecular metal technology products were partially offset by a decline in sales of other spine products.
surgical and other surgical and other sales declined by 5 percent in 2014 after an 18 percent sales increase in 2013. the primary cause of the sales fluctuations in this product category was the transposal fluid waste management system. this system is comprised of a capital equipment component that is used with a one-time use disposable manifold component. in 2013, our system benefitted from commercial disruption experienced by a competitive product, increasing demand for the capital equipment component. with that competitive product back on the market in 2014 and since many customers bought our capital equipment component in 2013, sales of the capital equipment component decreased significantly in 2014. however, this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of the related disposable manifold component. other products leading sales in this category were palacos bone cement, tourniquets and wound debridement devices.

the increase in gross margin percentage in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to significant excess and obsolete inventory charges recorded in 2013 related to products we intend to discontinue. we also recognized higher hedge gains in 2014 from our foreign currency hedging program compared to 2013. under the hedging program, for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged items affect earnings. further, we experienced improved product category mix, resulting in lower average costs per unit sold. these favorable items were partially offset by lower average selling prices and the u.s. medical device excise tax. while we began paying the medical device excise tax in 2013, based upon the levels of inventory we were carrying before the excise tax was effective on january 1, 2013, we did not recognize any significant expenses from the excise tax until the fourth quarter of 2013. we are in discussions with the internal revenue service (irs) as to what an appropriate constructive sales price used to compute our excise tax obligations should be under irs excise tax regulations and our specific business model. our ultimate medical device excise tax and liability may differ from the amount we have estimated. accordingly, the amount we have recognized as expense is an estimate and subject to change.
the decrease in gross margin in 2013 was primarily due to higher average costs per unit sold as a result of changes in product and geographic mix and increased excess and obsolescence charges related to products we intend to discontinue. additionally, lower average selling prices and certain inventory and manufacturing related charges connected to quality enhancement and remediation efforts reduced gross margin. these negative effects were partially offset by hedge gains recorded in 2013 from our foreign currency hedging program versus hedge losses recorded in 2012.
operating expenses r&d expenses and r&d as a percentage of sales have declined in the last three years. the lower spending reflected a natural decline from certain large projects that achieved commercialization, including persona the personalized knee system, and a dedication of resources to our quality and operational excellence initiatives. we expect r&d spending in 2015 to increase and be between 4 and 4.5 percent of sales as we transition our resources towards new projects as our quality and operational excellence initiatives continue to progress.
sg&a expenses have remained relatively consistent while sg&a as a percentage of sales has decreased over the last three years. improvement in sg&a expenditures as a percentage of sales reflects the effects of our operational excellence initiatives. although variable expenses naturally increase with higher sales, our sg&a expenses as a percentage of sales has decreased due to our operational excellence initiatives which produced lower variable and fixed costs in sg&a as net sales increased. additionally, selling and distribution expenses are lower in our europe and asia pacific reporting segments compared to our americas reporting segment. the mix of revenues with high sales growth in europe and asia pacific compared to the americas helped to lower sg&a as a percentage of sales in 2014 when compared to 2013.

certain claims expense is for estimated liabilities to durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries. we recorded additional expense of $21.5 million in 2014, bringing the total recorded expense to $420.3 million for these claims, excluding a subset of durom cup claims that were recorded in sg&a. the additional expense recorded in 2014 was the result of new developments related to international claims activity. for more information regarding these claims, see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2012, we noted that the carrying values of the net assets of our u.s. spine reporting unit were in excess of the reporting units estimated fair value. as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $96.0 million in 2012. we did not record a goodwill impairment charge in 2014 or 2013, as our annual goodwill impairment tests revealed that the carrying values of the net assets of our u.s. spine reporting unit were less than their estimated fair value. for more information regarding goodwill impairment and the factors that led to the 2012 impairment, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
special items have increased significantly in the past three years. the increase in 2014 was a result of higher professional fees related to the pending biomet merger, increased other professional fees, contract labor and dedicated project personnel related to our quality and operational excellence initiatives, increased intangible asset impairments and a $70.0 million accrual for a certain litigation matter. we continue to implement our quality and operational excellence initiatives, which are intended to improve our future operating results by centralizing or outsourcing certain functions and improving quality, distribution, sourcing, manufacturing and our information technology systems. special items expenses include consulting and professional fees, dedicated personnel costs, severance benefits as well as other costs for those programs. in addition to expenses for our quality and operational excellence programs, we recognize expenses related to integration of acquired businesses, impairment of assets, certain r&d agreements, certain litigation settlements, contract termination expenses and other items as special items. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding special items charges.
other expense, interest income, interest expense, and income taxes other expense represents debt issuance costs and unused commitment fees recognized for our senior credit facility and bridge credit agreement that we entered into in may 2014 in order to fund the pending biomet merger.
interest income and expense, net, was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 and 2012. in the second half of 2013, we entered into additional fixed-to-variable rate interest swaps designated as fair value hedges. in the 2014 periods, the variable rates we paid on the swaps were lower than the fixed rate on the hedged debt and, therefore, interest expense decreased.
our effective tax rate (etr) on earnings before income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was 23.8 percent, 22.6 percent and 24.0 percent, respectively. the variation of our etr has largely been affected by special items, certain claims, goodwill impairment charges and a $34.3 million benefit in 2012 from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to a legal entity restructuring. higher special items and certain claims expense favorably affect our etr because most of these expenses have been incurred within jurisdictions with higher tax rates, resulting in lower taxable income in these higher tax jurisdictions. goodwill impairment negatively affects our etr because no tax benefit is recorded on the charge. in 2014, a portion of our special items were for non-deductible expenses incurred related to the pending biomet merger, which increased our etr relative to 2013. in 2013, in addition to the effect of special items and certain claims, our etr benefited from the retroactive reinstatement of the r&d tax credit and other tax benefits applicable to us that applied to 2012 and 2013. due to the timing of the extension and the applicable rules of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap), we recognized the 2012 benefit in 2013. despite the $34.3 million benefit in 2012 from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to a legal entity restructuring, the 2012 etr was higher than 2014 and 2013 due to the goodwill impairment charge and lower certain claims and special items expenses. the items discussed accounted for the majority of the variation in our etrs in the past three years.
segment operating profit for our reporting segments, operating profit increased in europe and asia pacific in 2014 compared to 2013, while in the americas it decreased. the decrease in the americas was primarily from lower gross profit due to lower sales and the effect of the u.s. medical device excise tax. in europe, the increase in operating profit was driven by increased sales coupled with controlled operating expenses. operating expenses increased at a lower percentage compared to sales increases due to our operational excellence initiatives and the nature of fixed versus variable expenses resulting in operating margin expansion in europe. the increase in operating profit in asia pacific was driven by increases in sales from volume and product mix. while changes in foreign currency exchange rates tempered sales growth in asia pacific, this decline was largely offset by increased hedge gains recorded in 2014 versus 2013.
non-gaap operating performance measures we use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with gaap to evaluate our operating performance. these non-gaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory step-up, certain inventory and manufacturing related charges connected to quality enhancement and remediation efforts, certain claims, goodwill impairment, special items, other expenses related to financing obtained for the pending biomet merger and any related effects on our income tax provision associated with

liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,052.8 million in 2014, compared to $963.1 million in 2013. the principal source of cash from operating activities was net earnings. non-cash items included in net earnings accounted for another $346.4 million of operating cash in 2014. all other items of operating cash flows reflect a use of $12.6 million of cash in 2014, compared to a use of $84.9 million in 2013.
the increased cash flows provided by operating activities in 2014 were primarily due to improved cash flows generated from receivables collections, especially in europe, lower funding necessary for our u.s. pension plans, and receipt of insurance proceeds related to durom cup product liability claims. these favorable items were partially offset by higher tax payments for certain unresolved matters in order to limit the potential impact of irs interest charges and inventory investments.
at december 31, 2014, we had 64 days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable, which was 1 day less than at december 31, 2013. our days of sales outstanding reflect the reimbursement patterns of the healthcare industry in the markets where we compete. collection of trade accounts receivable is influenced by insurance reimbursements and government budgets, among other things. days of sales outstanding are lowest in our americas reporting segment, as the u.s. healthcare system has a higher percentage of private-pay insurers who generally pay more quickly than government-based healthcare systems. in our europe and asia pacific reporting segments, days of sales outstanding are higher, as healthcare is typically sponsored by governments which tend to pay more slowly. additionally, there are some seasonal trends in our days of sales outstanding as it usually trends higher in our third quarter due to lower sales volumes and is lower in our fourth quarter when sales volumes are at their highest. our days of sales outstanding in the past three years have ranged between 64 and 73 days. we were at the low end of this range as of december 31, 2014 due to improved collections in europe.
at december 31, 2014, we had 337 days of inventory on hand, an increase of 52 days compared to december 31, 2013. in order to maintain high service levels to our hospital customers in numerous geographic regions, we consign inventory to them, including all the various sizes of a particular product, so that our products are available when needed for a surgical procedure. as a result, we have a significant amount of inventory on hand. there are some seasonal trends in our days of inventory on hand, as it usually trends higher in our third quarter due to lower sales volumes and is lower in our fourth quarter when sales volumes are at their highest. other factors that can affect our days of inventory on hand include when we build inventory for new product launches, or the level of excess and obsolete inventory charges and gains/losses related to foreign currency that is reported in cost of products sold in any particular period. our days of inventory on hand in the past three years have ranged between 285 and 356 days. as of december 31, 2014, our days of inventory on hand were near the high end of this range. the higher inventory balance and days of inventory on hand were driven by the ongoing global commercialization of new product offerings, the effects of placing more inventory into distributor and hospital consignment and additional inventory in certain eastern european markets where we now have a direct sales presence instead of selling to a distributor.

zimmer holdings, inc.   2014 form 10-k annual report cash flows used in investing activities were $469.4 million in 2014, compared to $282.5 million in 2013. additions to instruments were relatively consistent between 2014 and 2013 as we continued to invest in instruments for significant product launches, such as persona the personalized knee system. spending on other property, plant and equipment increased in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting cash outlays necessary to complete new product-related investments and to replace older machinery and equipment. we invest some of our cash and cash equivalents in highly-rated debt securities. the purchases and any sales or maturities of these investments are reflected as cash flows from investing activities. the timing of these investments can vary from period to period depending on the maturity of the debt securities and other cash and cash equivalent needs. in the past three years, we have made a number of business acquisitions including etex holdings, inc., knee creations, llc, normed medizin-technik gmbh, dornoch medical systems, inc., and synvasive technology, inc.
cash flows used in financing activities were $562.4 million in 2014, compared to $467.3 million in 2013. in 2014, we returned cash to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends of $145.5 million and share repurchases of $400.5 million. in association with the debt facilities we entered into for the pending biomet merger, we incurred $64.1 million of debt issuance costs. in 2014, $250.0 million of our outstanding senior notes matured and were paid. additionally, financing cash flows continued to benefit from our increased stock price, with many employees exercising stock options.
in 2014, our board of directors declared cash dividends of $0.22 per share in each quarter. we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. the 2014 dividend declarations equated to an annualized rate of $0.88 per share, which represented a 10 percent increase over the 2013 annualized rate.
as of december 31, 2014, $599.5 million remained authorized under our $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which has no expiration date. due to the pending merger with biomet, we suspended repurchases after the first quarter of 2014. upon completion of the merger, in the near to medium term we intend to use our cash flows for debt repayment and dividends.
as discussed more completely in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, the irs has issued proposed adjustments for years 2006 through 2009 reallocating profits between certain of our u.s. and foreign subsidiaries. we have disputed these proposed adjustments and continue to pursue resolution with the irs. although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain, future payments may be significant to our operating cash flows.
also as discussed in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements, we have recorded a short-term liability of $50.0 million and long-term liability of $307.2 million related to durom cup product liability claims. we expect to continue paying these claims over the next few years. we expect to be reimbursed a portion of these payments for product liability claims from insurance carriers. we have received an initial amount of the insurance proceeds we estimate to recover. we have a long-term receivable of $170.3 million remaining for future expected reimbursements from our insurance carriers.
we expect to fund the $10.35 billion cash portion of the pending biomet merger with existing cash on hand, as well as proceeds to be obtained from a $3.0 billion 5-year unsecured term loan (term loan) and senior notes that we expect to issue. we have also entered into a $7.66 billion bridge credit agreement (bridge credit agreement) that may be used to fund the pending merger if we are unable to issue senior notes. the lenders commitments under the bridge credit agreement will be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of net cash proceeds we receive from the issuance of the senior notes.
currently, we have three tranches of senior notes outstanding: $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625 percent notes due november 30, 2019, $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375 percent notes due november 30, 2021 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75 percent notes due november 30, 2039. interest on each series is payable on may 30 and november 30 of each year until maturity.
we may redeem the senior notes at our election in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed; or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis at the treasury rate (as defined in the debt agreement), plus 20 basis points in the case of the 2019 and 2021 notes, and 25 basis points in the case of the 2039 notes. we will also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to the redemption date.
we have a senior credit facility (senior credit facility) that contains: (i) the 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $3.0 billion, and (ii) a 5-year unsecured multicurrency revolving facility (multicurrency revolving facility) in the principal amount of $1.35 billion. the senior credit facility replaces a previous credit agreement that provided for a $1.35 billion revolving credit facility that would have matured in may 2017. the multicurrency revolving facility will mature in may 2019, with two one-year extensions available at our option. borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility may be used for general corporate purposes. there were no borrowings outstanding under the multicurrency revolving facility as of december 31, 2014. the availability of the term loan is conditioned on, among other things, the consummation of the biomet merger. the term loan will mature five years after the initial borrowing. borrowings under the term loan may only be used by us to fund, in part, the biomet merger, including the payment of any indebtedness of lvb and its subsidiaries, and to pay all or a portion of the costs incurred by us in connection with the biomet merger. we must reduce unused commitments under the term loan and prepay the borrowings under the term loan with any net cash proceeds received from specified asset sales, issuances or sales of equity and incurrences of borrowed

zimmer holdings, inc.   2014 form 10-k annual report money indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions. the commitments under the term loan automatically terminate on the earliest to occur of (i) the funding and disbursement of term loan funds to us, (ii) april 24, 2015, as such date may be extended pursuant to the merger agreement or (iii) termination of the merger agreement.
we and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under the senior credit facility. borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at floating rates based upon indices determined by the currency of the borrowings plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term credit rating, or at an alternate base rate, or, in the case of borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility only, at a fixed-rate determined through a competitive bid process. the senior credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement, including, among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. financial covenants include a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda ratio of no greater than 3.0 to 1.0 in periods prior to any term loan funding and no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 in periods after the term loan is funded. if our credit rating falls below investment grade, additional restrictions would result, including restrictions on investments and payment of dividends. we were in compliance with all covenants under the senior credit facility as of december 31, 2014.
commitments under the senior credit facility are subject to certain fees. on the multicurrency revolving facility, we pay a facility fee at a rate determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term credit rating. on the term loan, we pay a fee on the daily actual unused commitment for the period from and including july 23, 2014 through the day the commitments under the term loan terminate.
the bridge credit agreement is a 364-day unsecured committed bridge facility in the principal amount of $7.66 billion. funding of loans under the bridge credit agreement is conditioned on, among other things, the consummation of the biomet merger. any loans under the bridge credit agreement will mature 364 days after the funding date of the loans. the bridge credit agreement requires us to reduce unused commitments and prepay the loans with any net cash proceeds received from specified asset sales, issuances or sales of equity and incurrences of borrowed money indebtedness, such as new senior notes we intend to issue, subject to certain exceptions. commitments under the bridge credit agreement automatically terminate on the earliest to occur of: (i) the funding and disbursement of the loans, (ii) april 24, 2015, as such date may be extended pursuant to the merger agreement, or (iii) termination of the merger agreement. proceeds of loans under the bridge credit agreement may only be used to fund, in part, the biomet merger, including the payment of any indebtedness of lvb and its subsidiaries, and to pay all or a portion of the costs incurred by us in connection with the biomet merger.
zimmer holdings is the borrower under the bridge credit agreement. borrowings under the bridge credit agreement bear interest at floating rates based upon libor plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term credit rating, or at an alternate base rate. the bridge credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement, including, among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. financial covenants include a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda ratio of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0. we were in compliance with all covenants under the bridge credit agreement as of december 31, 2014. if our credit rating falls below investment grade, additional restrictions would result, including restrictions on investments and payment of dividends.
we will pay a funding fee if we borrow under the bridge credit agreement as well as duration fees based on the outstanding principal amount of the loans in the amount and on the dates specified in the bridge credit agreement. in addition, we pay a fee on the daily actual unused commitment for the period from and including july 23, 2014 through the day the commitments under the bridge credit agreement terminate.
we have a term loan agreement with one of the lenders under the senior credit facility for 11.7 billion japanese yen (japan term loan) that will mature on may 31, 2018. borrowings under the japan term loan bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.61 percent per annum until maturity.
we also have other available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $31.9 million.
we currently have investment grade credit ratings from standard and poors ratings services (s&p) of a- and moodys investor services (moodys) of baa1. after the announcement of the biomet merger, s&p placed a creditwatch with negative implications on our rating and has indicated that it expects to lower our rating to bbb if the merger is completed. moodys placed our rating on review for downgrade and expects to lower our rating to baa3 if the merger is completed.
we place our cash and cash equivalents in highly-rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. we invest only in high-quality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy.
as of december 31, 2014, we had short-term and long-term investments in debt securities with a fair value of $868.9 million. these investments are in debt securities of many different issuers and, therefore, we believe we have no significant concentration of risk with a single issuer. all of these debt securities remain highly-rated and we believe the risk of default by the issuers is low.
as of december 31, 2014, $1,090.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments were held in jurisdictions outside of the u.s. and are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations. repatriation of these assets to the u.s. may have tax consequences. $844.0 million of this amount is denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, bears no foreign currency translation risk. the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate.
28
zimmer holdings, inc.   2014 form 10-k annual report management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the senior credit facility or from the public and private debt markets are sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs and to fund our pending merger with biomet, as well as return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends. should additional investment opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if necessary.
contractual obligations we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments. the following table illustrates our contractual obligations (in millions):
contractual obligations               total            2015          2016          2018            2020
and 2017      and 2019             and thereafter long-term debt                     $1,402.9              $            $        $602.9          $800.0

total contractual obligations      $2,913.3          $119.4        $347.5        $893.6        $1,552.8
$63.3 million of the other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet as of december 31, 2014 are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans. defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans; they are not based upon future contributions. due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions, we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2015. therefore, this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans.
also included in other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon. due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities, such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made. therefore, this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits. additionally, other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet include long-term deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to intangible assets acquired in business combinations and fixed assets. we have excluded these liabilities from this table as well, as they do not represent liabilities that will be settled in cash. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these tax-related accounts.
we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product r&d milestones, sales milestones, or, at our discretion, to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product. since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made, we have not included them in this table. these payments could range from $0 to $60 million.
critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. significant accounting policies which require managements judgment are discussed below.
excess inventory and instruments  we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost. similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply. accordingly, inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value. to determine the appropriate net realizable value, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components. the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work-in-process inventory, which is recorded at cost. obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off. management evaluates the need for changes to inventory and instruments net realizable values based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis.
income taxes - our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.
we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction. realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits. we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will be realized. federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the u.s.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances, including existing tax laws, our experience with previous settlement agreements, the
29
zimmer holdings, inc.   2014 form 10-k annual report status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters.
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards boards (fasb) guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
commitments and contingencies  accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported. we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims. historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model.
in addition to our general product liability, we have recorded provisions totaling $471.7 million related to the durom cup, including $21.5 million in 2014. see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the durom cup.
goodwill and intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. as such, these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs. changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets.
in the fourth quarter of 2012, we determined our u.s. spine reporting units carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value. fair value was determined using a weighting of income and market approaches. fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology, which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to our u.s. spine reporting unit.
as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the u.s. spine reporting unit of $96.0 million in 2012. see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to these impairment charges and the factors that could lead to further impairment. in 2014 and 2013, we employed a similar combination of income and market approaches to estimate this reporting units fair value and determined there were no impairment charges necessary. for our annual impairment test in 2014, the goodwill balance of the u.s. spine reporting unit was $41.0 million. due to improved operating performance of our u.s. spine reporting unit and improving macroenomic conditions, including higher valuation indicators used in our market approach, the u.s. spine reporting units estimated fair value was in excess of its carrying value of net assets by 24 percent for our 2014 impairment test. our international spine goodwill and related net assets are not tested separately for goodwill impairment as they are part of reporting units that contain other product categories.
we have four other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them. our 2013 annual impairment test indicated the estimated fair value of the u.s. dental reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value of net assets by 11 percent. for the annual impairment test in 2014, the goodwill balance of the u.s. dental reporting unit was $169.1 million. in our 2014 annual impairment test, due to improved operating performance and improving macroenomic conditions, including higher valuation indicators used in our market approach, the u.s. dental reporting units estimated fair value was in excess of its carrying value of net assets by 24 percent.
in 2014, for our three other reporting units annual impairment test, we performed a qualitative assessment of changes in fair value from the 2013 income approach. a qualitative assessment was performed because the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units was significantly in excess of the carrying value of its net assets in the 2013 impairment test.
share-based payment  we measure share-based payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period. determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock. additionally, we must estimate the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of actively traded options on our stock. the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors. the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent managements best estimates.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements to see how recent accounting pronouncements have affected or may affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

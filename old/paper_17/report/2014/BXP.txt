item 1a.   risk factors.

set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. we refer to the shares of our common stock and the units of limited partnership interest in bplp together as our securities, and the investors who own shares or units, or both, as our securityholders. this section contains forward-looking statements. you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 48.
our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.
our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of our securities, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our securityholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may adversely affect the income generated by our properties:
   downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions (particularly increases in unemployment);

   competition from other office, hotel, retail and residential buildings;

   local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, hotel, retail or residential space;

   changes in interest rates and availability of financing;

   vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space;

   changes in space utilization by our tenants due to technology, economic conditions and business culture;

   increased operating costs, including insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs;

   civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses or decrease the desirability to our tenants in impacted locations;

   significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property;

   declines in the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rents from our tenants; and

   decreases in the underlying value of our real estate.

we are dependent upon the economic climates of our marketsboston, new york, san francisco and washington, dc.
all of our revenue is derived from properties located in four markets: boston, new york, san francisco and washington, dc. a downturn in the economies of these markets, or the impact that a downturn in the overall national economy may have upon these economies, could result in reduced demand for office space. because our portfolio consists primarily of office buildings (as compared to a more diversified real estate portfolio), a decrease in demand for office space in turn could adversely affect our results of operations. additionally, there are submarkets within our markets that are dependent upon a limited number of industries. for example, in our washington, dc market we focus on leasing office properties to governmental agencies and contractors, as well as legal firms. a reduction in spending by the federal government could result in reduced demand for office space and adversely effect our results of operations. in addition, in our new york market we have historically
17
leased properties to financial, legal and other professional firms. a significant downturn in one or more of these sectors could adversely affect our results of operations.
in addition, a significant economic downturn over a period of time could result in an event or change in circumstances that results in an impairment in the value of our properties or our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset (1) is not recoverable over its expected holding period and (2) exceeds its fair value. there can be no assurance that we will not take charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets or investments. any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken.
our investment in property development may be more costly than anticipated.
we intend to continue to develop and substantially renovate office, retail and residential properties. our current and future development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks:
   we may be unable to proceed with the development of properties because we cannot obtain financing on favorable terms or at all;

                                   we may incur construction costs for a development project that exceed our original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased materials, labor, leasing or other costs, which could make completion of the project less profitable because market rents may not increase sufficiently to compensate for the increase in construction costs;

   we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project;

   we may abandon development opportunities after we begin to explore them and as a result we may lose deposits or fail to recover expenses already incurred;

   we may expend funds on and devote managements time to projects which we do not complete;

   we may be unable to complete construction and/or leasing of a property on schedule or at all; and

   we may suspend development projects after construction has begun due to changes in economic conditions or other factors, and this may result in the write-off of costs, payment of additional costs or increases in overall costs when the development project is restarted.

investment returns from our developed properties may be less than anticipated.
our developed properties may be exposed to the following risks:
   we may lease developed properties at rental rates that are less than the rates projected at the time we decide to undertake the development;

   operating expenses may be greater than projected at the time of development, resulting in our investment being less profitable than we expected; and

   occupancy rates and rents at newly developed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, and may result in our investments being less profitable than we expected or not profitable at all.

we face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties.
we operate, are currently developing, and may in the future develop, properties either alone or through joint ventures with other persons that are known as mixed-use developments. this means that in addition to the development of office space, the project may also include space for residential, retail, hotel or other commercial
18
purposes. we have limited experience in developing and managing non-office and non-retail real estate. as a result, if a development project includes a non-office or non-retail use, we may seek to develop that component ourselves, sell the rights to that component to a third-party developer with experience in that use or we may seek to partner with such a developer. if we do not sell the rights or partner with such a developer, or if we choose to develop the other component ourselves, we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate generally, but also to specific risks associated with the development and ownership of non-office and non-retail real estate. in addition, even if we sell the rights to develop the other component or elect to participate in the development through a joint venture, we may be exposed to the risks associated with the failure of the other party to complete the development as expected. these include the risk that the other party would default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other component ourselves (including providing any necessary financing). in the case of residential properties, these risks include competition for prospective residents from other operators whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks. we will also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent. because we have limited experience with residential properties, we expect to retain third parties to manage our residential properties. if we decide to not sell or participate in a joint venture and instead hire a third party manager, we would be dependent on them and their key personnel who provide services to us and we may not find a suitable replacement if the management agreement is terminated, or if key personnel leave or otherwise become unavailable to us.
we face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.
we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. we anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity. therefore, we are likely to need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as new equity capital, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant balloon payments come due. in addition, we may rely on debt to fund a portion of our new investments such as our acquisition and development activity. there is a risk that we may be unable to finance these activities on favorable terms or at all. these conditions, which increase the cost and reduce the availability of debt, may continue or worsen in the future.
we have agreements with a number of limited partners of bplp who contributed properties in exchange for partnership interests that require bplp to maintain for specified periods of time secured debt on certain of our assets and/or allocate partnership debt to such limited partners to enable them to continue to defer recognition of their taxable gain with respect to the contributed property. these tax protection and debt allocation agreements may restrict our ability to repay or refinance debt.
adverse economic and geopolitical conditions and dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions to you.
our business may be affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the u.s. economy or real estate industry as a whole, by the local economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located, including the continuing impact of high unemployment, and by international economic conditions. these current conditions, or similar conditions existing in the future, may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions as a result of the following, among other potential consequences:
   the financial condition of our tenants, many of which are financial, legal and other professional firms, may be adversely affected, which may result in tenant defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failures or for other reasons;

19
   significant job losses in the financial and professional services industries may occur, which may decrease demand for our office space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted;

            our ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt, reduce our returns from our acquisition and development activities and increase our future interest expense;

   reduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans;

                                                    the value and liquidity of our short-term investments and cash deposits could be reduced as a result of a deterioration of the financial condition of the institutions that hold our cash deposits or the institutions or assets in which we have made short-term investments, a dislocation of the markets for our short-term investments, increased volatility in market rates for such investments or other factors;

   one or more lenders under our line of credit could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms, or at all; and

   to the extent we enter into derivative financial instruments, one or more counterparties to our derivative financial instruments could default on their obligations to us, or could fail, increasing the risk that we may not realize the benefits of these instruments.

an increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets on favorable terms or at all.
as of february 23, 2015, we had no outstanding indebtedness, excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures, that bears interest at variable rates, but we may incur such indebtedness in the future. if interest rates increase, then so would the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders. further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or significantly increase our future interest expense. from time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts, including swaps, caps and floors. while these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us, they also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements will not perform, we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements, the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under guidance included in asc 815 derivatives and hedging. in addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amounts third-parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.
covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition.
the mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage. our unsecured credit facility, unsecured debt securities and certain secured loans contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including total debt to asset ratios, secured debt to total asset ratios, debt service coverage ratios and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt, which we must maintain. our continued ability to borrow under our credit facilities is subject to compliance with our financial and other covenants. in addition, our failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or be available only on unattractive terms. additionally, in the future our ability to satisfy current or prospective
20
lenders insurance requirements may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon greater insurance coverage against acts of terrorism or losses resulting from earthquakes than is available to us in the marketplace or on commercially reasonable terms.
we rely on debt financing, including borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, issuances of unsecured debt securities and debt secured by individual properties, to finance our existing portfolio, our acquisition and development activities and for working capital. if we are unable to obtain debt financing from these or other sources, or to refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected. if we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders can declare a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of the property securing the defaulted loan. in addition, our unsecured debt agreements contain specific cross-default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness, giving the unsecured lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances. defaults under our debt agreements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our common stock or debt securities.
on february 23, 2015, our total consolidated debt was approximately $9.9 billion (i.e., excluding unconsolidated joint venture debt). consolidated debt to total consolidated market capitalization ratio, defined as total consolidated debt as a percentage of the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our total consolidated debt, is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the reit sector. our total consolidated market capitalization was approximately $34.3 billion at february 23, 2015. total consolidated market capitalization was calculated using the closing stock price of $140.93 per common share and the following: (1) 153,187,903 shares of our common stock, (2) 16,442,774 outstanding common units of limited partnership interest in boston properties limited partnership (excluding common units held by us), (3) an aggregate of 1,639,695 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding ltip units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the ltip units, (4) 12,667 series four preferred units of partnership interest multiplied by the fixed liquidation preference of $50 per unit, (5) 80,000 shares (8,000,000 depositary shares, each representing 1/100th of a share), of our 5.25% series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock, at a price of $2,500 per share ($25 per depositary share) (6) 219,380 2012 opp units that were issued in the form of ltip units and earned as of february 6, 2015 and (7) our consolidated debt totaling approximately $9.9 billion. the calculation of total consolidated market capitalization does not include 312,585 2013 myltip units, 480,128 2014 myltip units and 372,007 2015 myltip units because, unlike other ltip units, they are not earned until certain return thresholds are achieved. our total consolidated debt, which excludes debt collateralized by our unconsolidated joint ventures, at february 23, 2015, represented approximately 28.87% of our total consolidated market capitalization. this percentage will fluctuate with changes in the market price of our common stock and does not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. however, for a company like ours, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, the consolidated debt to total consolidated market capitalization ratio may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as it is evaluated along with other financial ratios and the various components of our outstanding indebtedness.
our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by the three major rating agencies. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this rating, and in the event our senior debt is downgraded from its current rating, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and/or difficulty in obtaining additional financing. our degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally. there is a risk that changes in our debt to market capitalization ratio, which is in part a function of our stock price, or our ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts may have an adverse effect on the market price of our equity or debt securities.
21
we face risks associated with property acquisitions.
we have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties, including large portfolios that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:
   even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property, we may be unable to complete that acquisition after making a non-refundable deposit and incurring certain other acquisition-related costs;

   we may be unable to obtain or assume financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;

   acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;

   the actual costs of repositioning, redeveloping or maintaining acquired properties may be greater than our estimates;

   the acquisition agreement will likely contain conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction or other conditions that are not within our control, which may not be satisfied;

       acquired properties may be located in new markets, either within or outside the united states, where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;

   we may acquire real estate through the acquisition of the ownership entity subjecting us to the risks of that entity; and

   we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

we have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties through the acquisition of first mortgage or mezzanine debt. investments in these loans must be carefully structured to ensure that we satisfy the various asset and income requirements applicable to reits. if we fail to structure any such acquisition properly, we could fail to qualify as a reit. in addition, acquisitions of first mortgage or mezzanine loans subject us to the risks associated with the borrowers default, including potential bankruptcy, and there may be significant delays and costs associated with the process of foreclosure on collateral securing or supporting these investments. there can be no assurance that we would recover any or all of our investment in the event of such a default or bankruptcy.
we have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in bplp. this acquisition structure has the effect, among others, of reducing the amount of tax depreciation we can deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and typically requires that we agree to protect the contributors ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and/or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. these restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions.
any future international activities will be subject to special risks and we may not be able to effectively manage our international business.
we have underwritten, and in the future may acquire, properties, portfolios of properties or interests in real-estate related entities on a strategic or selective basis in international markets that are new to us. if we acquire properties or platforms located in these markets, we will face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge and understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with
22
local laws and government and permitting procedures. in addition, our international operations will be subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revisions in tax treaties or other laws and regulations, including those governing the taxation of our international income, restrictions on the transfer of funds and uncertainty over terrorist activities. we cannot predict the likelihood that any of these developments may occur. further, we may in the future enter into agreements with non-u.s. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in the courts of, another country or region. we cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise.
investments in international markets may also subject us to risks associated with funding increasing headcount, integrating new offices, and establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with u.s. laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign laws and regulations.
we may be subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we invest.
if we invest in countries where the u.s. dollar is not the national currency, we will be subject to international currency risks from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the currencies of those other countries. a significant depreciation in the value of the currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may materially affect our results of operations. we may attempt to mitigate any such effects by borrowing in the currency of the country in which we are investing and, under certain circumstances, by hedging exchange rate fluctuations; however, access to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all, in certain locations. for leases denominated in international currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage the international currency exchange risk. we cannot assure you, however, that our efforts will successfully neutralize all international currency risks.
acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability.
we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities. as a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include:
   liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination;

   claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties;

   liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and

   claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.

competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties.
we plan to continue to acquire properties as we are presented with attractive opportunities. we may face competition for acquisition opportunities with other investors, and this competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks:
   we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors, including publicly traded and private reits, institutional investment funds and other real estate investors; and

   even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price.

23
our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments.
in appropriate circumstances, we intend to develop, acquire and recapitalize properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. we currently have joint ventures that are and are not consolidated within our financial statements. our share of the aggregate revenue from all of our joint ventures represented approximately 19.5% of our total revenue (the sum of our total consolidated revenue and our share of such joint venture revenue) for the three months ended december 31, 2014. our participation in joint ventures is subject to the risks that:
   we could become engaged in a dispute with any of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to develop, finance or operate a property and could lead to the sale of either parties ownership interest or the property;

   some of our joint ventures are subject to debt and in the current credit markets the refinancing of such debt may require equity capital calls;

   our joint venture partners may default on their obligations necessitating that we fulfill their obligation ourselves;

   our joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of properties;

   our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes and this could create conflicts of interest;

   our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest; and

   our joint ventures may be unable to repay any amounts that we may loan to them.

our properties face significant competition.
we face significant competition from developers, owners and operators of office and residential properties and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from our tenants. substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market. this competition may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents we are able to charge. these competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties, which may result in their owners being willing to lease available space at lower rates than the space in our properties.
we face potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or re-leasing space.
we derive most of our income from rent received from our tenants. if a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely rental payments. also, when our tenants decide not to renew their leases or terminate early, we may not be able to re-let the space. even if tenants decide to renew or lease new space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. as a result, our cash flow could decrease and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders could be adversely affected.
we face potential adverse effects from major tenants bankruptcies or insolvencies.
the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our properties. our tenants could file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent in the future. we cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. on the other hand, a bankrupt tenant may reject and terminate its lease with us. in such case, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid and future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and, even so, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full. this shortfall could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.
24
we may have difficulty selling our properties, which may limit our flexibility.
properties like the ones that we own could be difficult to sell. this may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. in addition, federal tax laws limit our ability to sell properties and this may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting returns to our securityholders. these restrictions reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our ability to dispose of some of our properties is constrained by their tax attributes. properties which we developed and have owned for a significant period of time or which we acquired through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in bplp often have low tax bases. furthermore, as a reit, we may be subject to a 100% prohibited transactions tax on the gain from dispositions of property if we are deemed to hold the property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, unless the disposition qualifies under a safe harbor exception for properties that have been held for at least two years and with respect to which certain other requirements are met. the potential application of the prohibited transactions tax could cause us to forego potential dispositions of property or other opportunities that might otherwise be attractive to us, or to undertake such dispositions or other opportunities through a taxable reit subsidiary, which would generally result in income taxes being incurred. if we dispose of these properties outright in taxable transactions, we may be required to distribute a significant amount of the taxable gain to our securityholders under the requirements of the internal revenue code for reits, which in turn would impact our future cash flow and may increase our leverage. in some cases, without incurring additional costs we may be restricted from disposing of properties contributed in exchange for our partnership interests under tax protection agreements with contributors. to dispose of low basis or tax-protected properties efficiently we from time to time use like-kind exchanges, which qualify for non-recognition of taxable gain, but can be difficult to consummate and result in the property for which the disposed assets are exchanged inheriting their low tax bases and other tax attributes (including tax protection covenants).
because we own a hotel property, we face the risks associated with the hospitality industry.
the following factors, among others, are common to the hotel industry, and may reduce the receipts generated by our hotel property:
   our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, a number of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than our hotel-operating business partners;

   if there is an increase in operating costs resulting from inflation and other factors, our hotel-operating business partners may not be able to offset such increase by increasing room rates;

   our hotel property is subject to the fluctuating and seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism; and

   our hotel property is subject to general and local economic and social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, including war and terrorism.

in addition, because our hotel property is located in cambridge, massachusetts, it is subject to the cambridge markets fluctuations in demand, increases in operating costs and increased competition from additions in supply.
we face risks associated with short-term liquid investments.
we continue to have significant cash balances that we invest in a variety of short-term investments that are intended to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income. from time to time, these investments may include (either directly or indirectly):
   direct obligations issued by the u.s. treasury;

25
   obligations issued or guaranteed by the u.s. government or its agencies;

   taxable municipal securities;

   obligations (including certificates of deposit) of banks and thrifts;

   commercial paper and other instruments consisting of short-term u.s. dollar denominated obligations issued by corporations and banks;

   repurchase agreements collateralized by corporate and asset-backed obligations;

   both registered and unregistered money market funds; and

   other highly rated short-term securities.

investments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss of principal. under certain circumstances we may be required to redeem all or part of our investment, and our right to redeem some or all of our investment may be delayed or suspended. in addition, there is no guarantee that our investments in these securities or funds will be redeemable at par value. a decline in the value of our investment or a delay or suspension of our right to redeem may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends.
if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, we will be taxed as a corporation unless certain relief provisions apply. we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit. however, we cannot assure you that we are qualified as such, or that we will remain qualified as such in the future. this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code as to which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of facts and circumstances not entirely within our control. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.
in addition, we currently hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as reits and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as reits. if any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, then we may also fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes.
if we fail to qualify as a reit then, unless certain relief provisions apply, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for payment of dividends for each of the years involved because:
   we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;

   we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and

   unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified.

in addition, if we fail to qualify as a reit and the relief provisions do not apply, we will no longer be required to pay dividends. as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit could impair our ability
26
to raise capital and expand our business, and it would adversely affect the value of our common stock. if we fail to qualify as a reit but are eligible for certain relief provisions, then we may retain our status as a reit but may be required to pay a penalty tax, which could be substantial.
in order to maintain our reit status, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions.
in order to maintain our reit status, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the reit distribution requirements, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. to qualify as a reit, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income each year, excluding capital gains and with certain other adjustments. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which dividends paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. we may need short-term debt or long-term debt or proceeds from asset sales, creation of joint ventures or sales of common stock to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. the inability of our cash flows to cover our distribution requirements could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise short- and long-term debt or sell equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain our reit status.
limits on changes in control may discourage takeover attempts beneficial to stockholders.
provisions in our charter and bylaws, our shareholder rights agreement and the limited partnership agreement of bplp, as well as provisions of the internal revenue code and delaware corporate law, may:
   delay or prevent a change of control over us or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to our stockholders; and

   limit our stockholders opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then-prevailing market prices.

stock ownership limit to facilitate maintenance of our qualification as a reit and to otherwise address concerns relating to concentration of stock ownership, our charter generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 6.6% of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of our common stock. we refer to this limitation as the ownership limit. our board of directors may waive, in its sole discretion, or modify the ownership limit with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes. in addition, under our charter each of mortimer b. zuckerman and the respective families and affiliates of mortimer b. zuckerman and edward h. linde, as well as, in general, pension plans and mutual funds, may actually and beneficially own up to 15% of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of our equity common stock. shares owned in violation of the ownership limit will be subject to the loss of rights to distributions and voting and other penalties. the ownership limit may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control.
bplps partnership agreement we have agreed in the limited partnership agreement of bplp not to engage in specified extraordinary transactions, including, among others, business combinations, unless limited partners of bplp other than us receive, or have the opportunity to receive, either (1) the same consideration for their partnership interests as holders of our common stock in the transaction or (2) limited partnership units that, among other things, would entitle the holders, upon redemption of these units, to receive shares of common equity of a publicly traded
27
company or the same consideration as holders of our common stock received in the transaction. if these limited partners would not receive such consideration, we cannot engage in the transaction unless limited partners holding at least 75% of the common units of limited partnership interest, other than those held by boston properties, inc. or its affiliates, consent to the transaction. in addition, we have agreed in the limited partnership agreement of bplp that we will not complete specified extraordinary transactions, including among others, business combinations, in which we receive the approval of our common stockholders unless (1) limited partners holding at least 75% of the common units of limited partnership interest, other than those held by boston properties, inc. or its affiliates, consent to the transaction or (2) the limited partners of bplp are also allowed to vote and the transaction would have been approved had these limited partners been able to vote as common stockholders on the transaction. therefore, if our common stockholders approve a specified extraordinary transaction, the partnership agreement requires the following before we can complete the transaction:
   holders of partnership interests in bplp, including boston properties, inc., must vote on the matter;

   boston properties, inc. must vote its partnership interests in the same proportion as our stockholders voted on the transaction; and

   the result of the vote of holders of partnership interests in bplp must be such that had such vote been a vote of stockholders, the business combination would have been approved.

as a result of these provisions, a potential acquirer may be deterred from making an acquisition proposal, and we may be prohibited by contract from engaging in a proposed extraordinary transaction, including a proposed business combination, even though our stockholders approve of the transaction.
shareholder rights plan we have a shareholder rights plan. under the terms of this plan, we can in effect prevent a person or group from acquiring more than 15% of the outstanding shares of our common stock because, unless we approve of the acquisition, after the person acquires more than 15% of our outstanding common stock, all other stockholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less than their then fair market value. this would substantially reduce the value and influence of the stock owned by the acquiring person. our board of directors can prevent the plan from operating by approving the transaction in advance, which gives us significant power to approve or disapprove of the efforts of a person or group to acquire a large interest in our company.
changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
as with other publicly traded equity securities, the value of our common stock depends on various market conditions that may change from time to time. among the market conditions that may affect the value of our common stock are the following:
   the extent of investor interest in our securities;

   the general reputation of reits and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based companies;

   our underlying asset value;

   investor confidence in the stock and bond markets, generally;

   national economic conditions;

   changes in tax laws;

   our financial performance;

   changes in our credit ratings; and

   general stock and bond market conditions.

28
the market value of our common stock is based primarily upon the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. consequently, our common stock may trade at prices that are greater or less than our net asset value per share of common stock. if our future earnings or cash dividends are less than expected, it is likely that the market price of our common stock will diminish.
further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current securityholders.
the interests of our existing securityholders could be diluted if additional equity securities are issued to finance future developments, acquisitions, or repay indebtedness. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity.
the number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our stock.
in connection with and subsequent to our initial public offering, we have completed many private placement transactions in which shares of stock of boston properties, inc. or partnership interests in bplp were issued to owners of properties we acquired or to institutional investors. this common stock, or common stock issuable in exchange for such partnership interests in bplp, may be sold in the public securities markets over time under registration rights we granted to these investors. additional common stock issuable under our employee benefit and other incentive plans, including as a result of the grant of stock options and restricted equity securities, may also be sold in the market at some time in the future. future sales of our common stock in the market could adversely affect the price of our common stock. we cannot predict the effect the perception in the market that such sales may occur will have on the market price of our common stock.
we may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.
our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our board of directors. accordingly, our securityholders do not control these policies.
our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.
we depend on the efforts of key personnel, particularly owen d. thomas, our chief executive officer, douglas t. linde, our president, and raymond a. ritchey, executive vice president, national director of acquisitions and development. among the reasons that messrs. thomas, linde and ritchey are important to our success is that each has a national reputation, which attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders, joint venture partners and other investors. if we lost their services, our relationships with lenders, potential tenants and industry personnel could diminish.
our chief financial officer and regional managers also have strong reputations. their reputations aid us in identifying opportunities, having opportunities brought to us, and negotiating with tenants and build-to-suit prospects. while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could materially and adversely affect our operations because of diminished relationships with lenders, prospective tenants and industry personnel.
conflicts of interest exist with holders of interests in bplp.
sales of properties and repayment of related indebtedness will have different effects on holders of interests in bplp than on our stockholders.
some holders of interests in bplp, including mortimer b. zuckerman, could incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties and on the repayment of related debt which differ from
29
the tax consequences to us and our stockholders. consequently, such holders of partnership interests in bplp may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale or repayment of debt. while we have exclusive authority under the limited partnership agreement of bplp to determine when to refinance or repay debt or whether, when, and on what terms to sell a property, subject, in the case of certain properties, to the contractual commitments described below, any such decision would require the approval of our board of directors. while the board of directors has a policy with respect to these matters, mr. zuckerman, as chairman, and mr. d. linde, as a director and executive officer, could exercise their influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of some, or a majority, of our stockholders, including in a manner which could prevent completion of a sale of a property or the repayment of indebtedness.
agreement not to sell some properties.
we have entered into agreements with respect to some properties that we have acquired in exchange for partnership interests in bplp. pursuant to those agreements, we have agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer some of our properties, prior to specified dates, in any transaction that would trigger taxable income and we are responsible for the reimbursement of certain tax-related costs to the prior owners if the subject properties are sold in a taxable sale. in general, our obligations to the prior owners are limited in time and only apply to actual damages suffered. as of december 31, 2014, there were a total of three properties subject to these restrictions. in the aggregate, these properties accounted for approximately 13% of our total revenue (the sum of our total consolidated revenue and our share of joint venture revenue) for the year ended december 31, 2014.
bplp has also entered into agreements providing prior owners of properties with the right to guarantee specific amounts of indebtedness and, in the event that the specific indebtedness they guarantee is repaid or reduced, additional and/or substitute indebtedness. these agreements may hinder actions that we may otherwise desire to take to repay or refinance guaranteed indebtedness because we would be required to make payments to the beneficiaries of such agreements if we violate these agreements.
compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.
the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings, including office buildings and hotels, be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. if, under the americans with disabilities act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to our securityholders.
our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.
failure to comply with federal government contractor requirements could result in substantial costs and loss of substantial revenue.
we are subject to compliance with a wide variety of complex legal requirements because we are a federal government contractor. these laws regulate how we conduct business, require us to administer various compliance programs and require us to impose compliance responsibilities on some of our contractors. our failure to comply with these laws could subject us to fines, penalties and damages, cause us to be in default of our leases and other contracts with the federal government and bar us from entering into future leases and other
30
contracts with the federal government. there can be no assurance that these costs and loss of revenue will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business.
some potential losses are not covered by insurance.
we carry insurance coverage on our properties of types and in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties. in response to the uncertainty in the insurance market following the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001, the federal terrorism risk insurance act (as amended, tria) was enacted in november 2002 to require regulated insurers to make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism (as defined by the statute). the expiration date of tria was extended to december 31, 2014 by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2007 and further extended to december 31, 2020 by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 (tripra), and we can provide no assurance that it will be extended further. currently, the per occurrence limits of our portfolio property insurance program are $1.0 billion, including coverage for acts of terrorism other than nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological terrorism (terrorism coverage). we also carry $250 million of terrorism coverage for 601 lexington avenue, new york, new york (601 lexington avenue) in excess of the $1.0 billion of terrorism coverage in our property insurance program. certain properties, including the general motors building located at 767 fifth avenue in new york, new york (767 fifth avenue), are currently insured in separate insurance programs. the property insurance program per occurrence limits for 767 fifth avenue are $1.625 billion, including terrorism coverage. through june 9, 2014, $1.375 billion of the terrorism coverage for 767 fifth avenue in excess of $250 million was provided by nyxp, llc (nyxp), as a direct insurer. after june 9, 2014, all of the terrorism coverage for 767 fifth avenue has been provided by third party insurers. we also currently carry nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorism insurance coverage for acts of terrorism certified under tria (nbcr coverage), which is provided by ixp, as a direct insurer, for the properties in our portfolio, including 767 fifth avenue, but excluding certain other properties owned in joint ventures with third parties or which we manage. the per occurrence limit for nbcr coverage is $1 billion. under tria, after the payment of the required deductible and coinsurance, the nbcr coverage provided by ixp and the terrorism coverage provided by nyxp are backstopped by the federal government if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a program trigger. in 2015, the program trigger is $100.0 million and the coinsurance is 15%, however both will increase in subsequent years pursuant to tripra. if the federal government pays out for a loss under tria, it is mandatory that the federal government recoup the full amount of the loss from insurers offering tria coverage after the payment of the loss pursuant to a formula in tripra. we may elect to terminate the nbcr coverage if the federal government seeks recoupment for losses paid under tria, if there is a change in our portfolio or for any other reason. we intend to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance and maintain terrorism insurance in amounts and on terms that are commercially reasonable.
we also currently carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes in an amount and subject to self-insurance that we believe is commercially reasonable. in addition, this insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. specifically, we currently carry earthquake insurance which covers our san francisco region (excluding salesforce tower and through october 22, 2014 excluding 535 mission street) with a $170 million per occurrence limit (increased on march 1, 2015 from $120 million) and a $170 million annual aggregate limit (increased on march 1, 2015 from $120 million), $20 million of which is provided by ixp, as a direct insurer. the builders risk policy maintained for the development of 535 mission street in san francisco included a $15 million per occurrence and annual aggregate limit of earthquake coverage through october 22, 2014, after which time 535 mission street was included in our portfolio earthquake insurance program. in addition, the builders risk policy maintained for the development of salesforce tower in san francisco includes a $60 million per occurrence and annual aggregate limit of earthquake coverage (increased from $15 million on july 29, 2014). the amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. in addition, the amount of earthquake coverage could impact our ability to finance properties subject to earthquake risk. we may discontinue earthquake insurance or change the structure of our earthquake insurance program on some or all of our properties in the future if the premiums exceed our estimation of the value of the coverage.
31
ixp, a captive insurance company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage for our greater san francisco properties and our nbcr coverage. nyxp, a captive insurance company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary, acted as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of our terrorism coverage for 767 fifth avenue through june 9, 2014. nyxp only insured losses which exceeded the program trigger under tria and nyxp reinsured with a third-party insurance company any coinsurance payable under tria. insofar as we own ixp and nyxp, we are responsible for their liquidity and capital resources, and the accounts of ixp and nyxp are part of our consolidated financial statements. in particular, if a loss occurs which is covered by our nbcr coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under tria, ixp would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the federal government. ixp and nyxp would also be responsible for any recoupment charges by the federal government in the event losses are paid out and their insurance policies are maintained after the payout by the federal government. if we experience a loss and ixp or nyxp are required to pay under their insurance policies, we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of the required payment. therefore, insurance coverage provided by ixp and nyxp should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance. in addition, our operating partnership has issued a guarantee to cover liabilities of ixp in the amount of $20.0 million.
the mortgages on our properties typically contain requirements concerning the financial ratings of the insurers who provide policies covering the property. we provide the lenders on a regular basis with the identity of the insurance companies in our insurance programs. the ratings of some of our insurers are below the rating requirements in some of our loan agreements and the lenders for these loans could attempt to claim an event of default has occurred under the loan. we believe we could obtain insurance with insurers which satisfy the rating requirements. additionally, in the future our ability to obtain debt financing secured by individual properties, or the terms of such financing, may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist on ratings for insurers or amounts of insurance which are difficult to obtain or which result in a commercially unreasonable premium. there can be no assurance that a deficiency in the financial ratings of one or more of our insurers will not have a material adverse effect on us.
we continue to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism and california earthquake risk in particular, but we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. there are other types of losses, such as from wars, for which we cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost. with respect to such losses and losses from acts of terrorism, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties. depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property, it is possible that we could be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations.
actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties.
we have significant investments in large metropolitan markets that have been or may be in the future the targets of actual or threatened terrorism attacks, including boston, new york, san francisco and washington, dc. as a result, some tenants in these markets may choose to relocate their businesses to other markets or to lower-profile office buildings within these markets that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity. this could result in an overall decrease in the demand for office space in these markets generally or in our properties in particular, which could increase vacancies in our properties or necessitate that we lease our properties on less favorable terms or both. in addition, future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our properties, both physically and financially, or cause losses that materially exceed our insurance coverage. as a result of the foregoing, our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties could decline materially. see also some potential losses are not covered by insurance.
32
we face risks associated with our tenants and contractual counterparties being designated prohibited persons by the office of foreign assets control.
pursuant to executive order 13224 and other laws, the office of foreign assets control of the united states department of the treasury (ofac) maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned (prohibited persons). ofac regulations and other laws prohibit conducting business or engaging in transactions with prohibited persons (the ofac requirements). certain of our loan and other agreements require us to comply with ofac requirements. we have established a compliance program whereby tenants and others with whom we conduct business are checked against the ofac list of prohibited persons prior to entering into any agreement and on a periodic basis thereafter. our leases and other agreements, in general, require the other party to comply with ofac requirements. if a tenant or other party with whom we contract is placed on the ofac list we may be required by the ofac requirements to terminate the lease or other agreement. any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or a damage claim by the other party that the termination was wrongful.
we face possible risks associated with the physical effects of climate change.
we cannot assert with certainty whether climate change is occurring and, if so, at what rate. however, the physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations and business. for example, many of our properties are located along the east and west coasts, particularly those in the central business districts of boston, new york, and san francisco. to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, our markets could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea-levels. over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for office space in our buildings or our inability to operate the buildings at all. climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy and increasing the cost of snow removal at our properties. there can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business.
potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs.
under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at our properties simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real estate. if unidentified environmental problems arise, we may have to make substantial payments, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders, because: as owner or operator we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination; the law typically imposes clean-up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination; even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination, each person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs; and governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs.
these costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the amount of our insurance or the value of the contaminated property. we currently carry environmental insurance in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. specifically, we carry a pollution legal liability policy with a $20 million limit per incident and a policy aggregate limit of $40 million. the presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. in addition, applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with contamination. changes in laws, regulations and practices and their implementation increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing at our properties, or increasing the restrictions on the handling, storage or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or other actions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures.
33
environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos and other building materials. for example, laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos:
   properly manage and maintain the asbestos;

   notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos; and

   undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building.

such laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.
some of our properties are located in urban and previously developed areas where fill or current or historic industrial uses of the areas have caused site contamination. it is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update phase i environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys with respect to our acquisition of properties. these assessments generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas, an examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant state, federal and historical documents, but do not involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling. where appropriate, on a property-by-property basis, our practice is to have these consultants conduct additional testing, including sampling for asbestos, for lead and other contaminants in drinking water and, for soil and/or groundwater contamination where underground storage tanks are or were located or where other past site usage creates a potential environmental problem. even though these environmental assessments are conducted, there is still the risk that:
   the environmental assessments and updates did not identify all potential environmental liabilities;

   a prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the assessments;

   new environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted; and

   future uses or conditions such as changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability for us.

inquiries about indoor air quality may necessitate special investigation and, depending on the results, remediation beyond our regular indoor air quality testing and maintenance programs. indoor air quality issues can stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources, and biological contaminants such as molds, pollen, viruses and bacteria. indoor exposure to chemical or biological contaminants above certain levels can be alleged to be connected to allergic reactions or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. if these conditions were to occur at one of our properties, we may be subject to third-party claims for personal injury, or may need to undertake a targeted remediation program, including without limitation, steps to increase indoor ventilation rates and eliminate sources of contaminants. such remediation programs could be costly, necessitate the temporary relocation of some or all of the propertys tenants or require rehabilitation of the affected property.
we face risks associated with security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (it) networks and related systems.
we face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems. the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number,
34
intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems) and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.
a security breach or other significant disruption involving our it networks and related systems could:
   disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants;

   result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants, missed reporting deadlines and/or missed permitting deadlines;

   result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a reit;

                                    result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;

   result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space;

   require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result;

   subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; or

   damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally.

any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we did not obtain new owners title insurance policies in connection with properties acquired during our initial public offering.
we acquired many of our properties from our predecessors at the completion of our initial public offering in june 1997. before we acquired these properties, each of them was insured by a title insurance policy. we did not obtain new owners title insurance policies in connection with the acquisition of these properties. to the extent we have financed properties after acquiring them in connection with the initial public offering, we have obtained new title insurance policies, however, the amount of these policies may be less than the current or future value of the applicable properties. nevertheless, because in many instances we acquired these properties indirectly by acquiring ownership of the entity that owned the property and those owners remain in existence as our subsidiaries, some of these title insurance policies may continue to benefit us. many of these title insurance policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties. if there was a title defect related to any of these properties, or to any of the properties acquired at the time of our initial public offering, that is no longer covered by a title insurance policy, we could lose both our capital invested in and our
35
anticipated profits from such property. we have obtained title insurance policies for all properties that we have acquired after our initial public offering, however, these policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties.
we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could negatively impact our financial condition.
at any time, the u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended, including with respect to our hotel ownership structure. we cannot predict if or when any new u.s. federal income tax law, regulation, or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing u.s. federal income tax law, treasury regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. we, our taxable reit subsidiaries, and our shareholders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, u.s. federal income tax law, treasury regulation or administrative interpretation.
we face possible adverse state local tax audits and changes in state and local tax law.
because we are organized and qualify as a reit, we are generally not subject to federal income taxes, but we are subject to certain state and local taxes. in the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits. although we believe that we have substantial arguments in favor of our positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. collectively, tax deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material. however, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. if such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends.
changes in accounting pronouncements could adversely affect our operating results, in addition to the reported financial performance of our tenants.
accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for u.s. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. proposed changes include, but are not limited to, changes in lease accounting and the adoption of accounting standards likely to require the increased use of fair-value measures.
these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements. similarly, these changes could have a material impact on our tenants reported financial condition or results of operations or could affect our tenants preferences regarding leasing real estate.
item 7managements   discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.
forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k, including the documents incorporated by reference, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. we intend these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are including this statement for purposes of complying with those safe harbor provisions. such statements are contained principally, but not only, under the captions businessbusiness and growth strategies, risk factors and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. we caution investors that any such forward-looking statements are based on beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. when used, the words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, project, result, should, will and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected by the forward-looking statements. we caution you that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends.
some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:
   the continuing impacts of the relatively weak economic recovery, relatively high unemployment and other macroeconomic trends, which are having and may continue to have a negative effect on the following, among other things:

   the fundamentals of our business, including overall market occupancy, tenant space utilization, and rental rates;

           the financial condition of our tenants, many of which are financial, legal and other professional firms, our lenders, counterparties to our derivative financial instruments and institutions that hold our cash balances and short-term investments, which may expose us to increased risks of default by these parties; and

   the value of our real estate assets, which may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or obtain or maintain debt financing secured by our properties or on an unsecured basis;

   general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, tenant space utilization, dependence on tenants financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate);

   failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets and sub-markets or to integrate acquisitions and developments successfully;

   the ability of our joint venture partners to satisfy their obligations;

48
                              risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits, tenant accounting considerations that may result in negotiated lease provisions that limit a tenants liability during construction and public opposition to such activities);

   risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including the impact of higher interest rates on the cost and/or availability of financing;

   risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements;

   risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets;

   risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks;

   costs of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and other similar laws;

   potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination;

   risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended;

   possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws;

   the impact of newly adopted accounting principles on our accounting policies and on period-to-period comparisons of financial results;

   risks associated with possible state and local tax audits; and

   risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.

the risks set forth above are not exhaustive. other sections of this report, including part i, item 1arisk factors, include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on form 10-q for future periods and current reports on form 8-k as we file them with the sec, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through current reports on form 8-k or otherwise, for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. we expressly disclaim any responsibility to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events, or otherwise, and you should not rely upon these forward-looking statements after the date of this report.
overview we are a fully integrated self-administered and self-managed reit and one of the largest owners and developers of class a office properties in the united states. our properties are concentrated in four marketsboston, new york, san francisco and washington, dc. we generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing class a office space to our tenants. factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid at inception and throughout the lease term, the costs of tenant improvements and other landlord concessions, current and anticipated operating costs and real estate taxes, our current and anticipated vacancy, current and anticipated future demand for office space and general economic factors. from time to time, we also generate cash through the sale of assets.
our core strategy has always been to own, operate and develop properties in supply-constrained markets with high barriers-to-entry and to focus on executing long-term leases with financially strong tenants.
49
historically, this combination has tended to reduce our exposure in down cycles and enhance revenues as market conditions improve. to be successful in the current leasing environment, we believe all aspects of the tenant-landlord relationship must be considered. in this regard, we believe that our understanding of tenants short- and long-term space utilization and amenity needs in the local markets in which we operate, our relationships with local brokers, our reputation as a premier developer, owner and operator of class a office properties, our financial strength and our ability to maintain high building standards provide us with a competitive advantage.
our portfolio is concentrated in markets and submarkets which include traditional tenants, such as government, financial services and law firms, as well as businesses that are oriented on new ideas, such as technology, advertising, media and information distribution (often referred to as tami), mobility, life sciences and medical devices. we continue to benefit from this as these segments of the economy are expanding and leasing additional office space. this is particularly true in the san francisco central business district (cbd), silicon valley, cambridge, massachusetts and suburban boston submarkets where we are seeing increasing levels of leasing activity. however, there continue to be headwinds against more rapid improvements in the overall office business. the strongest force is densification, which occurs as businesses seek to cater to more collaborative work environments and fit people more efficiently into less space. while demand from traditional office tenants in the legal and large financial services sectors is not expanding, we see signs that we may be nearing the end of those industries space reductions stemming from densification and downsizing, and small financial firms are expanding and absorbing high-quality space. in addition, markets such as washington, dc and, to a lesser extent, midtown manhattan, which are more reliant on traditional tenants, are experiencing relatively lower levels of activity and growth. we are also seeing new construction in our markets accommodating both growing tenant sectors and traditional tenants seeking more efficient space utilization. this may result in an increase in supply and create challenges for us to increase our occupancy and the rents we can realize. we continue to proactively manage our near- and medium-term lease expirations. as our tenants adjust their space needs, we have extended and expect to continue to extend the leases of quality tenants on a long-term basis, invest in tenant improvements to improve space utilization and take back portions of their space to re-lease to other tenants at current rates. in some cases, this may result in an increase in vacancy and foregone revenue in the short-term, but better position us for more stable long-term revenues. despite these challenges, we remain optimistic about the long-term operating fundamentals in all of our markets.
leasing activity in our portfolio remains strong. during 2014, we signed the highest annual volume of leases in our history encompassing approximately 7.7 million square feet of leases covering vacant space, pre-leasing for our development projects and extensions and expansions. leasing highlights included an approximately 714,000 square foot lease with salesforce.com at our approximately 1.4 million square foot development project located in san francisco, california and approximately 1.4 million square feet of early renewals with six law firms. the overall percentage of leased space for the 155 properties in-service (excluding the three in-service residential properties and the hotel) as of december 31, 2014 was 91.7% compared to 93.4% at december 31, 2013. the decrease of 1.7% is primarily due to (1) temporary vacancy at 101 huntington avenue in boston, massachusetts, which was 32.6% leased at december 31, 2014 but approximately 93.6% committed including an approximately 308,000 square foot tenant that is expected to take occupancy in the second quarter of 2015, and (2) the placing in-service of 250 west 55th street, our approximately 988,000 square foot office building in new york city, which was approximately 55.1% leased at december 31, 2014 but is currently 79% leased, including leases with future commencement dates.
in the new york region, during the year, we completed approximately 1.8 million square feet of leasing in 84 lease transactions, including approximately 1.1 million square feet of early renewals with four law firms at 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building), 601 lexington avenue and 599 lexington avenue for lease terms ranging from 12 to 20 years. in addition, we fully placed in-service our 250 west 55th street development project and ceased interest capitalization on september 1, 2014. we have limited rollover exposure through the end of 2015 of approximately 3.0%. we continue to actively manage our near-term lease expirations and, if we have attractive replacement tenants, we may allow an existing tenant to terminate its lease early so that we may elongate our leasing profile. however, this could result in temporary vacancy and a reduction in cash flows as space is reconfigured.
50
in our washington, dc region, the overall leasing activity continues to be slow and public sector and defense contractor demand has been adversely impacted by continued federal budgetary uncertainty, sequestration and the reductions in discretionary spending programs. although the leasing market is competitive, we are making good progress with activity on our future exposure. our near-term exposure in the washington, dc cbd is limited due to our strong office occupancy rate of 95.9%. we are actively engaging our law firm tenants with future lease expirations. we have renewed one law firm tenant for approximately 250,000 square feet and are in discussions with a second for approximately 212,000 square feet, to provide new space configurations in exchange for extended lease terms at market rents. in addition, our suburban washington, dc assets are 94.1% leased at december 31, 2014, with moderate rollover/exposure through the end of 2015 of approximately 9.2%.
in the boston region, the expansion of the life sciences and technology industry is positively impacting each of the submarkets in which we operate. our assets in the boston cbd are 91.3% leased, with approximately 308,000 square feet at 101 huntington avenue leased to a tenant that is expected to take occupancy in the second quarter of 2015. through the end of 2015, leases for approximately 605,000 square feet are scheduled to expire, including two large blocks totaling approximately 445,000 square feet in the john hancock tower. this space includes (1) approximately 168,000 square feet at the base of the building where we anticipate creating a new second lobby and rebranding this portion of the building 120 st. james street and (2) approximately 277,000 square feet in the tower. while we believe all of this space is highly marketable and current market rents are greater than the expiring rents, we expect much of this space will be vacant during 2015. in conjunction with the construction of our approximately 425,000 square foot development project at 888 boylston street, we expect to complete a major renovation of the prudential center food court and create additional retail space during 2015 which, upon completion, will enhance our revenues and our tenants experience at the prudential center. the east cambridge submarket is the strongest submarket in the region and our cambridge portfolio is approximately 99.6% leased. in the suburbs of boston along the route 128 corridor, we are also benefiting from the strong tenant demand in the technology and life sciences industries with the completion of approximately 1.1 million square feet of leases during the year, including an approximately 182,000 square foot lease for our anchor tenant at 10 citypoint, an approximately 245,000 square foot development project in waltham, massachusetts.
the san francisco cbd and silicon valley submarkets are two of the strongest in the united states and continue to benefit from business expansion and job growth, particularly in the technology sector, which has resulted in positive absorption, lower vacancy and increasing rental rates. during 2014, we leased approximately 1.7 million square feet, including an approximately 714,000 square foot lease for our salesforce tower development project. we have approximately 471,000 square feet of space expiring in the san francisco region through the end of 2015 at rents that are below current market rates. construction of 535 mission street is complete with initial occupancy occurring in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the project is approximately 66% leased as of february 23, 2015.

(1)                                     second generation leases are defined as leases for space that had previously been under lease by us. of the 880,619 and 3,936,046 square feet of second generation leases that commenced during the three and twelve months ended december 31, 2014, respectively, 566,876 and 2,793,051 square feet were signed in prior periods for the three and twelve months ended december 31, 2014, respectively.

(2)   total transaction costs include tenant improvements and leasing commissions and exclude free rent concessions.

(3)                             represents the increase/(decrease) in gross rent (base rent plus expense reimbursements) on the new vs. expired leases on the 780,911 and 3,295,755 square feet of second generation leases (1) that had been occupied within the prior 12 months and (2) for which the new lease term is greater than six months, for the three and twelve months ended december 31, 2014, respectively.

(4)                         represents the increase/(decrease) in net rent (gross rent less operating expenses) on the new vs. expired leases on the 780,911 and 3,295,755 square feet of second generation leases (1) that had been occupied within the prior 12 months and (2) for which the new lease term is greater than six months, for the three and twelve months ended december 31, 2014, respectively.

in the aggregate from december 31, 2014 to december 31, 2015, leases representing approximately 7.2% of the space at our properties will expire. as these leases expire, assuming no change in current market rental rates, we expect that the gross rental rates we are likely to achieve on new leases will on average be greater than the rates that are currently being paid.
although we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets, the abundance of capital and demand for assets has resulted in increasing prices. as a result, in the current environment we are able to develop properties at a cost per square foot that is generally less than the cost at which we can acquire older existing properties, thereby generating relatively better returns with lower annual maintenance expenses and capital costs. accordingly, we believe the successful lease-up and completion of our development pipeline will enhance our long-term return on equity and earnings growth as these developments are placed in-service through 2019. we believe the development of well-positioned office buildings is justified in many of our submarkets where tenants
52
have shown demand for high-quality construction, modern design, efficient floor plates and sustainable features. in addition, select first-class residential developments that are part of a mixed-use environment, which combine office, retail and residential uses, have proven successful in our markets. as of december 31, 2014, our current development pipeline, which excludes properties which are fully placed in-service, totals approximately 3.3 million square feet with a total projected investment of approximately $2.1 billion, of which approximately $1.3 billion remains to be funded. additionally, we are working on several new developments in each of our markets that could commence in 2015 or later.
given investor demand for assets like ours we continue to review our portfolio to identify properties that may have limited opportunities for cash flow growth, no longer fit within our portfolio strategy or can attract premium pricing in the current market environment as potential sales candidates. during 2014, we completed the sale of an aggregate of approximately $2.3 billion (our share) of assets generating $2.0 billion of sale proceeds. included in this amount is the october 30, 2014 sale of a 45% interest in each of 601 lexington avenue in new york city and atlantic wharf office building and 100 federal street in boston for an aggregate gross sale price of $1.827 billion in cash, less the partners pro rata share of indebtedness secured by 601 lexington avenue, subject to certain prorations and adjustments. as of january 15, 2015, we have under contract for sale the residences on the avenue, our 335 unit residential leasehold at 2221 i street, n.w., washington, dc, for a gross sale price of $196 million. the sale is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and there can be no assurance that the sale will be consummated on the terms currently contemplated or at all. we are also considering additional asset sales and, in total, we project our sales volume for 2015 could be in excess of $750 million.
in general, we structure asset sales for possible inclusion in like-kind exchanges within the meaning of section 1031 of the internal revenue code. the ability to complete a like-kind exchange depends on many factors, including, among others, identifying and acquiring suitable replacement property within limited time periods and the ownership structure of the properties being sold and acquired, and therefore we are not always able to sell an asset as part of a like-kind exchange. when successful, a like-kind exchange enables us to defer the taxable gain on the asset sold and thus limit our reit distribution requirement and preserve capital. if we are unable to identify and acquire suitable replacement property in a like-kind exchange, then we expect to distribute at least the amount of proceeds necessary to avoid paying a corporate level tax on the gain realized from the sale (see liquidity and capital resourcesreit tax distribution considerationsapplication of recent regulations).
we continue to maintain substantial liquidity, including available cash, as of february 23, 2015, of approximately $1.1 billion, which includes approximately $342.2 million of restricted cash which is being held for possible investment in a like-kind exchange in accordance with section 1031 of the internal revenue code, and approximately $983.5 million available under our operating partnerships $1.0 billion unsecured line of credit. our more significant future funding requirements include approximately $1.3 billion of our development pipeline that remains to be funded through 2019. we have access to multiple sources of capital, including current cash balances, public debt and equity markets, secured and unsecured debt markets and potential asset sales to fund our future capital requirements.
for descriptions of significant transactions that we completed during 2014, see item 1. businesstransactions during 2014.
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, or gaap, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the
53
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. from time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
real estate upon acquisitions of real estate that constitutes a business, which includes the consolidation of previously unconsolidated joint ventures, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above- and below-market leases, leasing and assumed financing origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant. we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions.
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. we also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial.
we record acquired above- and below-market leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) managements estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below- market leases. acquired above- and below-market lease values have been reflected within prepaid expenses and other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease. factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. in estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. in estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.
management reviews its long-lived assets for impairment every quarter and when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. if such criteria are present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding anticipated hold periods, future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. if our hold strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. if we determine that an impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value, less cost to sell.

guidance in accounting standards codification (asc) 360 property plant and equipment (asc 360) requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. the components of the propertys net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). we generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our board of directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that a sale of the property within one year is considered probable. following the classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets, and the asset is written down to the lower of carrying value or fair market value, less cost to sell. on april 10, 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity (asu 2014-08). asu 2014-08 clarifies that discontinued operations presentation applies only to disposals representing a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results (e.g., a disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment or other major parts of an entity). asu 2014-08 is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2014. early adoption is permitted, and we early adopted asu no. 2014-08 during the first quarter of 2014. our adoption of asu 2014-08 resulted in the operating results and gains on sales of real estate from operating properties sold during the year ended december 31, 2014 not being reflected within discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
real estate is stated at depreciated cost. a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. the cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. we expense costs that we incur to effect a business combination such as legal, due diligence and other closing related costs. costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. after the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. determination of when a development project commences and capitalization begins, and when a development project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy and capitalization must cease, involves a degree of judgment. our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by guidance in asc 835-20 capitalization of interest and asc 970 real estate-general. the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs.
the capitalized costs include pre-construction costs necessary to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. we begin the capitalization of costs during the pre-construction period which we define as activities that are necessary to the development of the property. we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. we cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed, (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction or (3) if activities necessary for the development of the property have been suspended.
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures we consolidate variable interest entities (vies) in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary. vies are entities in which the equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk to finance their endeavors without additional financial support or that the holders of the equity investment at risk do not have a controlling financial interest. the primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the variable interest
55
entitys performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and right to receive the returns from the variable interest entity that would be significant to the variable interest entity. for ventures that are not vies we consolidate entities for which we have significant decision making control over the ventures operations. our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity involves the consideration of various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in the entitys governance, the size of our investment (including loans), estimates of future cash flows, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and/or liquidate the venture, if applicable. our assessment of our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements. in addition to evaluating control rights, we consolidate entities in which the outside partner has no substantive kick-out rights to remove us as the managing member.
accounts of the consolidated entity are included in our accounts and the non-controlling interest is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of equity or in temporary equity between liabilities and equity. investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are recorded initially at cost, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on the balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. under the equity method of accounting, our net equity investment is reflected within the consolidated balance sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the consolidated statements of operations. the joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses; however, our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint ventures distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. we may account for cash distributions in excess of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture as income when we are not the general partner in a limited partnership and when we have neither the requirement nor the intent to provide financial support to the joint venture. our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment periodically and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying values has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary. the ultimate realization of the investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value below the carrying value of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary.
to the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture, our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. to the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture. in accordance with the provisions of asc 970-323 investments-equity method and joint ventures (asc 970-323), we will recognize gains on the contribution of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partners interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.
the combined summarized financial information of the unconsolidated joint ventures is disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition in general, we commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. contractual rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of our respective leases. we recognize rental revenue of acquired in-place above- and below-market leases at their fair values over the original term of the respective leases. accrued rental income as reported on the consolidated balance sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements.
56
for the year ended december 31, 2014, the impact of the net adjustments of rents from above- and below-market leases increased rental revenue by approximately $48.3 million. for the year ended december 31, 2014, the impact of the straight-line rent adjustment increased rental revenue by approximately $63.1 million. those amounts exclude the adjustment of rents from above- and below-market leases and straight-line income from unconsolidated joint ventures, which are disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines. furthermore, following the initiation of a lease, we continue to actively monitor the tenants creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value. when assessing tenant credit quality, we:
   review relevant financial information, including:

   financial ratios;

   net worth;

   revenue;

   cash flows;

   leverage; and

   liquidity;

   evaluate the depth and experience of the tenants management team; and

   assess the strength/growth of the tenants industry.

as a result of the underwriting process, tenants are then categorized into one of three categories:
(1)   acceptable-risk tenants;

(2)   the tenants credit is such that we may require collateral, in which case we:

   may require a security deposit; and/or

   may reduce upfront tenant improvement investments; or

(3)   the tenants credit is below our acceptable parameters.

we consistently monitor the credit quality of our tenant base. we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenants inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease.
tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of 1 through 4. a rating of 1 represents the highest possible rating and no allowance is recorded. a rating of 4 represents the lowest credit rating, in which case we record a full reserve against the receivable balance. among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include:
   payment history;

   credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric);

   change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize);

   tenant financial performance;

   economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and

   industry specific credit considerations.

57
if our estimates of collectability differ from the cash received, the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. the average remaining term of our in-place tenant leases, including unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 6.8 years as of december 31, 2014. the credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants.
recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period during which the expenses are incurred. tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with guidance in asc 605-45 principal agent considerations (asc 605-45). asc 605-45 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. we also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis.
our parking revenues are derived from leases, monthly parking and transient parking. we recognize parking revenue as earned.
our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for telephone service, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. hotel revenues are recognized as earned.
we receive management and development fees from third parties. property management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. we review each development agreement and record development fees as earned depending on the risk associated with each project. profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects are recognized as revenue to the extent of the third-party partners ownership interest.
gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions included in asc 360-20 real estate sales (asc 360-20). the specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in asc 360-20 related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. if the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, we defer some or all of the gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, leasing, profit sharing, deposit, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met.
depreciation and amortization we compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives. we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to its components and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives. the amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations.
fair value of financial instruments the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, escrows, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values because of the short maturities of these instruments.
we follow the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements when valuing our financial instruments for disclosure purposes. we determine the fair value of our unsecured senior notes and unsecured exchangeable
58
senior notes using market prices. the inputs used in determining the fair value of our unsecured senior notes and unsecured exchangeable senior notes is categorized at a level 1 basis (as defined in the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures) due to the fact that we use quoted market rates to value these instruments. however, the inputs used in determining the fair value could be categorized at a level 2 basis if trading volumes are low. we determine the fair value of our mortgage notes payable using discounted cash flow analyses by discounting the spread between the future contractual interest payments and hypothetical future interest payments on mortgage debt based on current market rates for similar securities. in determining the current market rates, we add our estimates of market spreads to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our debt. the inputs used in determining the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and mezzanine notes payable are categorized at a level 3 basis (as defined in the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures) due to the fact that we consider the rates used in the valuation techniques to be unobservable inputs.
derivative instruments and hedging activities derivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments on the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges. these judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of net income or as a component of comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets. while management believes its judgments are reasonable, a change in a derivatives effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses, net income and equity. we account for the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative in other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassify the effective portion to earnings over the term that the hedged transaction affects earnings. we account for the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative directly in earnings.
recent accounting pronouncements on april 10, 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity (asu 2014-08). asu 2014-08 clarifies that discontinued operations presentation applies only to disposals representing a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results (e.g., a disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment or other major parts of an entity). asu 2014-08 is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2014. early adoption is permitted, and the company early adopted asu 2014-08 during the first quarter of 2014. our adoption of asu 2014-08 resulted in the operating results and gains on sales of real estate from operating properties sold during the year ended december 31, 2014 not being reflected within discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contract with customers (topic 606) (asu 2014-09). the objective of asu 2014-09 is to establish a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. the core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. in applying asu 2014-09, companies will perform a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. asu 2014-09 applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the fasbs accounting standards codification (asc). asu 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim periods within that reporting period) beginning after december 15, 2016 and shall be applied using either a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach. early adoption is not permitted. we are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of asu 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
59
in june 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-12, accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period (asu 2014-12). the amendments in asu 2014-12 require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. a reporting entity should apply existing guidance in asc topic no. 718, compensationstock compensation (asc 718), as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. the amendments in asu 2014-12 are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december 15, 2015. early adoption is permitted. entities may apply the amendments in asu 2014-12 either: (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. we do not expect the adoption of asu 2014-12 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in august 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-15, presentation of financial statementsgoing concern: disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern (asu 2014-15). asu 2014-15 requires an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable) and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. asu 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after december 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted. we do not expect the adoption of asu 2014-15 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in november 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-16, determining whether the host contract in a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share is more akin to debt or to equity (asu 2014-16). asu 2014-16 clarifies how current gaap should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. specifically, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider all relevant terms and featuresincluding the embedded derivative feature being evaluated for bifurcationin evaluating the nature of the host contract. furthermore, the amendments clarify that no single term or feature would necessarily determine the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. rather, the nature of the host contract depends upon the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument. asu 2014-16 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015. early adoption is permitted. we do not expect the adoption of asu 2014-16 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in february 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-02, consolidation (topic 810): amendments to the consolidation analysis (asu 2015-02). asu 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. asu 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are vies or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with vies, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. asu 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2015. early adoption is permitted. a reporting entity may apply the amendments in asu 2015-02 using: (a) a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption; or (b) by applying the amendments retrospectively. we are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of asu 2015-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
results of operations the following discussion is based on our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
at december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we owned or had interests in a portfolio of 169, 175 and 157 properties, respectively (in each case, the total property portfolio). as a result of changes within our total property portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from
60
period-to-period. accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data with respect to the total property portfolio are necessarily meaningful. therefore, the comparison of operating results for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us and in service throughout each period compared (the same property portfolio) and the changes attributable to the properties included in the placed in-service, acquired or consolidated, development or redevelopment or sold portfolios.
in our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. we refer to properties acquired or consolidated or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us and in service through the end of the latest period presented as our same property portfolio. the same property portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in-service, acquired or consolidated, repositioned or in development or redevelopment after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented.
net operating income, or noi, is a non-gaap financial measure equal to net income attributable to boston properties, inc., the most directly comparable gaap financial measure, plus income attributable to noncontrolling interests, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, impairment loss, transaction costs, general and administrative expense, less discontinued operations, gains on sales of real estate, gains (losses) from early extinguishments of debt, gains (losses) from investments in securities, gains on consolidation of joint ventures, income from unconsolidated joint ventures, interest and other income and development and management services revenue. we use noi internally as a performance measure and believe noi provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. therefore, we believe noi is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets.
our management also uses noi to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. further, we believe noi is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, noi reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspectives not immediately apparent from net income attributable to boston properties, inc. noi excludes certain components from net income attributable to boston properties, inc. in order to provide results that are more closely related to a propertys results of operations. for example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. in addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. noi presented by us may not be comparable to noi reported by other reits that define noi differently. we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, noi should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to boston properties, inc. as presented in our consolidated financial statements. noi should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to boston properties, inc. as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. for a reconciliation of noi to net income attributable to boston properties, inc., see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
comparison of the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2013
the table below shows selected operating information for the same property portfolio and the total property portfolio. the same property portfolio consists of 131 properties totaling approximately 35.8 million net rentable square feet of space, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures. the same property portfolio includes properties acquired or consolidated or placed in-service on or prior to january 1, 2013 and owned and in service through december 31, 2014. the total property portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in-service, acquired or consolidated or in development or redevelopment after january 1, 2013 or disposed of on or prior to december 31, 2014. this table includes a reconciliation from the same property portfolio to the total property portfolio by also providing information for the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 with respect to the properties which were placed in-service, acquired or consolidated, in development or redevelopment or sold.

same property portfolio rental revenue rental revenue from the same property portfolio increased approximately $58.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013. the increase was primarily the result of increases in revenue from our leases, parking income and other income and recoveries of approximately $53.6 million, $4.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively. rental revenue from our leases increased approximately $53.6 million as a result of our average revenue per square foot increasing by approximately $1.40, contributing approximately $45.7 million, and an approximately $7.9 million increase due to an increase in average occupancy from 92.3% to 92.7%.
for fiscal 2015, we project our occupancy will average approximately 91% to 92% due to several large lease expirations in our boston region. we expect our same property portfolio noi to range from a decrease of 1.0% to an increase of 0.50% when compared to 2014.
termination income termination income increased by approximately $8.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013.

(see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).
termination income for the year ended december 31, 2013 resulted from the termination of twenty-four tenants across the same property portfolio which totaled approximately $2.8 million, of which approximately $1.0 million was negotiated termination income from one of our reston, virginia properties in order to accommodate growth of an existing tenant.
real estate operating expenses operating expenses from the same property portfolio increased approximately $27.5 million, or 4.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to (1) an increase of approximately $13.4 million, or 4.5%, in real estate taxes, which we primarily experienced in our washington, dc and new york regions, (2) an increase of approximately $6.4 million, or 6.1%, in repairs and maintenance expense, which we primarily experienced in the boston and new york cbd buildings and the washington, dc region, (3) an increase of approximately $2.6 million, or 7.2%, in roads and grounds expense, which we primarily experienced in the boston and washington, dc regions, (4) an increase of approximately $2.0 million, or 1.8%, in utilities expense in the boston and san francisco regions and (5) an increase of approximately $3.1 million, or 2.6%, in other operating expenses.

on may 31, 2013, our two joint venture partners in 767 venture, llc (the entity that owns 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building) in new york city) transferred all of their interests in the joint venture to third parties. in connection with the transfer, we and our new joint venture partners modified our relative decision making authority and consent rights with respect to the joint ventures assets and operations. these changes resulted in us having sufficient financial and operating control over 767 venture, llc such that we now account for the assets, liabilities and operations of 767 venture, llc on a consolidated basis in our financial statements instead of under the equity method of accounting. our ownership interest in 767 venture, llc remained unchanged at 60%. 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building) is an approximately 1.8 million net rentable square foot, 59-story class a office tower.

(3)   average physical occupancy is defined as the average number of occupied units divided by the total number of units, expressed as a percentage.

(4)                                             average economic occupancy is defined as total possible revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible revenue. total possible revenue is determined by valuing average occupied units at contract rates and average vacant units at market rents. vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current market rents. by measuring vacant units at their market rents, average economic occupancy takes into account the fact that units of different sizes and locations within a residential property have different economic impacts on a residential propertys total possible gross revenue. market rents used by us in calculating economic occupancy are based on the current market rates set by the managers of our residential properties based on their experience in renting their residential propertys units and publicly available market data. trends in market rents for a region as reported by others could vary. market rents for a period are based on the average market rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions.

(5)   average monthly rental rates are calculated by us as rental revenue in accordance with gaap, divided by the weighted monthly average number of occupied units.

hotel net operating income net operating income for the boston marriott cambridge (formerly cambridge center marriott) hotel property increased by approximately $2.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to improvements in revenue per available room (revpar) and occupancy. we expect our hotel net operating income for fiscal 2015 to be between $12 million and $14 million.

development and management services development and management services income decreased approximately $4.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease was due to decreases in development fee and management fee income of approximately $2.2 million and $2.2 million, respectively. the decrease in development fees was primarily due to a decrease in fees associated with tenant improvement project management, as well as a decrease in the development fees earned due to the completion of several projects in the boston and washington, dc regions. the decrease in management fees is due primarily to a decrease in management and leasing fees earned from our joint ventures primarily due to the consolidation of 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building), the acquisition of the mountain view assets and the sale of 125 west 55th street, partially offset by leasing fees earned at one of our unconsolidated joint ventures in washington, dc related to a large lease that was signed. for fiscal 2015 we expect our development and management fees to be between $17 million and $22 million. our 2015 estimates are less than 2014 due to the completion of several large, third-party development fee projects in 2014, including the broad institute expansion in cambridge, massachusetts and the george washington university science center in washington, dc, and our increased focus on delivering our new development projects as opposed to third-party assignments.

general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $16.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to the timing of the recognition of expenses under the transition benefits agreement that we entered into with mortimer b. zuckerman in 2013. on march 11, 2013, we announced that owen d. thomas would succeed mr. zuckerman as our chief executive officer, effective april 2, 2013. mr. zuckerman continued to serve as executive chairman for a transition period and as of january 1, 2015 mr. zuckerman serves as the non-executive chairman of the board. because mr. zuckerman remained employed by us through july 1, 2014, he received, on january 1, 2015, a lump sum cash payment of $6.7 million and an equity award with a value of approximately $11.1 million. the cash payment and equity award vested in three equal installments on each of march 10, 2013, october 1, 2013 and july 1, 2014. as a result, we recognized approximately $13.8 million of compensation expense during the year ended december 31, 2013 and approximately $4.0 million of compensation expense during the year ended december 31, 2014 related to the transition benefits agreement. under the transition benefits agreement, during the year ended december 31, 2013, we accelerated the remaining approximately $12.9 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with mr. zuckermans unvested long-term equity awards. in addition, for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013 we had an approximately $1.7 million increase in our capitalized wages due to the signing of several large leases. the increase in capitalized wages is shown as a decrease in general and administrative expenses as these costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets or deferred charges on our consolidated balance sheets (see below). we also had an approximately $1.9 million decrease in the value of our deferred compensation plan. these decreases were partially offset by the following increases: (1) approximately $2.3 million related to the net effect of the termination of the 2011 opp awards and the issuance of the 2014 myltip units (see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements), (2) an approximately $4.4 million increase in overall compensation expense, (3) approximately $0.3 million related to the write off of the remaining fees associated with our atm program that expired on june 2, 2014 and (4) approximately $2.9 million related to other general and administrative expenses. we expect our fiscal 2015 general and administrative expenses to be between $96 million and $100 million.
wages directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. these costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. capitalized wages for the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 were approximately $14.5 million and $12.8 million, respectively. these costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above.
transaction costs transaction costs increased approximately $1.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to costs associated the formation of several new joint venture agreements and pending and completed asset sales.
impairment loss on march 28, 2013, we executed a binding contract for the sale of our 303 almaden boulevard property located in san jose, california for a sale price of $40.0 million. the pending sale of this asset caused us to evaluate our strategy for development of the adjacent almaden land parcel, which can accommodate approximately 840,000 square feet of office development. based on a shorter than expected hold period, we reduced the carrying value of the land parcel to its fair market value and recognized an impairment loss of approximately $8.3 million during the three months ended march 31, 2013.

other income and expense items income from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013, income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased by approximately $62.3 million due primarily to an approximately $46.5 million decrease in our share of net income from 125 west 55th street due to its sale on may 30, 2013, an approximately $11.2 million decrease in our share of net income from the sale of the eighth avenue and 46th street project in new york city on july 19, 2013, an approximately $7.7 million decrease in our share of net income from 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building) related to its consolidation on june 1, 2013 and an approximately $0.4 million decrease in our share of net income from the sale of mountain view research park and mountain view technology parks to us on april 10, 2013. these decreases were partially offset by an approximately $3.5 million increase in our share of net income from our other unconsolidated joint ventures, which was primarily related to increased leasing and occupancy at 540 madison avenue in new york city.
on april 10, 2013, we acquired the mountain view research park and mountain view technology park properties from the value-added fund for an aggregate net purchase price of approximately $233.1 million. prior to the acquisition, our ownership interest in the properties was approximately 39.5%. as a result of the acquisition, we owned 100% of the properties and accounted for them on a consolidated basis.
on may 30, 2013, a joint venture in which we have a 60% interest completed the sale of its 125 west 55th street property located in new york city for a sale price of $470.0 million, including the assumption by the buyer of the mortgage loan collateralized by the property totaling approximately $198.6 million. the mortgage loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.09% per annum and was scheduled to mature on march 10, 2020. net cash proceeds totaled approximately $253.7 million, of which our share was approximately $152.2 million, after the payment of transaction costs. 125 west 55th street is a class a office property totaling approximately 588,000 net rentable square feet. we had previously recognized an impairment loss on our investment in the unconsolidated joint venture. as a result, we recognized a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $43.2 million. prior to the sale, the property contributed approximately $3.3 million of net income for the year ended december 31, 2013.
on may 31, 2013, our two joint venture partners in 767 venture, llc (the entity that owns 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building) in new york city) transferred all of their interests in the joint venture to third parties. in connection with the transfer, we and our new joint venture partners modified our relative decision making authority and consent rights with respect to the joint ventures assets and operations. these changes resulted in us having sufficient financial and operating control over 767 venture, llc such that we now account for the assets, liabilities and operations of 767 venture, llc on a consolidated basis in our financial statements instead of under the equity method of accounting. our ownership interest in 767 venture, llc remained unchanged at 60%. prior to the consolidation, the property contributed approximately $7.7 million of net income for the year ended december 31, 2013.
on july 19, 2013, a joint venture in which we have a 50% interest completed the sale of its eighth avenue and 46th street project located in new york city for an imputed sale price of $45.0 million. eighth avenue and 46th street is comprised of an assemblage of land parcels and air-rights. net cash proceeds to us totaled approximately $21.8 million, after the payment of transaction costs. the joint venture had previously recognized an impairment loss on the property. as a result, the joint venture recognized a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $12.6 million, of which our share was approximately $11.3 million.

gains on consolidation of joint ventures on april 10, 2013, we acquired the mountain view research park and mountain view technology park properties from our value-added fund for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $233.5 million. prior to the acquisition, our ownership interest in the properties was approximately 39.5%. as a result of the acquisition, we own 100% of the properties and account for them on a consolidated basis. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recognized a gain on consolidation totaling approximately $26.5 million.
on may 31, 2013, our two joint venture partners in 767 venture, llc (the entity that owns 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building) in new york city) transferred all of their interests in the joint venture to third parties. in connection with the transfer, we and our new joint venture partners modified our relative decision making authority and consent rights with respect to the joint ventures assets and operations. these changes resulted in us having sufficient financial and operating control over 767 venture, llc such that we now account for the assets, liabilities and operations of 767 venture, llc on a consolidated basis in our financial statements instead of under the equity method of accounting. our ownership interest in 767 venture, llc remained unchanged at 60%. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recognized a non-cash gain on our investment of approximately $359.5 million. the gain on consolidation resulted from us recognizing the assets, liabilities and equity (including noncontrolling interests) of the joint venture at fair value on the date of consolidation resulting in the recognition of a gain on consolidation equal to the difference between the fair value of our equity interest totaling approximately $721.3 million (as reflected in the business combination table appearing in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) and the carrying value of our previously held equity interest totaling approximately $361.8 million. the fair value was determined based on the purchase price paid by the new joint venture partners through a sales process managed by a major new york city sales brokerage firm.
interest and other income interest and other income increased approximately $0.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a tax refund we received during the year ended december 31, 2014 from the district of columbia.
gains from investments in securities gains from investments in securities for the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to a deferred compensation plan that we maintain for our officers. under this deferred compensation plan, each officer who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officers current income on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer. in order to reduce our market risk relating to this plan, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer. this enables us to generally match our liabilities to our officers under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. the performance of these investments is recorded as gains from investments in securities. during the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized gains of approximately $1.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively, on these investments. by comparison, our general and administrative expense increased by approximately $1.1 million and $2.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, as a result of increases in our liability under our deferred compensation plan that were associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by our officers participating in the plan.

discontinued operations on april 10, 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity (asu 2014-08). asu 2014-08 clarifies that discontinued operations presentation applies only to disposals representing a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results (e.g., a disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment or other major parts of an entity). asu 2014-08 is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2014. early adoption is permitted, and we early adopted asu 2014-08 during the first quarter of 2014. our adoption of asu 2014-08 resulted in the operating results and gains on sales of real estate from operating properties sold during the year ended december 31, 2014 not being reflected within discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
prior to the adoption of asu 2014-08, we had the following properties that were considered discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2013: montvale center, 303 almaden boulevard, 1301 new york avenue, 10 & 20 burlington mall road and one preserve parkway. each of these dispositions is discussed below.
on february 20, 2013, the foreclosure sale of our montvale center property was ratified by the court. as a result of the ratification, the mortgage loan totaling $25.0 million was extinguished and the related obligations were satisfied with the transfer of the real estate resulting in the recognition of a gain on forgiveness of debt totaling approximately $20.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2013. the operating results of the property through the date of ratification have been classified as discontinued operations on a historical basis for all periods presented.
on june 28, 2013, we completed the sale of our 303 almaden boulevard property located in san jose, california for a sale price of $40.0 million. net cash proceeds totaled approximately $39.3 million. 303 almaden boulevard is a class a office property totaling approximately 158,000 net rentable square feet. because we entered into the related purchase and sale agreement on march 28, 2013 and the carrying value of the property exceeded its net sale price, we recognized an impairment loss totaling approximately $3.2 million during the three months ended march 31, 2013. as a result, there was no loss on sale of real estate recognized during the year ended december 31, 2013. the impairment loss and operating results of this property have been classified as discontinued operations on a historical basis for all periods presented.

on december 30, 2014, we completed the conveyance to an unrelated third party of a condominium interest in our 75 ames street property located in cambridge, massachusetts. on may 23, 2011, we had entered into a ground lease for the vacant land parcel at 75 ames street and had also entered into a development agreement to serve as project manager for a 250,000 square foot research laboratory building to be developed on the site at the ground lessees expense and to also serve, upon completion of development, as property manager. gross proceeds to us were approximately $56.8 million, including $11.4 million in development fees for our services, and were received beginning in may 2011. the cash received under the ground lease was initially recognized as unearned revenue and recognized over the 99-year term of the ground lease as ground lease revenue totaling approximately $459,000 per year prior to the conveyance of the condominium interest. the terms of the ground lease required us to form a condominium for the site upon completion of the development, at which time each party would subject their respective interests in the buildings and land to the condominium and would in turn be conveyed a condominium unit comprised of their respective building as well as an undivided ownership interest in the land. as a result of the conveyance and the transfer of title, we recognized a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $33.8 million during the year ended december 31, 2014.

during the year ended december 31, 2014 we made an out-of-period adjustment for our fountain square property of approximately $1.9 million related to the cumulative non-cash adjustment to the accretion of the changes in the redemption value of the noncontrolling interest (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).
noncontrolling interestcommon units of the operating partnership noncontrolling interestcommon units of the operating partnership decreased by approximately $19.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013 due to a decrease in allocable income partially offset by an increase in the noncontrolling interests ownership percentage.

same property portfolio rental revenue rental revenue from the same property portfolio increased approximately $54.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 2012. the increase was primarily the result of an increase of approximately $46.9 million in rental revenue from our leases and increases in parking and other recoveries of approximately $4.9 million and $3.2 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in other income of approximately $0.9 million. the increase in parking was primarily related to transient parking. the increase in rental revenue from our leases of approximately $46.9 million was the result of our average revenue increasing by approximately $0.97 per square foot, contributing approximately $29.5 million, and an approximately $17.4 million increase due to an increase in average occupancy from 91.4% to 92.3%.
termination income termination income decreased by approximately $5.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 2012.
termination income for the year ended december 31, 2013 resulted from the termination of twenty-two tenants across the same property portfolio which totaled approximately $2.4 million, of which approximately $1.0 million was negotiated termination income from one of our reston, virginia properties in order to accommodate growth of an existing tenant.
termination income for the year ended december 31, 2012 resulted from the termination of twenty-eight tenants across the same property portfolio which totaled approximately $7.6 million of which approximately $3.6 million was from the settlement of a bankruptcy claim against a former tenant that rejected our lease in 2009 and approximately $0.9 million was a negotiated termination from one of our reston, virginia properties in order to accommodate growth of an existing tenant.
real estate operating expenses operating expenses from the same property portfolio increased approximately $24.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to (1) an increase of approximately $13.9 million, or 5.3%, in real estate taxes, which increases primarily occurred in our boston and new york regions, (2) an increase of approximately $4.9 million, or 5.3%, in utilities expense, that was primarily due to an increase in the delivery rate for steam in the boston region, (3) an increase of approximately $5.3 million, or 5.8%, in property repairs and maintenance expense and (4) an increase of approximately $3.2 million, or 2.3%, in other operating expenses. this was partially offset by an approximately $3.2 million cumulative non-cash straight-line adjustment for ground rent expense that occurred in 2012 and did not recur in 2013.
we have modified the presentation of expenses to operate our san francisco and princeton regional offices to reflect the growing activity in our san francisco region and to have a consistent presentation across our company. these expenses, which totaled approximately $8.1 million and $7.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, were previously included in rental operating expenses and are now included in general and administrative expenses for all periods presented.
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense for the same property portfolio increased approximately $3.5 million, or 0.9%, for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 2012.

depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense for our properties placed in-service portfolio increased by approximately $4.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 2012.
properties in development or redevelopment portfolio at december 31, 2013 and 2012, the properties in development or redevelopment portfolio consisted primarily of our 601 massachusetts avenue property located in washington, dc.
on april 25, 2013, we commenced development of our 601 massachusetts avenue property, which is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2015. prior to the commencement of development, this building was operational and, during the year ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, had revenue of approximately $2.2 million and $7.1 million, respectively, and operating expenses of approximately $0.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively. in addition, the decrease in depreciation expense of approximately $1.6 million is the result of the property being taken out of service on april 25, 2013 and therefore not incurring a full year of depreciation expense.
other operating income and expense items residential net operating income net operating income for our residential properties increased by approximately $0.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 2012.

(1)   average physical occupancy is defined as the average number of occupied units divided by the total number of units, expressed as a percentage.

(2)                                             average economic occupancy is defined as total possible revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible revenue. total possible revenue is determined by valuing average occupied units at contract rates and average vacant units at market rents. vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current market rents. by measuring vacant units at their market rents, average economic occupancy takes into account the fact that units of different sizes and locations within a residential property have different economic impacts on a residential propertys total possible gross revenue. market rents used by us in calculating economic occupancy are based on the current market rates set by the managers of our residential properties based on their experience in renting their residential propertys units and publicly available market data. trends in market rents for a region as reported by others could vary. market rents for a period are based on the average market rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions.

(3)   average monthly rental rates are calculated by us as rental revenue in accordance with gaap, divided by the weighted monthly average number of occupied units.

hotel net operating income net operating income for the boston marriott cambridge (formerly cambridge center marriott) hotel property increased by approximately $2.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to improvements in revenue per available room (revpar) and occupancy.

development and management services development and management services income decreased approximately $4.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 2012. the decrease was due to decreases in development and management fee income of approximately $1.4 million and $3.0 million, respectively. the decrease in development fees is primarily due to a decrease in fees associated with tenant improvement project management. the net decrease in management fees is due primarily to a decrease in management fees earned from our joint ventures primarily due to the consolidation/acquisition of 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building) and the mountain view assets and the sale of 125 west 55th street in new york city, partially offset by an increase in tenant service income.

general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased approximately $25.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 2012. on march 11, 2013, we announced that owen d. thomas would succeed mortimer b. zuckerman as our chief executive officer, effective april 2, 2013. mr. zuckerman continued to serve as executive chairman for a transition period and as of january 1, 2015 mr. zuckerman serves as the non-executive chairman of the board. in connection with the succession, mr. zuckerman entered into a transition benefits agreement with us. the agreement provided that if mr. zuckerman remains employed by us through july 1, 2014, he would be entitled to receive, on january 1, 2015, a lump sum cash payment of $6.7 million and an equity award with a targeted value of approximately $11.1 million. the cash payment and equity award vested one-third on each of march 10, 2013, october 1, 2013 and july 1, 2014. as a result, we recognized approximately $13.8 million of compensation expense during the year ended december 31, 2013. we recognized approximately $4.0 million of compensation expense over the remaining vesting period and, accordingly, expensed approximately $4.0 million in 2014. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2013, we accelerated the remaining approximately $12.9 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with mr. zuckermans unvested long-term equity awards. during the year ended december 31, 2012, we recognized approximately $4.6 million of amortization that occurred prior to the accelerated vesting of the $12.9 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the transition benefits agreement. the remaining increase was primarily due to (1) an approximately $2.6 million increase related to the issuance of the 2013 myltip units and non-qualified stock options, (2) an approximately $1.3 million increase in health insurance costs, (3) an approximately $1.7 million increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan, (4) an approximately $0.8 million increases in taxes and (5) an approximately $3.1 million increase in other general and administrative expenses, which includes compensation expenses. this increase was partially offset by (1) approximately $1.9 million of amortization that occurred for a member of senior management in 2012 that did not recur in 2013 due to the fact that this person reached retirement age and therefore became fully vested in time-based equity awards and we no longer recognized expense on a quarterly basis and (2) our recognition of approximately $4.5 million of expense during the first quarter of 2012 in connection with the resignation of e. mitchell norville, our chief operating officer, on february 29, 2012, which did not recur in 2013.
we have modified the presentation of expenses to operate our san francisco and princeton regional offices to reflect the growing activity in our san francisco region and to have a consistent presentation across our company. these expenses, which totaled approximately $8.1 million and $7.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, were previously included in rental operating expenses and are now included in general and administrative expenses for all periods presented.
wages directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. these costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. capitalized wages for the year ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 were approximately $12.8 million and $12.7 million, respectively. these costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above.
transaction costs during the year ended december 31, 2013 we incurred approximately $1.7 million of transaction costs of which approximately $0.6 million related to the acquisition of the mountain view research park and mountain view technology park properties in mountain view, california, approximately $0.4 million related to salesforce tower in san francisco, california, approximately $0.5 million related to transaction costs for transactions in new york city and approximately $0.2 million related to the pursuit of other transactions.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we incurred approximately $3.7 million of transaction pursuit costs of which approximately $0.6 million related to the acquisition of 680 folsom street in san francisco, california, approximately $0.5 million related to the acquisition of fountain square in reston, virginia,
86
approximately $0.3 million related to the forming of a joint venture to pursue the acquisition of land in san francisco, california to construct the salesforce tower, approximately $0.6 million related to the acquisition of 100 federal street in boston, massachusetts and approximately $1.7 million related to the pursuit of other transactions.
impairment loss on march 28, 2013, we executed a binding contract for the sale of our 303 almaden boulevard property located in san jose, california for a sale price of $40.0 million. the pending sale of this asset caused us to evaluate our strategy for development of the adjacent almaden land parcel which can accommodate approximately 840,000 square feet of office development. based on a shorter than expected hold period, we reduced the carrying value of the land parcel to its fair market value and recognized an impairment loss of approximately $8.3 million during the three months ended march 31, 2013.
other income and expense items income from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 2012, income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased by approximately $26.0 million due primarily to (1) an increase of approximately $41.1 million in our share of net income from the sale of 125 west 55th street on may 30, 2013 and (2) an increase of approximately $11.3 million in our share of net income from the sale of the eighth avenue and 46th street project in new york city partially offset by the following: (1) an approximately $21.0 million decrease in our share of net income from 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building) related to the consolidation on june 1, 2013 and termination income that was received during 2012 that did not recur in 2013, (2) an approximately $3.2 million decrease in our share of net income from 540 madison avenue due to lease expirations, (3) an approximately $1.1 million decrease in our share of net income from the value-added fund due to our acquisition of the mountain view assets on april 10, 2013 which includes approximately $0.2 million of gain recognized during 2012 related to the sale of 300 billerica road in chelmsford, massachusetts and (4) an approximately $1.1 million decrease in our share of net income from our other unconsolidated joint ventures.
on july 19, 2013, a joint venture in which we have a 50% interest completed the sale of its eighth avenue and 46th street project located in new york city for an imputed sale price of $45.0 million. eighth avenue and 46th street is comprised of an assemblage of land parcels and air-rights. net cash proceeds to us totaled approximately $21.8 million, after the payment of transaction costs. the joint venture had previously recognized an impairment loss on the property. as a result, the joint venture recognized a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $12.6 million, of which our share was approximately $11.3 million.
on may 31, 2013, our two joint venture partners in 767 venture, llc (the entity that owns 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building) in new york city) transferred all of their interests in the joint venture to third parties. in connection with the transfer, we and our new joint venture partners modified our relative decision making authority and consent rights with respect to the joint ventures assets and operations. these changes resulted in us having sufficient financial and operating control over 767 venture, llc such that we now account for the assets, liabilities and operations of 767 venture, llc on a consolidated basis in our financial statements instead of under the equity method of accounting. our ownership interest in 767 venture, llc remained unchanged at 60%. due to the consolidation effective june 1, 2013, only five months of activity are being shown for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to a full year in 2012 resulting in a decrease in income from unconsolidated joint ventures of approximately $9.2 million. in aggregate, the total decrease, which includes the termination income detailed below, and the decrease in income due to consolidation is approximately $21.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 2012.
87
on may 14, 2012, an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a 60% interest entered into a lease termination agreement with an existing tenant at 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building) in new york city. under the agreement, the tenant terminated early its lease for approximately 36,000 square feet at the building and is responsible for certain payments to the unconsolidated joint venture aggregating approximately $28.4 million through may 1, 2014 (of which our share is approximately $17.0 million). as a result of the termination, we recognized termination income totaling approximately $11.8 million (which is net of the write-off of the accrued straight-line rent balance) during the year ended ended december 31, 2012.
on may 30, 2013, a joint venture in which we have a 60% interest completed the sale of its 125 west 55th street property located in new york city for a sale price of $470.0 million, including the assumption by the buyer of the mortgage loan collateralized by the property totaling approximately $198.6 million. the mortgage loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.09% per annum and was scheduled to mature on march 10, 2020. net cash proceeds totaled approximately $253.7 million, of which our share was approximately $152.2 million, after the payment of transaction costs. 125 west 55th street is a class a office property totaling approximately 588,000 net rentable square feet. we had previously recognized an impairment loss on our investment in the unconsolidated joint venture. as a result, we recognized a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $43.2 million. due to the sale on may 30, 2013, only five months of activity are being shown for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to a full year in 2012 resulting in a decrease in income from unconsolidated joint ventures of approximately $2.1 million.
on april 10, 2013, we acquired the mountain view research park and mountain view technology park properties from the value-added fund for an aggregate net purchase price of approximately $233.1 million. prior to the acquisition, our ownership interest in the properties was approximately 39.5%. as a result of the acquisition, we owned 100% of the properties and accounted for them on a consolidated basis. due to the acquisition, the value-added fund, excluding the gain on the sale of 300 billerica road in chelmsford, massachusetts, contributed an approximately $1.3 million loss to our share of the income for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 2012.
for the consolidated operating results for 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building), mountain view research park and mountain view technology park refer to results of operationsproperties acquired portfolio within item 7managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
gains on consolidation of joint ventures on april 10, 2013, we acquired the mountain view research park and mountain view technology park properties from our value-added fund for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $233.5 million. prior to the acquisition, our ownership interest in the properties was approximately 39.5%. as a result of the acquisition, we own 100% of the properties and account for them on a consolidated basis. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recognized a gain on consolidation totaling approximately $26.5 million.
on may 31, 2013, our two joint venture partners in 767 venture, llc (the entity that owns 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building) in new york city) transferred all of their interests in the joint venture to third parties. in connection with the transfer, we and our new joint venture partners modified our relative decision making authority and consent rights with respect to the joint ventures assets and operations. these changes resulted in us having sufficient financial and operating control over 767 venture, llc such that we now account for the assets, liabilities and operations of 767 venture, llc on a consolidated basis in our financial statements instead of under the equity method of accounting. our ownership interest in 767 venture, llc remained unchanged at 60%. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recognized a non-cash gain on our investment of approximately $359.5 million. the gain on consolidation resulted from us recognizing the assets, liabilities and equity (including noncontrolling interests) of the joint venture at fair value on the date of consolidation resulting in the recognition of a gain on consolidation equal to the difference between the fair value
88
of our equity interest totaling approximately $721.3 million (as reflected in the business combination table appearing in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) and the carrying value of our previously held equity interest totaling approximately $361.8 million. the fair value was determined based on the purchase price paid by the new joint venture partners through a sales process managed by a major new york city sales brokerage firm.
interest and other income interest and other income decreased approximately $1.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 2012, of which $1.1 million was related to an insurance claim that we received during 2012 that did not recur in 2013 and the remaining decrease of approximately $0.7 million related to interest income. the decrease in interest income was due primarily to interest income that we recognized related to the loans that we made to our value-added fund. on april 10, 2013 we acquired the mountain view properties from the value-added fund and the loans were repaid. the loans to the value-added fund had been reflected in related party note receivable on our consolidated financial statements.
gains from investments in securities gains from investments in securities for the year ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to a deferred compensation plan that we maintain for our officers. under this deferred compensation plan, each officer who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officers current income on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer. in order to reduce our market risk relating to this plan, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer. this enables us to generally match our liabilities to our officers under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. the performance of these investments is recorded as gains from investments in securities. during the year ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, we recognized gains of approximately $2.9 million and $1.4 million, respectively, on these investments. by comparison, our general and administrative expense increased by approximately $2.9 million and $1.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, as a result of increases in our liability under our deferred compensation plan that were associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by our officers participating in the plan.
gains (losses) from early extinguishments of debt for the year ended december 31, 2013, we had a gain from early extinguishments of debt of approximately $0.1 million due to the following transactions:
on april 15, 2013, we announced that holders of our operating partnerships 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036 (the notes) had the right to surrender their notes for purchase by our operating partnership (the put right) on may 18, 2013. on april 15, 2013, we also announced that our operating partnership issued a notice of redemption to the holders of the notes to redeem, on may 18, 2013 (the redemption date), all of the notes outstanding on the redemption date. in connection with the notice of redemption, holders of the notes had the right to exchange their notes on or prior to may 16, 2013. notes with respect to which the put right was not exercised and that were not surrendered for exchange on or prior to may 16, 2013, were redeemed by our operating partnership at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. based on final information provided to our operating partnership by the trustee for the notes, no notes were validly tendered and accepted for purchase in the put right. pursuant to the notice of redemption, an aggregate principal amount of $990,000 of the notes was redeemed on may 18, 2013. the remaining aggregate principal amount of $449,010,000 of the notes was surrendered for exchange and, in addition to the repayment of the principal in cash, we issued an aggregate of
89
419,116 shares of our common stock in exchange for the notes. we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.1 million consisting of transaction costs.
on april 1, 2013, we used available cash to repay the mortgage loan collateralized by our 140 kendrick street property located in needham, massachusetts totaling approximately $47.6 million. the mortgage loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 7.51% per annum and was scheduled to mature on july 1, 2013. there was no prepayment penalty. we recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.3 million related to the acceleration of the remaining balance of the historical fair value debt adjustment, which was the result of purchase accounting.
for the year ended december 31, 2012, we had a loss from early extinguishments of debt of approximately $4.5 million due to the following transactions:
on september 4, 2012, we used available cash to repay the mortgage loan collateralized by our sumner square property located in washington, dc totaling approximately $23.2 million. the mortgage financing bore interest at a fixed rate of 7.35% per annum and was scheduled to mature on september 1, 2013. we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.3 million, which included a prepayment penalty totaling approximately $0.2 million associated with the early repayment.
on august 24, 2012, our operating partnership used available cash to redeem the remaining $225.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due 2013. the redemption price was determined in accordance with the applicable indenture and totaled approximately $231.6 million. the redemption price included approximately $1.5 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. excluding such accrued and unpaid interest, the redemption price was approximately 102.25% of the principal amount being redeemed. we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $5.2 million, which amount included the payment of the redemption premium totaling approximately $5.1 million.

discontinued operations on december 20, 2013, we completed the sale of our 10 & 20 burlington mall road property located in burlington, massachusetts for a sale price of approximately $30.0 million. net cash proceeds totaled approximately $29.4 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $20.5 million. 10 & 20 burlington mall road consists of two class a office properties aggregating approximately 152,000 net rentable square feet. the operating results of the property through the date of sale have been classified as discontinued operations on a historical basis for all periods presented.
on december 20, 2013, we completed the sale of our one preserve parkway property located in rockville, maryland for a sale price of approximately $61.3 million. net cash proceeds totaled approximately $59.9 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $5.9 million. one preserve parkway is a class a office property totaling approximately 184,000 net rentable square feet. the operating results of the property through the date of sale have been classified as discontinued operations on a historical basis for all periods presented.
on august 22, 2013, we completed the sale of our 1301 new york avenue property located in washington, dc for a net contract sale price of approximately $121.7 million. after adjusting for outstanding lease and other transaction costs assumed by the buyer, the gross sale price was approximately $135.0 million. net cash proceeds totaled approximately $121.5 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $86.4 million. 1301 new york avenue is a class a office property totaling approximately 201,000 net rentable square feet. the operating results of the property through the date of sale have been classified as discontinued operations on a historical basis for all periods presented.

liquidity and capital resources general our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to:
   fund normal recurring expenses;

   meet debt service and principal repayment obligations, including balloon payments on maturing debt;

   fund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs;

   fund development costs;

   fund dividend requirements on our series b preferred stock;

   redeem our operating partnerships series four preferred units:

   fund possible property acquisitions; and

   make the minimum distribution required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended.

we expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following:
   cash flow from operations;

   distribution of cash flows from joint ventures;

   cash and cash equivalent balances;

   issuances of our equity securities and/or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in our operating partnership;

   our operating partnerships unsecured line of credit or other short-term bridge facilities;

   construction loans;

   long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); and

   sales of real estate.

93
we draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. our current consolidated development properties are expected to be funded with our available cash balances. our operating partnerships unsecured line of credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, refinance outstanding indebtedness and meet short-term development and working capital needs. although we generally seek to fund our development projects with construction loans, which may be guaranteed by our operating partnership, the financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the projects size and duration, the extent of pre-leasing and our available cash and access to cost effective capital at the given time.

contractual rental revenue, recoveries from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances and draws on our operating partnerships unsecured line of credit are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to enable us to maintain our reit qualification. we seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our property management, leasing, and development and construction businesses, as well as the sale of assets from time to time. we believe our revenue, together with our cash balances and proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short-term liquidity needs.
material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows. such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund dividends and distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. in addition, a material adverse change in the cash provided by our operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial covenants under our operating partnerships unsecured line of credit and unsecured senior notes.
94
our primary use of capital will be the completion of our ongoing developments, which, through 2019, have remaining costs to fund of approximately $1.3 billion. we believe that our strong liquidity, including available cash as of february 23, 2015 of approximately $1.1 billion, which includes approximately $342.2 million of restricted cash which is being held for possible investment in a like-kind exchange in accordance with section 1031 of the internal revenue code, the approximately $983.5 million available under our operating partnerships unsecured line of credit and proceeds from potential asset sales provide sufficient capacity to meet our debt obligations and fund our remaining capital requirements on existing development projects and pursue additional attractive investment opportunities. we also have full availability under our $600 million atm program. given the relatively low interest rates currently available to us in the debt markets, we may seek to enhance our liquidity in the future, which may result in us carrying additional cash and cash equivalents pending our operating partnerships use of the proceeds, and we have entered and may consider entering into derivatives to hedge the interest rate risk associated with one or more future financings (see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements). we also may consider the early refinancing of our mortgages that expire in 2016 and 2017 which have a relatively high weighted-average coupon/stated interest rate of 5.9%, even though we may be obligated to pay prepayment charges. in order to reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption, we may also, from time to time, purchase unsecured senior notes for cash in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or both. we will evaluate any such potential transactions in light of then-existing market conditions, taking into account the trading prices of the notes, our current liquidity and prospects for future access to capital.
reit tax distribution considerations dividend as a reit we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we currently distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income (excluding capital gains and with certain other adjustments). our policy is to distribute at least 100% of our taxable income, including capital gains, to avoid paying federal tax. on december 2, 2013, we announced that our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of $2.25 per common share payable on january 29, 2014 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on december 31, 2013. the decision to declare a special dividend was primarily a result of the sale of a 45% interest in our times square tower property in october 2013. the board of directors did not make any change in our policy with respect to regular quarterly dividends. holders of common units of limited partnership interest in boston properties limited partnership, our operating partnership, as of the close of business on december 31, 2013 received the same distribution on january 29, 2014. on december 8, 2014, we announced that our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of $4.50 per common share payable on january 28, 2015 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on december 31, 2014. the decision to declare a special dividend was primarily a result of the taxable gains associated with the sale of approximately $2.3 billion of assets during 2014 partially offset by our election to deduct costs that were capitalized in prior years that may now be deducted under the new tangible property regulations, discussed below. the board of directors did not make any change in our policy with respect to regular quarterly dividends. holders of common units of limited partnership interest in boston properties limited partnership, our operating partnership, as of the close of business on december 31, 2014 received the same distribution on january 28, 2015. our board of directors will continue to evaluate our dividend rate in light of our actual and projected taxable income, liquidity requirements and other circumstances, and there can be no assurance that the future dividends declared by our board of directors will not differ materially.
application of recent regulations in september 2013, the internal revenue service released final regulations governing when taxpayers like us must capitalize and depreciate costs for acquiring, maintaining, repairing and replacing tangible property and when they can deduct such costs. these final regulations are effective for tax years beginning on or after january 1, 2014. these regulations permitted us to deduct certain types of expenditures that were previously
95
required to be capitalized by us. they also allowed us to make a one-time election to immediately deduct certain amounts that were capitalized in previous years that are not required to be capitalized under the new regulations. we analyzed how the application of the new regulations affects our business and decided to make the election for the 2014 tax year. although such an election had an immaterial impact on our gaap financial statements or funds from operations, it materially reduced our taxable income and therefore our dividend payout requirements under applicable reit tax regulations for 2014. it also could have an impact on our dividend payout requirements in future years, as the amounts deducted in 2014 will no longer be depreciated over time, and amounts expended and deducted in future periods will vary, potentially resulting in more variation in our distribution requirement from year to year depending on our annual cost of now-deductible expenditures that previously would have been capitalized. although we made the election for tax year 2014, there can be no assurance concerning the impact, if any, on the dividends declared by our board of directors in future taxable years.
sales to the extent that we sell assets at a gain and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, we would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the cost and availability of capital from other sources, the price of our common stock and reit distribution requirements. at a minimum, we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales.
cash flow summary the following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.
cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.8 billion and $2.4 billion at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, representing an decrease of approximately $0.6 billion. the following table sets forth changes in cash flows:

net cash used in investing activities                            (665,124   )                 (532,640   )                 (132,484     )
net cash provided by (used in) financing activities              (632,487   )                1,077,873                     (1,710,360   )
our principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our office properties. the average term of our in-place tenant leases, including our unconsolidated joint ventures, is approximately 6.8 years with occupancy rates historically in the range of 91% to 94%. our properties generate a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. in addition, over the past several years, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our properties, secured and unsecured borrowings and equity offerings.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, our total dividend payments exceeded our cash flow from operating activities due to the special dividend which was declared in december 2013 and paid to common stockholders and common unitholders of our operating partnership in january 2014. the cash flows distributed were
96
primarily a result of the sale of a 45% interest in our times square tower property in october 2013 and were included as part of cash flows provided by financing activities. dividends will generally exceed cash flows from operating activities during periods in which we sell significant real estate assets and the distribution of gains occurs in a different period.
cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development, net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. we selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings to enhance or maintain their market position. cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 consisted primarily of funding our development projects, acquisitions and the proceeds from the sales of real estate, as detailed below:

cash used in investing activities changed primarily due to the following:
   on february 6, 2013, we completed the acquisition of 535 mission street, a development site, in san francisco, california for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $71.0 million in cash, including work completed and materials purchased to date.

          on march 26, 2013, the consolidated joint venture in which we have a 95% interest completed the acquisition of a land parcel in san francisco, california which will support a 61-story, 1.4 million square foot office salesforce tower. the purchase price for the land was approximately $192.0 million.

   on march 29, 2013, we completed the acquisition of a parcel of land located in reston, virginia for a purchase price of approximately $27.0

                                                       on april 10, 2013, we acquired the mountain view research park and mountain view technology park properties from our value-added fund for an aggregate net purchase price of approximately $233.1 million. mountain view research park is a 16-building complex of office/technical properties aggregating approximately 604,000 net rentable square feet. mountain view technology park is a seven-building complex of office/technical properties aggregating approximately 135,000 net rentable square feet. in conjunction with the acquisition, the value-added fund repaid the mountain view research park and mountain view technology park properties outstanding loans payable to our operating partnership totaling approximately $8.6 million and $3.7 million, respectively.

         on november 6, 2014, we entered into an option agreement pursuant to which we have been granted an option to purchase real property located at 425
fourth street in san francisco, california. in connection with the execution of the agreement, we paid a non-refundable option payment to the current owner of

97
$1.0 million. we intend to pursue the entitlements necessary to develop the property. the purchase price has not been determined and is dependent on the entitlements obtained. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the desired entitlements or that we will ultimately determine to exercise the option.

                                                   on november 12, 2014, we completed the acquisition of a parcel of land at 804 carnegie center in princeton, new jersey for a purchase price of approximately $3.7 million. 804 carnegie center is a build-to-suit project with approximately 130,000 net rentable square feet of class a office space which is currently under construction. we expect that the building will be complete and available for occupancy during the first quarter of 2016.

98
                                               on october 2, 2014, we completed the sale of patriots park located in reston, virginia for a gross sale price of $321.0 million. patriots park consists of three class a office properties aggregating approximately 706,000 net rentable square feet. net cash proceeds totaled approximately $319.1 million. as of december 31, 2014, we have placed in escrow approximately $320.2

       capital contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures primarily increased due to cash contributions of approximately $39.0 million, $5.4 million and
$4.2 million to our 1001 6th street (formerly known as 501 k street), annapolis junction and north station (phase 1 -air rights) joint ventures, respectively.

           capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased by approximately $224.4 million due to the sale of the eighth avenue and 46th street project and 125 west 55th street in new york city and the value-added fund selling mountain view research and technology parks during the year ended december 31, 2013.

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 totaled approximately $632.5 million. this consisted primarily of us selling a 45% interest in each of 601 lexington avenue in new york city and atlantic wharf office building and 100 federal street in boston, the repayment at maturity of $747.5 million of 3.625% exchangeable senior notes due 2014, the repayment of $300 million of 5.625% and $250 million of 5.000% unsecured senior notes due in 2015, the payments of regular and special dividends and distributions to our shareholders and unitholders and repayment of secured mortgage debt. future debt payments are discussed below under the heading capitalization-debt financing.
capitalization at december 31, 2014, our total consolidated debt was approximately $9.9 billion. the gaap weighted-average annual interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness was 4.40% (with a coupon/stated rate of 4.98%) and the weighted-average maturity was approximately 5.0 years.
consolidated debt to total consolidated market capitalization ratio, defined as total consolidated debt as a percentage of the value of our outstanding equity securities plus our total consolidated debt, is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the reit sector. our total consolidated market capitalization was approximately $32.1 billion at december 31, 2014. our total consolidated market capitalization was calculated using the december 31, 2014 closing stock price of $128.69 per common share and the following: (1) 153,113,945 shares of our common stock, (2) 16,453,670 outstanding common units of partnership interest in our operating partnership (excluding common units held by us), (3) an aggregate of 1,496,799 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding ltip units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the ltip units, (4) 12,667 series four preferred units of partnership interest in our operating partnership multiplied by the fixed liquidation preference of $50 per unit, (5) 80,000 shares (8,000,000 depositary shares, each representing 1/100th of a share) of our 5.25% series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock, at a price of $2,500 per share ($25 per depositary share) and (6) our consolidated debt totaling approximately $9.9 billion. our total consolidated debt, which excludes debt collateralized by our unconsolidated joint ventures, at december 31, 2014, represented approximately 30.84% of our total consolidated market capitalization.
99
following the consolidation of 767 venture, llc (the entity that owns 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building)), effective june 1, 2013, our consolidated debt increased significantly compared to prior periods even though our economic interest in 767 venture, llc remained substantially unchanged. as a result, we believe the presentation of total adjusted debt may provide investors with a more complete picture of our share of consolidated and unconsolidated debt. total adjusted debt is defined as our total consolidated debt, plus our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt, minus our joint venture partners share of consolidated debt, and was approximately $9.1 billion at december 31, 2014. in addition, in light of the difference between our total consolidated debt and our total adjusted debt, we believe that also presenting our total adjusted debt to total adjusted market capitalization ratio may provide investors with a more complete picture of our leverage in relation to the overall size of our company. the calculation of the total adjusted debt to total adjusted market capitalization ratio is the same as consolidated debt to total consolidated market capitalization ratio except that the total adjusted debt balance is used in lieu of the total consolidated debt balance. our total adjusted debt at december 31, 2014, represented approximately 29.01% of our total adjusted market capitalization the calculation of total consolidated and adjusted market capitalization does not include 394,590 2012 opp units, 313,936 2013 myltip units and 482,032 2014 myltip units because, unlike other ltip units, they are not earned until certain return thresholds are achieved. these percentages will fluctuate with changes in the market value of our common stock and does not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. however, for a company like ours, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, the consolidated debt to total consolidated market capitalization ratio and the adjusted debt to total adjusted market capitalization ratio may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as it is evaluated along with other financial ratios and the various components of our outstanding indebtedness.
for a discussion of our unconsolidated joint venture indebtedness, see liquidity and capital resourcescapitalizationoff-balance sheet arrangementsjoint venture indebtedness within item 7managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

debt financing as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately $9.9 billion of outstanding consolidated indebtedness, representing approximately 30.84% of our total consolidated market capitalization as calculated above consisting of approximately (1) $5.288 billion (net of discount) in publicly traded unsecured senior notes (excluding exchangeable senior notes) having a gaap weighted-average interest rate of 4.42% per annum and maturities in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2023 and 2024; (2) $4.3 billion of property-specific mortgage debt having a gaap weighted-average interest rate of 4.30% per annum and weighted-average term of 3.2 years and (3) $0.3 million of mezzanine notes payable associated with 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building), having a gaap interest rate of 5.53% per annum and maturing in 2017. the table below summarizes our mortgage and mezzanine notes payable, our unsecured senior notes and our unsecured line of credit at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013:

also contains a competitive bid option that allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loan advances to our operating partnership at a reduced interest rate. in addition, our operating partnership is also obligated to pay (1) in quarterly installments a facility fee on the total commitment at a rate per annum ranging from 0.125% to 0.35% based on our operating partnerships credit rating and (2) an annual fee on the undrawn amount of each letter of credit equal to the libor margin. based on our operating partnerships current credit rating, the libor and cdor margin is 1.00%, the alternate base rate margin is 0.0% and the facility fee is 0.15%. our ability to borrow under our operating partnerships unsecured line of credit is subject to our compliance with a number of customary financial and other covenants on an ongoing basis, including:
   a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within one year;

(3)                                            in connection with the assumption of the loan, we guaranteed the joint ventures obligation to fund various escrows, including tenant improvements, taxes and insurance in lieu of cash deposits. as of december 31, 2014, the maximum funding obligation under the guarantee was approximately $32.0 million. we earn a fee from the joint venture for providing the guarantee and have an agreement with our partners to reimburse the joint venture for their share of any payments made under the guarantee.

6.10% per annum. under our interest rate hedging program, we are reclassifying into earnings over the eight-year term of the loan as an increase in interest expense approximately $26.4 million (approximately $3.3 million per year) of the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets within accumulated other comprehensive loss resulting in an effective interest rate of 7.02% per annum.

(9)   this property is owned by a consolidated joint venture in which we have a 50% interest.

outside members notes payable in conjunction with the consolidation of 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building), we recorded loans payable to the joint ventures partners totaling $450.0 million and related accrued interest payable totaling approximately $175.8 million. the member loans bear interest at a fixed rate of 11.0% per annum and mature on june 9, 2017. we have eliminated in consolidation our member loan totaling $270.0 million and our share of the related accrued interest payable of approximately $133.0 million at december 31, 2014. the remaining notes payable to the outside joint venture partners and related accrued interest payable totaling $180.0 million and approximately $88.6 million as of december 31, 2014 have been reflected as outside members notes payable and within accrued interest payable, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. the related interest expense from the outside members notes payable totaling approximately $28.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 is fully allocated to the outside joint venture partners as an adjustment to noncontrolling interests in property partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations.
market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. the fair value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. we manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term, fixed-rate, non-recourse debt of similar duration. we continue to follow a conservative strategy of generally pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy tenants in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. all of our outstanding
104
debt, excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures, has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of such outstanding debt. we also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial institutions. our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions. this in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. our strategy mitigates against future increases in our interest rates.
at december 31, 2014 our weighted-average coupon/stated rate on all of our outstanding debt, all of which had a fixed interest rate, was 4.98% per annum. at december 31, 2014, we had no outstanding variable rate debt. the weighted-average coupon/stated rate for our senior notes was 4.34%.

(computed in accordance with gaap, including non-recurring items) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable real estate of consolidated real estate, impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and preferred distributions. ffo is a non-gaap financial measure. the use of ffo, combined with the required primary gaap presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful. management generally considers ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate of consolidated real estate, impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. our computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently. amount represents our share, which was 89.81%, 89.99%, 89.48%, 88.57% and 87.25% for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, after allocation to the noncontrolling interests in the operating partnership.
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to boston properties, inc. (determined in accordance with gaap) as an indication of our performance. ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. we believe that to further understand our performance, ffo should be compared with our reported net income attributable to boston properties, inc. and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with gaap, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.

net operating income net operating income, or noi, is a non-gaap financial measure equal to net income attributable to boston properties, inc., the most directly comparable gaap financial measure, plus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, impairment loss from discontinued operations, losses (gains) from early extinguishments of debt, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, suspension of development, impairment loss, transaction costs and general and administrative expense, less gain on forgiveness of debt from discontinued operations, gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, income from discontinued operations, gains on sales of real estate, gains (losses) from investments in securities, interest and other income, gains on consolidation of joint ventures, income from unconsolidated joint ventures and development and management services revenue. we use noi internally as a performance measure and believe noi provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. therefore, we believe noi is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets.
our management also uses noi to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. further, we believe noi is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, noi reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to boston properties, inc. noi excludes certain components from net income attributable to boston properties, inc. in order to provide results that are more closely related to our properties results of operations. for example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. in addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. noi presented by us may not be comparable to noi reported by other reits and real estate companies that define noi differently. we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, noi should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to boston properties, inc. as presented in our consolidated financial statements. noi should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to boston properties, inc. as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions.

we have various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to our property management. in addition, we have certain other contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year. these contracts are not included as part of our contractual obligations because they include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. contract terms are generally between three to five years.
during 2014, we paid approximately $205.1 million to fund tenant-related obligations, including tenant improvements and leasing commissions, and incurred approximately $426 million of new tenant-related obligations associated with approximately 6.4 million square feet of second generation leases, or approximately $65 per square foot. in addition, we signed leases for approximately 1.3 million square feet at our development properties. the tenant-related obligations for the development properties are included within the projects estimated total investment referred to in item 7managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources. in the aggregate, during 2014, we signed leases for approximately 7.7 million square feet of space and incurred aggregate tenant-related obligations of approximately $553 million, or approximately $72 per square foot.
off-balance sheet arrangementsjoint venture indebtedness we have investments in unconsolidated joint ventures with our effective ownership interests ranging from 25% to 60%. six of these joint ventures have mortgage indebtedness. we exercise significant influence over, but
110
do not control, these entities and therefore they are presently accounted for using the equity method of accounting. see also note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. at december 31, 2014, the aggregate carrying amount of debt, including both our and our partners share, incurred by these ventures was approximately $830.1 million (of which our proportionate share is approximately $351.5 million). the table below summarizes the outstanding debt of these joint venture properties at december 31, 2014. from time to time, we (or the applicable joint venture) have also agreed to guarantee portions of the principal, interest or other amounts in connection with other unconsolidated joint venture borrowings. in addition, we have agreed to customary construction completion guarantees for construction loans, environmental indemnifications and nonrecourse carve-outs (e.g., guarantees against fraud, misrepresentation and bankruptcy) on certain of the loans.

environmental matters it is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update phase i environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties. these pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect. however, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action.
in february 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from exxon corporation a property in massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. we developed an office park on the property. we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. under the property acquisition agreement, exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and
111
discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges.
environmental investigations at some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. in each case we engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments, and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities. in each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. we also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases. although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take such further response actions (if any) that we deem necessary or advisable. other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time.
some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical use of the areas have caused site contamination. accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. in these situations it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. we then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition and/or development of the property. for example, we own a parcel in massachusetts which was formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility. pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contained relatively low levels of certain contaminants. we have developed an office park on this property. prior to and during redevelopment activities, we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. a submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site. the submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws.
we expect that resolution of the environmental matters described above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. however, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties, that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, or that we will have insurance coverage in the event that such environmental liabilities arise.
out of period adjustment, revision and adoption of new accounting pronouncements out of period adjustment during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded an allocation of net income to the noncontrolling interest holder in our fountain square consolidated joint venture totaling approximately $1.9 million related to the cumulative non-cash adjustment to the accretion of the changes in the redemption value of the noncontrolling interest. this resulted in the overstatement of noncontrolling interests in property partnerships by approximately $1.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 and an understatement of noncontrolling interests in property partnerships in the aggregate amount of approximately $1.9 million in periods prior to 2014. because this adjustment was not material to the prior periods consolidated financial statements and the impact of
112
recording the adjustment in 2014 was not material to our consolidated financial statements, we recorded the related adjustment during the year ended december 31, 2014. the out of period adjustment was identified and recorded during the second quarter of 2014.
revision during the fourth quarter of 2014, we revised the presentation of certain investments in unconsolidated joint ventures with deficit balances to reflect the deficit balances within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets instead of within investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. the revision resulted in an aggregate of approximately $14.0 million at december 31, 2013 being presented within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, which revision was not material to the period.
recent accounting pronouncements on april 10, 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity (asu 2014-08). asu 2014-08 clarifies that discontinued operations presentation applies only to disposals representing a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results (e.g., a disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment or other major parts of an entity). asu 2014-08 is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2014. early adoption is permitted, and the company early adopted asu 2014-08 during the first quarter of 2014. our adoption of asu 2014-08 resulted in the operating results and gains on sales of real estate from operating properties sold during the year ended december 31, 2014 not being reflected within discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contract with customers (topic 606) (asu 2014-09). the objective of asu 2014-09 is to establish a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. the core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. in applying asu 2014-09, companies will perform a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. asu 2014-09 applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the fasbs accounting standards codification (asc). asu 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim periods within that reporting period) beginning after december 15, 2016 and shall be applied using either a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach. early adoption is not permitted. we are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of asu 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
in june 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-12, accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period (asu 2014-12). the amendments in asu 2014-12 require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. a reporting entity should apply existing guidance in asc topic no. 718, compensationstock compensation (asc 718), as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. the amendments in asu 2014-12 are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december 15, 2015. early adoption is permitted. entities may apply the amendments in asu 2014-12 either: (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. we do not expect the adoption of asu 2014-12 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
113
in august 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-15, presentation of financial statementsgoing concern: disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern (asu 2014-15). asu 2014-15 requires an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable) and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. asu 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after december 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted. we do not expect the adoption of asu 2014-15 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in november 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-16, determining whether the host contract in a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share is more akin to debt or to equity (asu 2014-16). asu 2014-16 clarifies how current gaap should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. specifically, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider all relevant terms and featuresincluding the embedded derivative feature being evaluated for bifurcationin evaluating the nature of the host contract. furthermore, the amendments clarify that no single term or feature would necessarily determine the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. rather, the nature of the host contract depends upon the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument. asu 2014-16 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015. early adoption is permitted. we do not expect the adoption of asu 2014-16 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in february 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-02, consolidation (topic 810): amendments to the consolidation analysis (asu 2015-02). asu 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. asu 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are vies or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with vies, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. asu 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2015. early adoption is permitted. a reporting entity may apply the amendments in asu 2015-02 using: (a) a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption; or (b) by applying the amendments retrospectively. we are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of asu 2015-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
inflation substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations over a base amount. in addition, many of our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. we believe that inflationary increases in costs may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and operating expense escalations.

at december 31, 2014, the weighted-average coupon/stated rates on all of our outstanding debt, all of which had a fixed interest rate, was 4.98% per annum. at december 31, 2014 we had no outstanding variable rate debt. the weighted-average coupon/stated rates for our unsecured debt was 4.34% per annum.
the fair value amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure.

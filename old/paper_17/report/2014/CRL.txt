item 1a.    risk factors set forth below, elsewhere in this form 10-k and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this form 10-k. we note that factors set forth below, individually or in the aggregate, may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
the outsourcing trend in preclinical (discovery and safety assessment) stages of drug discovery and development may decrease, which could impair our growth.
13
over the past decade, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have generally increased their outsourcing of preclinical research support activities, such as discovery and safety assessment. while many industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue to increase for the next several years (although with different growth rates for different phases of drug discovery and development), decreases in such outsourcing may result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of any one or more of our service lines and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing outsourcing demand from our clients, please see the section entitled "our strategy" included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
a reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business.
our clients include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on molecules in the preclinical phases of research and development (and in particular discovery and safety assessment) and to outsource the products and services we provide. fluctuations in the expenditure amounts in each phase of the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, spending priorities (including available resources of our biotechnology clients, particularly those that are cash-negative, who may be highly focused on rationing their liquid assets in a challenging funding environment), general economic conditions and institutional budgetary policies. our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in drug research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as by academic institutions, government laboratories or private foundations. in particular, studies in recent years have indicated that a majority of academic researchers are anticipating reductions in their budgets.  similarly, economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries, also affect their research and development budgets and, consequentially, our business as well. the economic downturn has also negatively affected us to the extent that the spending by our global pharmaceutical clients has been directed towards their therapies in late-stage clinical rather than early-stage preclinical development as they work to replenish drug pipelines to offset the effect of patent expirations on sales. furthermore, our clients (particularly larger biopharmaceutical companies) continue to search for ways to maximize the return on their investments with a focus on leaner research and development costs per drug candidate. for additional discussion of the factors that we believe have recently been influencing research and development budgets at our clients, please see the sections entitled "our strategy" and "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
a reduction or delay in government funding of research and development may adversely affect our business.
a portion of revenue in our rms segment is derived from clients at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources such as the u.s. national institutes of health (nih) and similar domestic and international agencies, which can be difficult to forecast. government funding of research and development is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. our sales may be adversely affected if our clients delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals. also, government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities. other programs, such as homeland security or defense, or general efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit could be viewed by the u.s. government as a higher priority. these budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations in the future to government agencies that fund research and development activities. although the obama administration's stimulus packages in 2009 and 2010 included increases in nih funding, nih funding had otherwise remained fairly flat in recent years. a reduction in government funding for the nih or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results.  also, there is no guarantee that nih funding will be directed towards projects and studies that require use of our products and services.
several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply, which if interrupted could adversely affect our business.
we depend on a limited international source of supply for certain products, such as large research models. disruptions to their continued supply may arise from health problems, export or import laws/restrictions or embargoes, international trade regulations, foreign government or economic instability, severe weather conditions, increased competition amongst suppliers for models, disruptions to the air travel system, commercial disputes, supplier insolvency, or other normal-course or unanticipated events. any disruption of supply could harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms.
14
changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries, including potential health care reform, could decrease the need for the services we provide.
governmental agencies throughout the world, but particularly in the u.s., strictly regulate the drug development process. our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, among others, navigate the regulatory drug approval process. accordingly, many regulations, and often new regulations, are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries. however, some changes in regulations, such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of streamlined or expedited drug approval procedures, or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive, could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services.
although we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with national, regional and local laws as well as other accepted guidance used by oversight bodies (which include the usda, the standards set by the international air transport association, the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora, u.s. fish and wildlife service, the centers for disease control, the department of transportation, the office of laboratory animal welfare of nih as well as numerous other canadian, european and asian oversight agencies), failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions. in addition, if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety assessment procedures which utilize laboratory animals (as has been advocated by certain groups), certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected.
in march 2010, the u.s. congress enacted health care reform legislation intended over time to expand health insurance coverage and impose health industry cost containment measures. in june 2012, the u.s. supreme court upheld the constitutionality of this legislation. the court's decision allows implementation of key provisions impacting drug manufacturers going forward including, but not limited to, (1) expansion of access to health insurance coverage, (2) expansion of the medicaid program, (3) enactment of an industry fee on pharmaceutical companies, and (4) imposition of an excise tax on the sale of medical devices. since the law and its implementation continue to face challenges in congress and federal courts, and from certain state governments, opposition advocacy groups, and some small business organizations, we are uncertain as to the effects of this legislation on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future.
implementation of health care reform legislation may have certain benefits but also may contain costs that could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs. this could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the u.s. and abroad. in addition, new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability, increase our costs or limit our service offerings. furthermore, if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products, our clients may spend less, or reduce their growth in spending on research and development.
the fda is in the process of reviewing and modernizing the glp regulations to reflect current industry standards. as this may change some of the glp requirements, the regulatory impact will not be known until the final regulations are issued.
we are at risk that changes in u.s. government practices may negatively affect our business since it is a significant customer of ours. for example, in 2014, the national cancer institute (nci) canceled a 10-year, $112 million contract that was originally initiated in 2006, which had two years remaining. under the contract, we produced nci research models for academic and government researchers. in an effort to mitigate the effect of the cancellation, we launched an outreach program to inform researchers that they could continue to obtain the nci models from us, with no change in initial pricing or logistics. from a revenue standpoint, we received between $10 and $11 million annually to produce the models, and expect that we will retain approximately half of that amount from direct sales to researchers.
contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory, harm our reputation for contaminant-free production, result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs.
our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain infectious agents such as certain viruses and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health. the presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminant-free research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including gems, harm our reputation for contaminant-free production and result in decreased sales.
contaminations typically require cleaning up, renovating, disinfecting, retesting and restarting production or services. such clean-ups result in inventory loss, clean-up and start-up costs, and reduced sales as a result of lost client orders and credits for prior shipments. in addition to microbiological contaminations, the potential for genetic mix-ups or mis-matings also exists and
15
may require the restarting of the applicable colonies. while this does not require the complete clean-up, renovation and disinfection of the barrier room, it would likely result in inventory loss, additional start-up costs and possibly reduced sales. contaminations also expose us to risks that clients will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements. there also exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our client's facilities, with similar impact to them. in some cases, we may produce or import animals carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in humans; and in the case of such a contamination or undiagnosed infection, there could be a possible risk of human exposure and infection.
we are also subject to similar contamination risks with respect to our large research models. while often we own these models, they may be maintained on our behalf at a site operated by the original provider. accordingly, risk of contamination may be outside of our control, and we depend on the practices and protocols of third parties to ensure a contamination-free environment. furthermore, while we often negotiate for contractual risk indemnification, we may be exposed in the event of such contaminations if the third party does not fulfill its indemnification obligation or is unable to as a result of insolvency or other impediments.
all such contaminations described above are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results. many of our operations are comprised of complex mechanical systems which are subject to periodic failure, including aging fatigue. such failures are unpredictable, and while we have made significant capital expenditures designed to create redundancy within these mechanical systems, strengthen our biosecurity, improve our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations, and replace impaired systems and equipment in advance of such events, failures and/or contaminations may still occur.
any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results, and compliance with new regulations and guidance may result in additional costs.
any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities. this could harm our reputation, our prospects for future work and our operating results. for example, the issuance of a notice of objectionable observations or a warning from the fda based on a finding of a material violation by us for good laboratory practice or current good manufacturing practice requirements could materially and adversely affect us. if our operations are found to violate any applicable law or other governmental regulations, we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines. any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management's attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation.
in addition, regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of laboratory animals for research purposes continues to be updated. notably, the european directive 2010/63/eu requires new standards for animal housing and accommodations that require implementation by 2017. some of these new standards require additional operating and capital expenses that will impact not only us and our industry competitors, but clients in the biomedical research community through both changes in the pricing of goods and services and changes in their own operations.
similarly, guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community on both a national and international basis including transportation, mandated contingency planning, euthanasia guidance, import and export requirements of biological materials, health monitoring requirements and the use of disinfectants.
our revenue generating agreements contain termination and service reduction provisions or may otherwise terminate according to their term, which may result in less contract revenue than we anticipate.
many of our agreements with both large and small clients, including those which underlie our strategic relationships with some of our more significant customers, provide for termination or reduction in scope with little or no notice. in addition, we sell our products and services to our competitors, and similarly they sell products and services to us. for instance, we have historically entered into, and currently are party to, contracts with certain of our competitors to distribute specialty research models in locations where our competitors may not have distribution capabilities.
clients and/or competitors may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons including:
•   the products being tested fail to satisfy safety requirements;
•   unexpected or undesired study results;
•   production problems resulting in shortages of the drug being tested;
•   a client's decision to forego or terminate a particular study;
•   establishment of alternative distribution channels by our competitors;
16
•   the loss of funding for the particular research study; or
•   general convenience/counterparty preference.
if a client or competitor terminates a contract with us, we are typically entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and, in some cases, termination fees. cancellation of a large contract or proximate delay, cancellation or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business and, therefore, may adversely affect our operating results.
many of our contracts are fixed price and may be delayed or terminated or reduced in scope for reasons beyond our control, or we may under‐price or overrun cost estimates with these contracts, potentially resulting in financial losses.
many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or fee-for-service with a cap basis and, accordingly, we bear the financial risk if we initially under-price our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates. in addition, these contracts may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice. cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons, and often at the discretion of the client. the loss, reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business, although our contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects, as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination. some contracts also entitle us to a predetermined termination fee and irrevocably committed costs/expenses.
we could experience a breach of the confidentiality of the information we hold or of the security of our computer systems.
we operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts of client data. as a routine element of our business, we collect, analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the preclinical studies we conduct for our clients. unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such computer systems for the purpose of stealing data or disrupting the systems. we believe that we have taken appropriate measures to protect them from intrusion, and we continue to improve and enhance our systems in this regard, but in the event that our efforts are unsuccessful we could suffer significant harm. our contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from these studies. in the event the confidentiality of such information was compromised, we could suffer significant harm.
impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may adversely impact future results of operations.
we have intangible assets, including goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses. the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates. these estimates are based on, among other factors, input from accredited valuation consultants, reviews of projected future income cash flows and statutory regulations. the use of alternative estimates and assumptions might have increased or decreased the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets that could potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations.
if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated and/or our market capitalization declines, this could impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles. to the extent goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles are impaired, their carrying value will be written down to its implied fair value and a charge will be made to our income from continuing operations. such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results. as of december 27, 2014, the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles was $500.0 million on our consolidated balance sheet.
our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally.
a significant part of our revenue is derived from operations outside the u.s. our international revenues, which include revenues from our non-u.s. subsidiaries, have represented approximately one-half of our total revenue in recent years. we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future. there are a number of risks associated with our international business including:
•   foreign currencies we receive for sales and in which we record expenses outside the u.s. could be subject to unfavorable exchange rates with the u.s. dollar and reduce the amount of revenue and cash flow (and increase the amount of expenses) that we recognize and cause fluctuations in reported financial results;
•   certain contracts, particularly in canada, are frequently denominated in currencies other than the currency in which we incur expenses related to those contracts and where expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which contracts are priced, fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations;
17
•   general economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate;
•   potential international conflicts, including terrorist acts;
•   potential trade restrictions, exchange controls, adverse tax consequences, and legal restrictions on the repatriation of funds into the u.s.;
•   difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations, including risks of work stoppages and/or strikes, as well as violations of local laws or anti-bribery laws such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the uk bribery act, and the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions;
•   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;
•   the difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations;
•   unfavorable labor regulations in foreign jurisdictions;
•   potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of us and foreign tax laws;
•   exposure to business disruption or property damage due to geographically unique natural disasters;
•   longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries; and
•   import and export licensing requirements.
these risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. for example, as mentioned above, we are subject to compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. while our employees, distributors and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.
new technologies may be developed, validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services.
the scientific and research communities continue to explore methods to develop improved models and systems that would replace or supplement the use of living animals as test platforms in biomedical research as well as improve the translation of cellular and animal models to human studies and vice-versa. some companies have developed techniques in these areas that may have scientific merit. in addition, technological improvements to existing or new processes, such as imaging and other translational biomarker technologies, could result in the refinement and utility for the number of animal research models necessary to improve the translation from preclinical to human studies. there is an increasing push to focus on in vitro technologies such as human materials, stem cell technology and model creation technology. however, the increasing availability and utility of these in vitro models is partially offset by these technologies facilitating the creation of humanized, highly specialized and specific disease mimicking models we can produce.
it is our strategy to explore non-animal approaches to reduce the need for animal models as these new methods become validated. for example, chantest has a well-developed program to evaluate the cardiac properties of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. we may not be successful in commercializing these methods, and, furthermore, revenues from these new models and approaches if successfully developed may not offset reduced sales or profits from research models. in addition, alternative research methods could decrease the need for future research models, and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales. lastly, other companies or entities may develop research models with characteristics different than the ones that we produce, and which may be viewed as more desirable by some of our clients.
negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business.
the products and services which we provide our clients are essential to the drug discovery, development and manufacturing processes, and are almost universally mandated by law. notwithstanding, certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes. historically, our core research model activities with rats, mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention. however, research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention, including shareholder proposals, impacting the industry. this has included demonstrations near facilities operated by us and at our annual meetings, as well as shareholder proposals we received for some of our past annual meetings of shareholders. in some instances, periodic demonstrations at our operating sites occur. any negative attention, threats or acts of vandalism directed against either our animal research activities or our third party service providers in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently.
18
the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive.
the drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive. we often compete for business not only with other cros, but also with internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients, who may have greater resources than ours. we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for outsourced services. we compete on a variety of factors, including:
•   reputation for on-time quality performance;
•   reputation for regulatory compliance;
•   expertise and experience in multiple specialized areas;
•   scope and breadth of service and product offerings across the drug discovery and development spectrum;
•   ability to provide flexible and customized solutions to support our clients' drug discovery and development needs;
•   broad geographic availability (with consistent quality);
•   price/value;
•   technological expertise and efficient drug development processes;
•   quality of facilities;
•   financial stability;
•   size;
•   ability to acquire, process, analyze and report data in an accurate manner; and
•   accessibility of client data through secure portals.
if we do not compete successfully, our business will suffer. increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results. the drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation, particularly among the biotechnology companies, who are targets for each other and for larger pharmaceutical companies. if this trend continues, it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and cros generally, with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates. in addition, while there are substantial barriers to entry for large, global competitors with broad-based services, small, specialized entities considering entering the cro industry will continue to find lower barriers to entry, and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities to acquire and consolidate these companies, thus further increasing possible competition. more generally, our competitors or others might develop technologies, services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies, services or products, or that render our technologies, services or products less competitive or obsolete. if competitors introduce superior technologies, services or products and we cannot make enhancements to ours to remain competitive, our competitive position, and in turn our business, revenue and financial condition, would be materially and adversely affected. in the aggregate, these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our technologies, services or products and could adversely affect our financial results.
potential changes in u.s. and international tax law.
in the u.s., there are several proposals to reform corporate tax law that are currently under consideration. these proposals include reducing the corporate statutory tax rate, broadening the corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions, exclusions and credits, implementing a territorial regime of taxation, limiting the ability of u.s. corporations to deduct interest expense associated with offshore earnings, modifying the foreign tax credit rules, and reducing the ability to defer u.s. tax on offshore earnings. these or other changes in the u.s. tax laws could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability.
we have substantial operations in canada and the united kingdom which currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements.  we receive substantial tax credits in canada, from both the canadian federal and quebec governments, and the united kingdom.  any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits due to tax law changes or outcomes of tax controversies could have a material adverse effect on our profits, cash flow and effective tax rate.
currently, the oecd has developed an action plan to address concerns regarding base erosion and profit shifting (beps). this initiative has resulted in proposed and enacted changes to tax laws in various countries including france, germany, and the united kingdom. future changes to tax laws or interpretation of tax laws resulting from the beps project could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability.
contract research services create a risk of liability.
as a cro, we face a range of potential liabilities which may include:
19
•   errors or omissions in reporting of study detail in preclinical studies that may lead to inaccurate reports, which may undermine the usefulness of a study or data from the study, or which may potentially advance studies absent the necessary support or inhibit studies from proceeding to the next level of testing;
•   risks associated with our possible failure to properly care for our clients' property, such as research models and samples, study compounds, records, work in progress, other archived materials, or goods and materials in transit, while in our possession;
•   risks that models in our breeding facilities or in facilities that we manage may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to themselves or humans despite preventive measures contained in our policies for the quarantine and handling of imported animals; and
•   risks that we may have errors and omissions and/or product liabilities related to our products designed to conduct lot release testing of medical devices and injectable drugs (primarily through our emd business) or in the testing of biologics and other services performed by our biologics business, which could result in us or our clients failing to identify unsafe or contaminated materials.
while we attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods, it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks. in our rms business, we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing, quarantine procedures, and veterinary staff vigilance, through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections. in our dsa and manufacturing businesses, we attempt to reduce these risks by contractual risk transfer provisions entitling us to be indemnified subject to a limitation of liability, by insurance maintained by our clients and/or by us, and by various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business.
contractual risk transfer indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions, such as negligence or misconduct. we could be materially and adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is outside any contractual indemnification provision, or if a party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations, or the damage is beyond the scope or level of insurance coverage. we also often contractually indemnify our clients (subject to a limitation of liability), similar to the way they indemnify us, and we may be materially adversely affected if we have to fulfill our indemnity obligations. furthermore, there can be no assurance that we nor a party required to indemnify us will be able to maintain such insurance coverage (either at all or on terms acceptable to us).
upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions.
in recent years we implemented a project to replace many of our numerous legacy business systems at certain different sites worldwide with an enterprise wide, integrated enterprise resource planning (erp) system. the expansion of the system to other international locations may occur at a future date based on value to the business. in general, the process of planning and preparing for these types of integrated, wide-scale implementations is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges including data conversion, system cutover and user training. problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments, missed sales, billing and accounting errors and other operational issues. there have been numerous, well-publicized instances of companies experiencing difficulties with the implementation of erp systems which resulted in negative business consequences.
the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation, and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits.
the drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue. accordingly, we face potential patent infringement suits by companies that have patents for similar products and methods used in business or other suits alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could be expensive, take significant time and divert management's attention from other business concerns, whether we win or lose. if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us, we might have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages, and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms.
we may not be able to successfully develop and market new services and products.
we may seek to develop and market new services and products that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings. we believe our ability to in-license new technologies from third-parties will be critical to our ability to offer new products and services to our customers. our ability to gain access to technologies that we need for new products and services depends - in part - on our ability to convince inventors and their agents or assignees that we can successfully commercialize their inventions. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify new technologies of interest to our customers. even if we are able to identify new technologies of interest, we may not be able to negotiate license agreements on acceptable terms, or
20
at all. if we are unable to develop new services and products and/or create demand for those newly developed services and products, our future business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.
our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects.
at december 27, 2014, we had $753.8 million of debt. this debt could have significant adverse effects on our business, including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms; requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt; limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities; and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates. for additional information regarding our debt, please see note 7 included in the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10-k.
if we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire, or in managing our current and future divestitures, our business may suffer.
during the past fifteen years, we have steadily expanded our business through numerous acquisitions. we plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies and form strategic alliances. however, businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable. we risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners, but not completing transactions.
even if completed, acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include:
•   difficulties in achieving business and financial success;
•   difficulties and expenses incurred in assimilating and integrating operations, services, products technologies or pre-existing relationships with our customers, distributors and suppliers;
•   challenges with developing and operating new businesses, including those which are materially different from our existing businesses and which may require the development or acquisition of new internal capabilities and expertise;
•   potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies that are not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller;
•   loss of key employees;
•   the presence or absence of adequate internal controls and/or significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies;
•   diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;
•   acquisitions could be dilutive to earnings, or in the event of acquisitions made through the issuance of our common stock to the shareholders of the acquired company, dilutive to the percentage of ownership of our existing shareholders;
•   risks of not being able to overcome differences in foreign business practices, customs and importation regulations, language and other cultural barriers in connection with the acquisition of foreign companies;
•   new technologies and products may be developed which cause businesses or assets we acquire to become less valuable; and
•   risks that disagreements or disputes with prior owners of an acquired business, technology, service or product may result in litigation expenses and distribution of our management's attention.
in the event that an acquired business or technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations, our results of operations may be adversely affected.
some of the same risks exist when we decide to sell a business, site, or product line. in addition, divestitures could involve additional risks, including the following:
•   difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel; and
•   the need to agree to retain or assume certain current or future liabilities in order to complete the divestiture.
we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of our businesses. these and any divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner. we may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business, site or product line, and as a result, we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the divestiture.
we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel, which would harm our business.
21
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management. james c. foster, our chief executive officer since 1992 and chairman since 2000, has held various positions with us for almost four decades. we have no employment agreement with mr. foster or other members of our non-european based senior management. if mr. foster or other members of senior management do not continue in their present positions, our business may suffer.
because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. while we have a strong record of employee retention, there is still significant competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary, pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields. therefore, we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business. the loss of the services of existing personnel, as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner, could harm our business.
our quarterly operating results may vary, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.
our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as:
•   changes in the general global economy;
•   the number and scope of ongoing client engagements;
•   the commencement, postponement, delay, progress, completion or cancellation of client contracts in the quarter;
•   changes in the mix of our products and services;
•   competitive pricing pressures;
•   the extent of cost overruns;
•   holiday buying patterns of our clients;
•   budget cycles of our clients;
•   changes in tax laws, rules, regulations and tax rates in the locations in which we operate;
•   the timing and charges associated with completed acquisitions and other events;
•   the financial performance of the limited partnerships in which we invest;
•   the occasional extra "53rd week" that we recognize in a fiscal year (and 4th fiscal quarter thereof) due to our fiscal year ending on the last saturday in december; and
•   exchange rate fluctuations.
we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results. nonetheless, fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements. actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in "risk factors" and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. certain percentage changes from period over period may not recalculate due to rounding.
overview we are a full service, early-stage contract research organization (cro). for nearly 70 years, we have been in the business of providing the research models required in research and development of new drugs, devices, and therapies. over this time, we have built upon our original core competency laboratory animal medicine and science (research model technologies) to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services, both good laboratory practice (glp) and non-glp, that are able to support our clients from target identification through preclinical development. we also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients' manufacturing activities. utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more flexible drug development model, which reduces their costs, enhances their productivity and effectiveness, and increases speed to market.
our client base includes primarily of all of the major global pharmaceutical companies, many biotechnology companies, contract research organizations, agricultural and chemical companies, life science companies, veterinary medicine companies, contract manufacturing organizations, medical device companies, diagnostic and other commercial entities, as well as leading hospitals, academic institutions and government agencies around the world. we currently operate approximately 60 facilities in 17 countries worldwide, which numbers exclude our insourcing solutions (is) sites.
business trends the demand for our outsourced services increased in the fiscal year 2014, as did demand for products and services to support our clients' manufacturing activities. our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients continued to intensify their use of strategic outsourcing to improve their operating efficiency and access capabilities that they do not maintain internally. many of our large biopharmaceutical clients are beginning to refocus on their drug discovery and early-stage development efforts after, a period of stronger emphasis on delivering late-stage programs to bring new drugs to market. in addition, mid-tier biopharmaceutical clients benefited from a resurgence in the biotechnology funding environment in the fiscal year 2014, from both capital markets and partnering with large biopharmaceutical companies. academia has also benefited from partnering activities, as large biopharmaceutical companies have increasingly utilized academic research capabilities to broaden the scope of their research activities.
the primary result of these trends was improved demand for our discovery and safety assessment services in the fiscal year 2014, particularly from mid-tier clients. this improvement led to capacity continuing to fill in our safety assessment business, in which utilization is beginning to approach optimal levels. our targeted sales efforts also generated continued market shares gains. price remained competitive, but trends are stable to slightly improving. we believe our scientific expertise, quality, and responsiveness remain key criteria when our clients make the decision to outsource to us. in order to accommodate this increased demand and maintain responsiveness to clients' needs, we opened small amounts of new capacity in the fiscal year 2014 at existing facilities and continue to strategically evaluate further capacity additions.
our clients' intensified focus on the earliest stages of their pipelines has been visible in increasing demand for discovery services, and the willingness to outsource new areas of their research programs. to address these emerging needs and move further upstream in the drug research and development continuum, we acquired the early discovery businesses of argenta, biofocus, chantest, and vivopath in the fiscal year 2014, which has enabled us to work with clients at the earliest stage of the discovery process. our full service, early-stage portfolio has led to additional client discussions regarding strategic relationships in the fiscal year 2014, where clients seek to outsource larger portions of their early-stage drug research programs to us.
while demand for research models and certain services remained constrained in the fiscal year 2014 as clients' continued to consolidate infrastructure and seek greater pipeline productivity, we remain confident that the long-term drivers of our business as a whole will primarily emerge from our clients' demand for discovery and safety assessment services and research models and services, which remain essential to the early-stage drug research process, as well as our products and services that support our clients' manufacturing activities, including endotoxin and microbial detection.
28
acquisitions during the fiscal year 2014, we continued to make a number of strategic acquisitions designed to expand our portfolio of services to support the drug discovery and early-stage development continuum and position us as a market leader in the outsourced discovery services market. the 2014 acquisitions include:
•   in april 2014, we acquired 100% of the shares of the united kingdom (u.k.)-based entities argenta and biofocus, and certain related dutch assets, to form the core of our early discovery business. through this transaction, we enhanced our position as a full service, early-stage cro, with integrated in vitro and in vivo capabilities from target discovery through preclinical development. the preliminary purchase price of the acquisition was $183.1 million, net of cash acquired, and included contingent consideration.
•   in june 2014, we acquired substantially all of the assets of vivopath llc (vivopath), a discovery service company. the preliminary purchase price was $2.3 million, including contingent consideration that could become payable over the next three years based on the achievement of revenue growth targets.
•   in october 2014, we acquired chantest corporation (chantest), a leading provider of ion channel testing services to the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. the preliminary purchase price was $52.1 million, net of cash acquired, and included contingent consideration.
segment reporting in the second quarter of 2014, following our acquisition of argenta and biofocus, we revised our reportable segments to ensure alignment with our view of the business. we reviewed the new and existing markets addressed by the business, the recently revised go-to-market strategy, long-term operating margins, and the discrete financial information available to our chief operating decision maker, and considered how our businesses aggregated based on these qualitative and quantitative factors. based on this review, we identified three reportable segments: research models and services (rms), discovery and safety assessment (dsa), and manufacturing support (manufacturing). we reported segment results on this basis for the current period and retrospectively for all comparable prior periods.
the revised reportable segments are as follows:
research models and services   discovery and safety assessment   manufacturing support research models                discovery services (2)            endotoxin and microbial detection research model services (1)    safety assessment                 avian vaccine services biologics testing solutions
(1) research model services includes genetically engineered models and services (gems), research animal diagnostic services (rads), and is.
(2) discovery services includes both the early discovery and in vivo discovery businesses. early discovery includes argenta, biofocus, and chantest.
our rms segment includes the research models and research model services businesses. research models includes the commercial production and sale of small research models, as well as the supply of large research models. research model services includes three business units: gems, which performs contract breeding and other services associated with genetically engineered research models; rads, which provides health monitoring and diagnostics services related to research models; and is, which provides management of our clients' research operations (including recruitment, training, staffing and management services). our dsa segment includes services required to take a drug through the early development process including discovery services, which are non-regulated services to assist clients with the identification, screening, and selection of a lead compound for drug development, and regulated and non-regulated safety assessment services. our manufacturing segment includes endotoxin and microbial detection (emd), which includes in vitro (non-animal) lot-release testing products and microbial detection and species identification services; biologics testing services (biologics), which performs specialized testing of biologics and devices; and avian vaccine services (avian), which supplies specific-pathogen-free fertile chicken eggs and chickens.
prior to recasting the reportable segments, the businesses were reported in two segments as follows:
research models and services        preclinical services research models (3)                 discovery services research model services (4)         safety assessment endotoxin and microbial detection   biologics testing solutions
29
(3) research models included avian vaccine services.
(4) research model services included gems, rads, is and discovery research services. as part of the segment revisions, the former discovery research services was been folded into our discovery services business, previously located under the preclinical services segment.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states (u.s.). the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods and related disclosures. these estimates and assumptions are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. we base our estimates on our historical experience, trends in the industry, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe that our application of the following accounting policies, each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1, "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies", to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been provided, our price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
service revenue is generally evidenced by client contracts, which range in duration from a few weeks to a few years and typically take the form of an agreed upon rate per unit or fixed fee arrangements. such contracts typically do not contain acceptance provisions based upon the achievement of certain study or laboratory testing results. revenue of agreed upon rate per unit contracts is recognized as services are performed, based upon rates specified in the contract. in cases where performance spans reporting periods, revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed, measured on the ratio of outputs or performance obligations completed to the total contractual outputs or performance obligations to be provided. changes in estimated effort to complete the fixed fee contract are reflected in the period in which the change becomes known. changes in scope of work are common, especially under long-term contracts, and generally result in a change in contract value. once the parties have agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms, the contract value is amended and revenue is typically recognized as described above.
most contracts are terminable by the client, either immediately or upon notice. these contracts often require payment to us of expenses to wind down the project, fees earned to date or, in some cases, a termination fee. such payments are included in revenues when earned.
we recognize product revenue, net of allowances for estimated returns, rebates and discounts, when title and risk of loss pass to customers. when we sell equipment with specified acceptance criteria, we assess our ability to meet the acceptance criteria in order to determine the timing of revenue recognition. we would defer revenue until completion of customer acceptance testing if we are not able to demonstrate the ability to meet such acceptance criteria.
income taxes we prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction's tax laws and regulations. in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. in performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. in making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and the effects of tax planning strategies. our estimates of future taxable income include,
30
among other items, our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options. in the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
we account for uncertain tax positions using a "more-likely-than-not" threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors, that include, but are not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the "more-likely-than-not" threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process. we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews; we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position; and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would re-examine the related tax position. we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
as of december 27, 2014, our non-u.s. subsidiaries' undistributed foreign earnings included in consolidated retained earnings aggregated $271.0 million. all undistributed foreign earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries, exclusive of earnings that would result in little or no net income tax expense or which were previously taxed under current u.s. tax law, are reinvested indefinitely in operations outside the u.s. this determination is made on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis and takes into account the liquidity requirements in both the u.s. and within our foreign subsidiaries. if we decide to repatriate funds in the future to execute our growth initiatives or to fund any other liquidity needs, the resulting tax consequences would negatively impact our results of operations through a higher effective tax rate and dilution of our earnings.
goodwill and intangible assets we use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. the determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques, such as the income approach and the cost approach, as appropriate, in establishing the fair value of intangible assets. typically, key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets.
we review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.
we evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. if we elect this option and believe, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable, the quantitative two-step impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. alternatively, we may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and immediately perform the quantitative two-step impairment test. in the first step, we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. if the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units, then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill. if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.
31
in the fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, we performed the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test for our reporting units. fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of a market-based approach and an income approach, as this combination was deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. under the market-based approach, we utilized information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units. under the income approach, we determined fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.
our 2014, 2013 and 2012 impairment test indicated that goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired.
in 2014, we revised our reportable segments to align with our new view of the business following the argenta and biofocus acquisition. as a result of this reorganization, goodwill was allocated from our prior reportable segments to our new reportable segments based on the fair value of each business group within its original reporting unit relative to the fair value of that reporting unit. in addition, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed.
valuation and impairment of long-lived assets long-lived assets to be held and used, including property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following:
•   significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;
•   significant negative industry or economic trends; or
•   significant changes or developments in strategy or operations that negatively affect the utilization of our long-lived assets.
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset, net of any sublease income, if applicable, and its eventual disposition. in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to their fair values. we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows, including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets, as appropriate. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets. during the fiscal year 2014, we did not record any significant impairment charges to long-lived assets.
pension and other retiree benefit plans several of our u.s. and non-u.s. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. this amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. we measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year end.
the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the expected return on plan assets, discount rate, and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. assumptions are determined based on our data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation.
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance.
the discount rate reflects the rate we would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle our current pension obligations. in the fiscal year 2014, as part of our annual review of assumptions for our u.s. pension and retiree benefit plans, we selected the discount rate based on a cash-flow matching analysis using towers watson's proprietary bond:link tool.  prior to the fiscal year 2014, we employed a cash-flow matching methodology, which
32
used the spot yield curve underlying the citigroup index. the refined estimation technique permits us to more closely match cash flows to the expected payments to participants than would be possible with the previously used yield curve model. we believe such a refinement results in an estimate of the discount rate that more accurately reflects the settlement value for plan obligations than the yield curve methodology used in prior years, as it provides the ability to review the quality and diversification of the portfolio to select the bond issues that would settle the obligation in an optimal manner. this refinement reduced our benefit obligations as of december 27, 2014 by $5.5 million.
the rate of compensation increase reflects the expected annual salary increases for the plan participants based on historical experience and the current employee compensation strategy.
in the fiscal year 2014, for our u.s. plans, we adopted new mortality tables (rp-2014) and a new mortality improvement scale (mp-2014), which increased our benefit obligations by $6.0 million as of december 27, 2014. we previously used the rp-2000 mortality tables with mortality improvements projected using scale aa to 2021 for annuitants and to 2029 for non-annuitants. in addition, for our u.k. plans, the mortality table was updated to s2 series (saps) using the cmi 2013 core projection with a 1.25% per annum long-term mortality improvement. this update increased our benefit obligations by $1.9 million as of december 27, 2014. prior to the fiscal year 2014, we used the s1 series (saps) mortality table and the cmi 2009 core projection with a 1.25% per annum long-term improvement. the new mortality information reflects improved life expectancies and an expectation that the trend will continue.
stock-based compensation we grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance share units (psus) to employees, and stock options and restricted stock to non-employee directors under stock-based compensation plans. we make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our stock-based compensation arrangements. changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the timing and amount of expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.
determining the appropriate valuation model and related assumptions requires judgment. the fair value of stock options granted is calculated using the black-scholes model and the fair value of psus is calculated using a lattice model with a monte carlo simulation, both of which require the use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term, among others.
determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of psu's performance targets requires judgment, including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets. the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets. the cumulative impact of any changes to our estimates is reflected in the period of change.
we also estimate forfeitures over the requisite service period when recognizing share-based compensation expense based on historical rates and forward looking factors; these estimates are adjusted to the extent that actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to materially differ, from our estimates.

the increase in rms sg&a of $6.2 million was related to an increase of $2.5 million in compensation, benefits and other employee related expenses; the recording of $1.6 million in charges related to an arbitration award in favor of a large model supplier; an increase of $0.5 million in severance due to consolidation plans in the u.s. and japan; and an increase of $2.6 million in other expenses; partially offset by a decrease of $1.0 million due to a gain on the sale of facility impacted by a consolidation plan. rms sg&a as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2014 was 13.0%, an increase of 1.3%, from 11.7% for the fiscal year 2013.
the increase in dsa sg&a of $13.4 million was related to an increase of $5.5 million in compensation, benefits and other employee related expenses; an increase of $1.9 million in severance; an increase of $1.2 million in operating expenses including information technology infrastructure and facility expenses; an increase of $0.8 million in stock-based compensation, primarily related to our new hire grants and our annual stock-based grants made in february 2014; and an increase of $4.0 million in other expenses; all of which were primarily due to the argenta and biofocus acquisition. dsa sg&a as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2014 was 11.7%, an increase of 0.2%, from 11.5% for the fiscal year 2013.
the increase in manufacturing sg&a of $5.6 million was related to an increase of $3.8 million in compensation, benefits and other employee related expenses; an increase of $1.8 million in operating expenses including information technology infrastructure and facility expenses; and an increase of $0.5 million in stock-based compensation, primarily related to our new hire grants and our annual stock-based grants made in february 2014; partially offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in other expenses. manufacturing sg&a as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2014 was 18.9%, consistent with the fiscal year 2013.
the increase in unallocated corporate sg&a of $18.1 million was related to an increase of $7.4 million in compensation, benefits and other employee related expenses; an increase of $5.1 million of stock-based compensation, primarily related to our new hire grants, our annual stock-based grants made in february 2014 and increased expense recognized for performance stock units whose payout is based upon our financial performance; an increase of $4.8 million in external consulting and other service expenses; an increase of $4.5 million of costs associated with the evaluation and integration of acquisitions; and an increase of $1.4 million in other expenses; partially offset by a reduction of $5.1 million in information technology related expenses.
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangibles for the fiscal year 2014 was $26.0 million, an increase of $8.2 million, or 46.1%, from $17.8 million for the fiscal year 2013, primarily as a result of the argenta and biofocus acquisition.
interest income interest income, which represents earnings on held cash, cash equivalents, and time deposits, was $1.2 million for the fiscal year 2014, an increase of $0.5 million, or 71.4%, compared to $0.7 million for the fiscal year 2013.
interest expense interest expense for the fiscal year 2014 was $12.0 million, a decrease of $9.0 million, or 42.9%, compared to $21.0 million for the fiscal year 2013. the decrease was primarily the result of the retirement late in the second quarter of the fiscal year 2013 of our senior convertible debentures, which lowered our effective interest rate.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net was $10.7 million for the fiscal year 2014, an increase of $3.5 million, or 48.6%, compared to $7.2 million for the fiscal year 2013. the increase in other income (expense), net was driven by our investments in limited partnerships accounted for under the equity method, which increased $3.4 million, and a non-cash

gain of $2.1 million related to assets assumed at our frederick, maryland facility following the termination of a customer contract, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange and other activity of $2.0 million.
income taxes income tax expense in the fiscal year 2014 increased $14.8 million, compared with the fiscal year 2013. our effective tax rate was 26.8% in the fiscal year 2014, compared to 23.8% in the fiscal year 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to current-year tax law changes, including a statutory 25% decrease in the canadian scientific research and experimental development (sr&ed) credit and an increase in the limitation of deductibility of interest expense in france. in addition, the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2014 reflected a discrete tax cost of $1.6 million related to the nondeductible transaction costs incurred in the fiscal year 2014 for the acquisition of the early discovery businesses and a discrete tax cost of $1.2 million related to the write-off of deferred tax assets as a result of the reorganization of the company's rms u.k. entities. these increases were partially offset by a $2.1 million release of an uncertain tax position resulting from an ability to offset tax on a capital gain from an investment in a limited partnership. the fiscal year 2013 effective tax rate includes a discrete tax detriment of $2.0 million related to the ongoing transfer pricing controversy with the canadian revenue authority (cra).

(1)   notes payable includes the principal payments on our debt.
(2)   we lease properties and equipment for use in our operations. in addition to rent, the leases may require us to pay additional amounts for taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses. amounts reflected within the table, detail future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable operating leases for each of the periods presented.
(3)   in the fiscal year 2014, we acquired a build-to-suit lease as part of our acquisition of argenta and biofocus. in accordance with accounting guidance applicable to entities involved with the construction of an asset that will be leased when the construction is completed, we are considered the owner of this property during the construction period. accordingly, we recorded an asset and a corresponding financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet for the amount of costs incurred related to the construction for this building. the construction is expected to be completed in the first half of the fiscal year 2015. upon completion of the building, we will assess and determine if the assets and corresponding liability should be derecognized. as of december 27, 2014, the amount recorded within our consolidated balance sheet as property, plant and equipment and financing obligation totaled $23.1 million. the amounts in the above table represent future minimum rental commitments.
(4)   we maintain defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans as discussed in note 10, "employee benefit plans" included in this report. in the above table we have included the discounted estimated benefit payments we
40
expect to make to fund our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. we note that actual payments to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors that may change in future years; such as expected retirement age, rate of compensation increases, medical trend rates, mortality assumptions, etc.  our funding for pension plans is consistent with applicable laws and regulations.
(5)   the estimated cash obligation for redeemable noncontrolling interest, which is exercisable by the non-controlling interest holders in 2016 at fair value, is based on the estimated fair value of the interest as of december 27, 2014.
(6)   the timing of the remaining capital commitment payments to limited partnership investments is subject to the procedures of the general partner and is therefore estimated by management.
(7)   in connection with our purchase of argenta and biofocus, vivopath and chantest, we agreed to make additional payments of up to $10.5 million based upon the achievement of certain financial targets. the contingent consideration obligation included in the table above has not been probability adjusted or discounted.
tax related obligations we excluded liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations presented above as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. as of december 27, 2014, we have $34.6 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements, including "off-balance sheet arrangements" as described in sec regulation s-k item 303. as such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.

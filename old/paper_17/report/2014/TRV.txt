item 1a.    risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.
catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance.    our property and casualty insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares. catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks and other intentionally destructive acts (including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events), explosions and infrastructure failures. the geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposures in the united states and canada, which include, but are not limited to: hurricanes from maine through texas; tornadoes throughout the central, mid-atlantic and southeastern regions of the united states; earthquakes in california, the new madrid region and the pacific northwest region of north america; wildfires, particularly in western states and canada; and terrorism in major cities in the united states. in addition to our operations in the united states and canada, our international operations subject us to catastrophe exposures in the united kingdom and the republic of ireland, as well as to a variety of world-wide catastrophe exposures through our lloyd's operations, and in brazil through our joint venture investment.
the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable, and it is possible that both the frequency and severity of natural and man-made catastrophic events could increase. severe weather events over the last decade have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends, and potentially changing climate conditions could add to the frequency and severity of natural disasters and create additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. for example, over the last decade, hurricane activity has impacted areas further inland than previously experienced by us, thus expanding our potential for losses from hurricanes. additionally, both the frequency and severity of tornado and hail storms in the united states have been more volatile in recent years. moreover, we could experience more than one highly severe catastrophic event in any given period.
all of the catastrophe modeling tools that we use, or that we rely on from outside parties, to evaluate certain of our catastrophe exposures are based on assumptions and judgments that are subject to error and mis-estimation and may produce estimates that are materially different than actual results. in addition, compared to models for hurricanes, models for earthquakes are less reliable due to there being a more limited number of significant historical events to analyze, while models for tornadoes and hail storms are newer and may be even less reliable due to the highly random geographic nature and size of these events. as a result, models for earthquakes and tornado and hail storms may have even greater difficulty predicting risks and estimating losses. further, changes in climate conditions could cause our underlying modeling data to be less predictive, thus limiting our ability to effectively evaluate and manage catastrophe risk. see "we may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results" below as well as "item 7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscatastrophe modeling" and "changing climate conditions."
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future. for example, the specific geographic location impacted by tornadoes is inherently random and unpredictable and the specific location impacted by a tornado may or may not be highly populated and may or may not have a high concentration of our insured exposures.
51
states have from time to time passed legislation, and regulators have taken action, that have the effect of limiting the ability of insurers to manage catastrophe risk, such as legislation prohibiting insurers from reducing exposures or withdrawing from catastrophe-prone areas or mandating that insurers participate in residual markets. participation in residual market mechanisms has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant losses or assessments to insurers, including us, and, in certain states, those losses or assessments may not be commensurate with our direct catastrophe exposure in those states. if our competitors leave those states having residual market mechanisms, remaining insurers, including us, may be subject to significant increases in losses or assessments following a catastrophe. in addition, following catastrophes, there are sometimes legislative and administrative initiatives and court decisions that seek to expand insurance coverage for catastrophe claims beyond the original intent of the policies or seek to prevent the application of deductibles. also, our ability to adjust terms, including deductible levels, or to increase pricing to the extent necessary to offset rising costs of catastrophes, particularly in the personal insurance segment, requires approval of regulatory authorities of certain states. our ability or our willingness to manage our catastrophe exposure by raising prices, modifying underwriting terms or reducing exposure to certain geographies may be limited due to considerations of public policy, the evolving political environment and/or changes in the general economic climate. we also may choose to write business in catastrophe-prone areas that we might not otherwise write for strategic purposes, such as improving our access to other underwriting opportunities.
there are also factors that impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. for example, the estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves related to hurricanes can be affected by the inability to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; the impact of demand surge; infrastructure disruption; fraud; the effect of mold damage; business interruption costs; and reinsurance collectability. in recent years, increased late reporting of weather-related losses by claimants, particularly losses from hail damage, has led to higher costs than we previously expected. the timing of a catastrophe's occurrence, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to us in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves for that reporting period. the estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted in subsequent periods as actual claims emerge and additional information becomes available.
exposure to catastrophe losses or actual losses resulting from a catastrophe could adversely affect our financial strength and claims-paying ratings and could impair our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms or at all. also, as a result of our exposure to catastrophe losses or actual losses following a catastrophe, rating agencies may further increase capital requirements, which may require us to raise capital to maintain our ratings. a ratings downgrade could hurt our ability to compete effectively or attract new business. in addition, catastrophic events could cause us to exhaust our available reinsurance limits and could adversely impact the cost and availability of reinsurance. such events can also impact the credit of our reinsurers. for a discussion of our catastrophe reinsurance coverage, see "item 1businessreinsurancecatastrophe reinsurance." catastrophic events could also adversely impact the credit of the issuers of securities, such as states or municipalities, in whom we have invested.
in addition, coverage in our reinsurance program for terrorism is limited. although the terrorism risk insurance program provides benefits in the event of certain acts of terrorism, those benefits are subject to a deductible and other limitations. the program expired at the end of 2014 but was reauthorized, with some adjustments to its provisions, in january 2015 for six years through december 31, 2020. under current provisions of this program, once our losses exceed 20% of our
52
commercial property and casualty insurance premium for the preceding calendar year, the federal government will reimburse us for 85% of our losses attributable to certain acts of terrorism which exceed this deductible up to a total industry program cap of $100 billion. our estimated deductible under the program is $2.38 billion for 2015. over the six-year life of the reauthorized program, the federal government reimbursement percentage will fall from 85% to 80%. in addition, because the interpretation of this law is untested, there is substantial uncertainty as to how it will be applied to specific circumstances. it is also possible that future legislation could change or eliminate the program, which could adversely affect our business by increasing our exposure to terrorism losses, or by lowering our business volume through efforts to avoid that exposure.
because of the risks set forth above, catastrophes such as those caused by various natural events or man-made events such as a terrorist attack, including "unconventional" acts of terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity. further, we may not have sufficient resources to respond to claims arising from a high frequency of high severity natural catastrophes and/or of man-made catastrophic events involving conventional means. in addition, while we seek to manage our exposure to man-made catastrophic events involving conventional means, we may not have sufficient resources to respond to claims arising out of one or more man-made catastrophic events involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological means.
during or following a period of financial market disruption or economic downturn, our business could be materially and adversely affected.    worldwide financial markets have, from time to time, experienced significant disruption. for example, during the financial crisis that started approximately seven years ago, the united states and many other economies experienced a prolonged economic downturn, resulting in heightened credit risk, reduced valuation of certain investments and decreased economic activity. financial markets may again experience significant and prolonged disruption, including as a result of unanticipated events. in recent years, the federal government, particularly the federal reserve, has taken extraordinary steps to stabilize financial markets, encourage economic growth and keep interest rates low. during this time, the united states has experienced a slow rate of economic growth. even if economic growth continues in the united states, or other regions in which we do business, it may be at a slow or slower rate for an extended period of time. while inflation has recently been limited and that trend may continue, it is possible that the steps taken by the federal government to stabilize financial markets and improve economic conditions could lead to an inflationary environment. further, such steps may be ineffective and, in the case of the federal reserve, actual or anticipated efforts to continue to unwind some of such steps could disrupt financial markets and/or could adversely impact the value of our investment portfolio or general economic conditions.
financial market disruption or economic downturns could be exacerbated by actual or potential economic and geopolitical instability in many regions of the world. this can impact our business even if we do not conduct business in the region subject to the instability. for example, due to globalization, instability in one region can spread to other regions where we do business. in europe, uncertainty in recent years has included the increased potential for default by one or more european sovereign debt issuers, the potential partial or complete dissolution of the eurozone and its common currency and the negative impact of such potential events on global financial institutions and capital markets generally. actions or inactions of european governments may impact these actual or perceived risks. in the united states, future actions or inactions of the united states government can also impact economic conditions. for example, issues related to the u.s. federal budget and taxes, implementation of the affordable care act and the regulatory environment have added to the uncertainty regarding economic conditions generally.
if economic conditions deteriorate, or if financial markets experience significant disruption, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity. several of
53
the risk factors discussed below identify risks that result from, or are exacerbated by, an economic slowdown or financial disruption. these include risks discussed below related to our investment portfolio, reinsurance arrangements, other credit exposures, our estimates of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, emerging claim and coverage issues, the competitive environment, regulatory developments and the impact of rating agency actions. you should also refer to "item 7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," particularly the "outlook" section.
many of these risks could materialize, and our financial results could be negatively impacted, even after the end of an economic downturn or financial disruption. during or following an economic downturn, lower levels of economic activity could reduce (and historically have reduced) exposure changes at renewal. they also could adversely impact (and historically have adversely impacted) audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations after policies are written, particularly in our business units within business and international insurance, which could adversely impact our written premiums. an inflationary environment (which may follow government efforts to stabilize the economy) may also, as we discuss below, adversely impact our loss costs and could adversely impact the valuation of our investment portfolio. finally, as a result of financial market disruption, we may, as discussed below, face increased regulation.
if actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.    claims and claim adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent management estimates of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, generally utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques, at a given accounting date.
the process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. these variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as: changes in claims handling procedures; adverse changes in loss cost trends, including inflationary pressures on medical costs and auto and home repair costs; economic conditions including general inflation; legal trends and legislative changes; and varying judgments and viewpoints of the individuals involved in the estimation process, among others. the impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer).
as discussed above, it is possible that steps taken by the federal government to stabilize the economy could lead to higher inflation than we had anticipated, which could in turn lead to an increase in our loss costs. the impact of inflation on loss costs could be more pronounced for those lines of business that are considered "long tail," such as general liability, as they require a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year. in addition, a significant portion of claims costs, including those in "long tail" lines of business, consists of medical costs. healthcare reform legislation and its implementation may significantly impact the availability, cost and allocation of payments for medical services, and it is possible that, as a result, inflationary pressures in medical costs may increase or claim frequency and/or severity may otherwise be adversely impacted. the estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may also be more difficult during times of adverse or uncertain economic conditions due to unexpected changes in behavior of claimants and policyholders, including an increase in fraudulent reporting of exposures and/or losses, reduced maintenance of insured properties or increased frequency of small claims or delays in the reporting of claims.
54
we continually refine our claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves. business judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. different experts may choose different assumptions when faced with material uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional experiences and areas of focus. hence, such experts may at times produce estimates materially different from each other. this risk may be exacerbated in the context of an acquisition. experts providing input to the various estimates and underlying assumptions include actuaries, underwriters, claim personnel and lawyers, as well as other members of management. therefore, management may have to consider varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
we attempt to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are established or reviewed. due to the inherent uncertainty underlying claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates, the final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses will likely be higher or lower than the related claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. therefore, actual paid losses in the future may yield a materially different amount than is currently reserved.
because of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities resulting from one insured event, or an accumulation of insured events, may exceed the current related reserves. in addition, our estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and/or our financial position.
for a discussion of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by product line, including examples of common factors that can affect required reserves, see "item 7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting estimatesclaims and claim adjustment expense reserves."
our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses.    investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability. fixed maturity and short-term investments comprised approximately 93% of the carrying value of our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2014. changes in interest rates caused by inflation or other factors (inclusive of credit spreads) affect the carrying value of our fixed maturity investments and returns on our fixed maturity and short-term investments. a decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on short-term investments and new fixed maturity investments (including those purchased to re-invest maturities from the existing portfolio), thereby negatively impacting our net investment income, while rising interest rates reduce the market value of existing fixed maturity investments, thereby negatively impacting our book value. during 2014, the net unrealized gain in our fixed income portfolio increased from $1.76 billion to $2.67 billion as interest rates decreased. it is possible that future increases in interest rates (inclusive of credit spreads) could result in a decline in that unrealized gain position or even result in an unrealized loss, thereby adversely impacting our book value. interest rates in recent years have been and remain at very low levels relative to historical experience, and it is possible that rates may remain at low levels for a prolonged period. the value of our fixed maturity and short-term investments is also subject to the risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to a deterioration in the financial condition of one or more issuers of the securities held in our portfolio, or due to a deterioration in the financial condition of an insurer that guarantees an issuer's payments of such investments. such defaults and impairments could reduce our net investment income and result in realized investment losses. during an economic downturn, fixed maturity and short-term investments could be subject to a higher risk of default. rapid changes in commodity prices, such as a significant decline in oil and gas prices, could also subject certain of our investments to a higher risk of default.
55
our fixed maturity investment portfolio is invested, in substantial part, in obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio). notwithstanding the relatively low historical rates of default on many of these obligations and notwithstanding that we typically seek to invest in high-credit-quality securities (including those with structural protections such as being secured by dedicated or pledged sources of revenue), our municipal bond portfolio could be subject to default or impairment. in particular:
 the prolonged economic downturn that began in 2008, and the limited economic recovery that has followed, has resulted in many states and local governments operating under deficits or projected deficits. the severity and duration of these deficits could have an adverse impact on the collectability and valuation of our municipal bond portfolio. these deficits may be exacerbated by the impact of unfunded pension plan obligations and other postretirement obligations or by declining municipal tax bases and revenues in times of financial stress.
 some issuers may be unwilling to increase tax rates, or to reduce spending, to fund interest or principal payments on their municipal bonds, or may be unable to access the municipal bond market to fund such payments. the risk of widespread defaults may increase if some issuers voluntarily choose to default, instead of implementing difficult fiscal measures, and the actual or perceived consequences (such as reduced access to capital markets) are less severe than expected.
 the risk of widespread defaults may also increase if there are changes in legislation that permit states, municipalities and political subdivisions to file for bankruptcy protection where they were not permitted before. in addition, the collectability and valuation of municipal bonds may be adversely affected if there are judicial interpretations in a bankruptcy or other proceeding that lessen the value of structural protections. for example, debtors may challenge the effectiveness of structural protections thought to be provided by municipal securities backed by a dedicated source of revenue. the collectability and valuation may also be adversely affected if there are judicial interpretations in a bankruptcy or other proceeding that question the payment priority of municipal bonds.
a substantial portion of our fixed maturity portfolio will mature within the next few years. approximately 40% of the fixed maturity portfolio is expected to mature over the next three years (this includes the early redemption of bonds, assuming interest rates (including credit spreads) do not rise significantly by applicable call dates). for a schedule of the contractual maturities of our fixed maturity portfolio by year for the next several years, see "item 7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsinvestment portfolio." of that maturing portfolio, a substantial amount includes municipal bonds that have been pre-refunded with u.s. treasury securities. as a result, even if our investment strategy does not significantly change over the next few years, the overall yield on and composition of our portfolio could be meaningfully impacted by the types of investments available for reinvestment with the proceeds of matured bonds. for example, if yields remain low when we reinvest such proceeds, our future net investment income would be adversely affected. in addition, depending on the specific bonds available for purchase at the time of re-investment, the mix of specific issuers in our fixed-income and municipal bond portfolio will change.
our portfolio has benefited from tax exemptions and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits (such as foreign tax credits). changes in these laws could adversely impact the value of our investment portfolio. see "changes in u.s. tax laws or in the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact us" below.
our investment portfolio includes: residential mortgage-backed securities; collateralized mortgage obligations; pass-through securities and asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages; commercial mortgage-backed securities; and wholly-owned real estate and real estate partnerships, all
56
of which could be adversely impacted by declines in real estate valuations and/or financial market disruption.
we also invest a portion of our assets in equity securities, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships. from time to time, we may also invest in other types of non-fixed maturity investments, including investments with exposure to commodity price risk, such as in the energy sector. all of these asset classes are subject to greater volatility in their investment returns than fixed maturity investments. general economic conditions, changes in applicable tax laws and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our non-fixed maturity investments and the realization of net investment income, and/or result in realized investment losses. as a result of these factors, we may realize reduced returns on these investments, incur losses on sales of these investments and be required to write down the value of these investments, which could reduce our net investment income and result in realized investment losses. from time to time, the company enters into short positions in u.s. treasury futures contracts to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio, which can result in realized investment losses.
our investment portfolio is also subject to increased valuation uncertainties when investment markets are illiquid. the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are illiquid, thereby increasing the risk that the estimated fair value (i.e., the carrying amount) of the portion of the investment portfolio that is carried at fair value as reflected in our financial statements is not reflective of prices at which actual transactions could occur.
given that economic and market conditions have been and could be highly uncertain, we may, depending on circumstances in the future, make changes to the mix of investments in our investment portfolio. these changes may impact the duration, volatility and risk of our investment portfolio.
because of the risks set forth above, the value of our investment portfolio could decrease, we could experience reduced net investment income and we could experience realized and/or unrealized investment losses, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.
our business could be harmed because of our potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation.
with regard to asbestos claims, we have received and continue to receive a significant number of asbestos claims from policyholders (including others seeking coverage under a policy). factors underlying these claim filings include continued intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the continued focus by plaintiffs on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation. the focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years. the bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but remain in the tort system. currently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. this trend of prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation, has contributed to the claims and claim adjustment expense payments we experienced.
we also continue to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders, some of whom have filed for bankruptcy, who in some instances have asserted that all or a portion of their asbestos-related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. in these instances, policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated as a separate occurrence under the policy. it is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues.
57
to the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder's favor and our other defenses are not successful, our coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per-occurrence limits and the number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders. although we have seen a moderation in the overall risk associated with these lawsuits, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims.
further, in addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including us, by individuals challenging insurers' conduct with respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. it is possible that the filing of other direct actions against insurers, including us, could be made in the future. it is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability.
with regard to environmental claims, we have received and continue to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances. mostly, these claims arise under various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. for instance, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. this federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. liability under cercla and similar state laws may be imposed on certain parties even if they did not cause the release or threatened release of hazardous substances and may be joint and several with other responsible parties.
the company has been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. the company believes that some court decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. these decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these asbestos and environmental claims continue, and it is difficult to estimate our ultimate liability for such claims and related litigation. as a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. the continuing uncertainties include, without limitation:
 the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation;
 any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants;
 a further increase in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated;
 the emergence of a greater number of asbestos claims than anticipated as a result of extended life expectancies resulting from medical advances and lifestyle improvements;
 the role of any umbrella or excess policies we have issued;
 the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with our previous assessment of these claims;
 the number and outcome of direct actions against us;
 future developments pertaining to our ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims;
58
 the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers; and
 uncertainties arising from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders and other defendants.
it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. this environment could be affected by changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims. it is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. this is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective.
while the ongoing evaluation of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs' expanded theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current reserves by an amount that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. see the "asbestos claims and litigation" and "environmental claims and litigation" sections of "item 7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." also see "item 3legal proceedings."
we are exposed to, and may face adverse developments involving, mass tort claims such as those relating to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances.    in addition to asbestos and environmental claims, we face exposure to other types of mass tort claims, including claims related to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances, including lead paint, silica and welding rod fumes. establishing claims and claim adjustment expense reserves for mass tort claims is subject to uncertainties because of many factors, including expanded theories of liability, disputes concerning medical causation with respect to certain diseases, geographical concentration of the lawsuits asserting the claims and the potential for a large rise in the total number of claims without underlying epidemiological developments suggesting an increase in disease rates. moreover, evolving judicial interpretations regarding the application of various tort theories and defenses, including application of various theories of joint and several liabilities, as well as the application of insurance coverage to these claims, make it difficult to estimate our ultimate liability for such claims.
because of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves. in addition, our estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change, and such change could be material. these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.    as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge. these issues may adversely affect our business, including by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent, by increasing the number, size or types of claims or by mandating changes to our underwriting practices. examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include, but are not limited to:
 judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new or expanded theories of liability;
 plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers, including us, in purported class action litigation relating to claims-handling and other practices;
59
 claims relating to construction defects, which often present complex coverage and damage valuation questions;
 claims under directors' & officers' insurance policies relating to losses from involvement in financial market activities, such as mortgage or financial product origination, distribution, structuring or servicing and foreclosure procedures; failed financial institutions; fraud; possible accounting irregularities; and corporate governance issues;
 claims related to data and network security breaches, information system failures or cyber attacks;
 the assertion of "public nuisance" or similar theories of liability, pursuant to which plaintiffs seek to recover monies spent to administer public health care programs, abate hazards to public health and safety and/or recover damages purportedly attributable to a "public nuisance";
 claims related to liability or workers' compensation arising out of the spread of infectious disease or pandemic;
 claims relating to molestation by an employee or a volunteer of an insured;
 claims that link health issues to particular causes (for example, cumulative traumatic head injury from sports or other causes), resulting in liability or workers' compensation claims;
 claims alleging that one or more of our underwriting criteria have a disparate impact on persons belonging to a protected class in violation of the law, including the fair housing act;
 claims arising out of techniques to expand access to oil and gas resources, such as hydraulic fracturing;
 claims arising out of the use of personal cars, homes or other property in commercial transactions, such as ride or home sharing;
 claims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies or business processes; and
 claims relating to potentially changing climate conditions, including higher frequency and severity of weather-related events.
in some instances, these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies. as a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known for many years after the policies are issued.
in addition, the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue, to remove limitations on recovery, to deem by statute the existence of a covered occurrence, to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business.
the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
the intense competition that we face could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability.    the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive, and we believe that it will remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. we compete with both domestic and foreign insurers which may offer products at prices and on terms that are not consistent with our economic standards in an effort to maintain or increase their business. the competitive environment in which we operate could also be impacted by current general economic conditions, which could reduce the volume of business available to us as well as to our competitors. in recent years, pension and hedge funds and other entities with substantial available capital have increasingly
60
sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses. well-capitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries, or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital, may conduct business in ways that adversely impact our business volumes and profitability. further, an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely significantly on reinsurance and, as a consequence, those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively. in addition, the competitive environment could be impacted by changes in customer preferences, including customer demand for direct distribution channels, not only in personal lines (where we currently and may increasingly compete against direct writers), but also in commercial lines (where direct writers may become a more significant source of competition in the future, particularly in the small commercial market).
in personal insurance, the use of comparative rating technologies has impacted, and may continue to impact, our business as well as the industry as a whole. a substantial amount of the company's personal insurance new business is written after an agent compares quotes using comparative rating technologies, a cost-efficient means of obtaining quotes from multiple companies. because the use of this technology, whether by agents or directly by customers, facilitates the process of generating multiple quotes, the technology has increased price comparison on new business and, increasingly, on renewal business. it also has resulted in an increase in the level of quote activity and a lower percentage of quotes that result in new business from customers, and these trends may continue or accelerate. if we are not able to operate with a competitive cost structure or accurately estimate and price for claims and claim adjustment expenses, our underwriting margins could be adversely affected over time. additionally, similar technology is starting to be used to access comparative rates for small commercial business and that trend may continue or accelerate. agents, brokers, significant technology companies or other third parties may also create alternate distribution channels for personal or commercial business, such as insurance exchanges, that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing.
other technological changes may present competitive risks. for example, innovations, such as telematics and other usage-based methods of determining premiums, can impact product design and pricing and may become an increasingly important competitive factor. other potential technological changes, such as driverless cars or technologies that facilitate ride or home sharing, could disrupt the demand for our products from current customers, create coverage issues or impact the frequency or severity of losses, and we may not be able to respond effectively. in addition, our competitive position could be impacted by our ability to deploy, in a cost effective manner, technology that collects and analyzes a wide variety of data points (so-called "big data" analysis) to make underwriting or other decisions. see also "our business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology" below.
in recent years, we have undertaken various actions to improve our underwriting margins on many of our insurance products, and competitive dynamics may impact the success of these efforts. these efforts include seeking improved rates, as well as improved terms and conditions, and also include other initiatives, such as reducing operating expenses and acquisition costs. these efforts may not continue to be successful and/or may result in lower retention and new business levels and therefore lower business volumes. in addition, if our underwriting is not effective, further efforts to increase rates could also lead to "adverse selection", whereby accounts retained have higher losses, and are less profitable, than accounts lost. for more detail, see "item 7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsoutlook."
in particular, in our agency automobile line of business, we have undertaken various actions to improve our underwriting margins, which have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by various factors. see "item 1businesspersonal insurancecompetition" above for a description of some of these actions, including the offer of a new, more competitively-priced product. these factors include (i) changes in customer preferences and demand for direct distribution channels, (ii) utilization of comparative rating technologies by agents and/or technology companies and (iii) other technological changes, as described above. if our strategies to increase profitability in the agency automobile line of business are not effective, we may need to explore other actions or initiatives to improve our competitive position and profitability in this line of business.
61
overall, our competitive position in our various businesses is based on many factors, including but not limited to our:
 ability to profitably price our business, retain existing customers and obtain new business;
 premiums charged, contract terms and conditions, products and services offered (including the ability to design customized programs);
 agent, broker and client relationships;
 ability to keep pace relative to our competitors with changes in technology and information systems;
 speed of claims payment;
 ability to provide our products and services in a cost effective manner;
 perceived overall financial strength and corresponding ratings assigned by independent rating agencies;
 reputation, experience and qualifications of employees;
 geographic scope of business; and
 local presence.
we may have difficulty in continuing to compete successfully on any of these bases in the future. if competition limits our ability to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. see "competition" sections of the discussion on business segments in "item 1business."
we may not be able to collect all amounts due to us from reinsurers and reinsurance coverage may not be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all.    although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the ceded reinsurance, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. as a result, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. accordingly, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.
in the past, certain reinsurers have ceased writing business and entered into runoff. some of our reinsurance claims may be disputed by the reinsurers, and we may ultimately receive partial or no payment. this is a particular risk in the case of claims that relate to insurance policies written many years ago, including those relating to asbestos and environmental claims. in addition, in a number of jurisdictions, particularly the european union and the united kingdom, a reinsurer is permitted to transfer a reinsurance arrangement to another reinsurer, which may be less creditworthy, without a counterparty's consent, provided that the transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory and/or court authority.
included in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to certain structured settlements. structured settlements are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. in cases where we did not receive a release from the claimant, the structured settlement is included in reinsurance recoverables and the related claim cost is included in the liability for claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, as we retain the contingent liability to the claimant. if it is expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, we would recognize an impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations. in the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, we would be required to make such payments.
62
many life insurance companies were negatively impacted by the financial markets disruption and the economic downturn beginning in 2008. a number of these companies, including certain of those with which we conduct business or to which we otherwise have credit exposure, were downgraded by various rating agencies during this time period. for a discussion of our top reinsurance groups by reinsurance recoverable and the top five groups by amount of structured settlements provided, see "item 7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsreinsurance recoverables."
the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, both in terms of price and available capacity. the availability of reinsurance capacity can be impacted by general economic conditions and conditions in the reinsurance market, such as the occurrence of significant reinsured events. the availability and cost of reinsurance could affect our business volume and profitability.
because of the risks set forth above, we may not be able to collect all amounts due to us from reinsurers, and reinsurance coverage may not be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all, and/or life insurance companies may fail to make required annuity payments, and thus our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we are exposed to credit risk in certain of our business and investment operations including reinsurance or structured settlements.    in addition to exposure to credit risk related to our investment portfolio and reinsurance recoverables (discussed above), we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business operations, including credit risk relating to policyholders, independent agents and brokers.
we are exposed to credit risk in our surety insurance operations, where we guarantee to a third party that our customer will satisfy certain performance obligations (e.g., a construction contract) or certain financial obligations, including exposure to large customers who may have obligations to multiple third parties. if our customer defaults, we may suffer losses and not be reimbursed by that customer. in addition, it is customary practice in the surety business for multiple insurers to participate as co-sureties on large surety bonds. under these arrangements, the co-surety obligations are typically joint and several, in which case we are also exposed to credit risk with respect to our co-sureties.
in addition, a portion of our business is written with large deductible insurance policies. under casualty insurance contracts with deductible features, we are obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim. we are subsequently reimbursed by the contractholder for the deductible amount, and, as a result, we are exposed to credit risk to the policyholder. moreover, certain policyholders purchase retrospectively rated workers' compensation policies (i.e., policies in which premiums are adjusted after the policy period based on the actual loss experience of the policyholder during the policy period). retrospectively rated policies expose us to additional credit risk to the extent that the adjusted premium is greater than the original premium.
our efforts to mitigate the credit risk that we have to our insureds may not be successful. to reduce such credit risk, we require certain insureds to post collateral for some or all of these obligations, often in the form of pledged securities such as money market funds or letters of credit provided by banks, surety bonds or cash. in cases where we receive pledged securities and the insureds are unable to honor their obligations, we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged and/or the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed during an insured's bankruptcy. in cases where we receive letters of credit from banks and the insureds are unable to honor their obligations, we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of credit.
in accordance with industry practice, when policyholders purchase insurance policies from us through independent agents and brokers, the premiums relating to those policies are often paid to the agents and brokers for payment to us. in most jurisdictions, the premiums will be deemed to have been
63
paid to us whether or not they are actually received by us. consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with amounts due from independent agents and brokers.
to a large degree, the credit risk we face is a function of the economy; accordingly, we face a greater risk in an economic downturn. while we attempt to manage the risks discussed above through underwriting and investment guidelines, collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms, our efforts may not be successful. for example, collateral obtained may subsequently have little or no value. as a result, our exposure to the above credit risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
within the united states, our businesses are heavily regulated by the states in which we conduct business, including licensing and supervision, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.    these regulatory systems are generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, and not necessarily the interests of insurers, their shareholders and other investors. for example, to protect policyholders whose insurance company becomes financially insolvent, guaranty funds have been established in all 50 states to pay the covered claims of policyholders in the event of an insolvency of an insurer, subject to applicable state limits. the funding of guaranty funds is provided through assessments levied against remaining insurers in the marketplace. as a result, the insolvency of one or more insurance companies could result in additional assessments levied against us.
these regulatory systems also address authorization for lines of business, statutory capital and surplus requirements, limitations on the types and amounts of certain investments, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of an insurer's business.
in recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased scrutiny, and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. further, the naic and state insurance regulators continually re-examine existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations.
included in these changes is an amendment to insurance holding company regulations that require insurers who are part of a holding company system to file an enterprise risk report to provide the lead insurance regulator with a summary of the company's enterprise risk management (erm) framework including the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose risk to the insurance entities within the holding company system. beginning in 2015, insurers having premium volume above certain thresholds, including the company, will also be required to perform at least annually a self-assessment of their current and future risks, including their likely future solvency position (known as an own risk and solvency assessment or orsa) and file a confidential report with the insurer's lead insurance regulator. the orsa concept has two primary goals, which are to foster an effective level of erm at all insurers within the holding company system, and to provide a group wide perspective on risk and capital as a supplement to the legal entity view. orsa is now included in the international association of insurance supervisors (iais) standards and is in various stages of implementation in the united states, europe, canada, and other jurisdictions. it is possible that, as a result of orsa or other reasons, our states of domicile or other regulatory bodies will require changes in our erm process or take other regulatory actions that could limit our ability to write additional business or reduce our capital management flexibility. see "enterprise risk management" herein for further discussion of the company's erm.
the naic and state insurance regulators, as well as the federal reserve and federal insurance office, are currently working with the iais to develop a global common framework (comframe) for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups (iaigs). if adopted, comframe would require the designation of a group-wide supervisor (regulator) for each iaig and would impose a
64
group capital requirement that would be applied to an iaig in addition to the current legal entity capital requirements imposed by state insurance regulators. in response to comframe, the naic is developing a model law that would allow state insurance regulators in the u.s. to be designated as group-wide supervisors for u.s. based iaigs. additionally, the naic is developing a group capital standard that would be applied to u.s. based insurance groups. these regulatory developments could increase the amount of capital that the company is required to have and could result in the company being subject to increased regulatory requirements.
in a time of financial uncertainty or a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise, regulators may choose to adopt more restrictive insurance laws and regulations. for example, insurance regulators may choose to restrict the ability of insurance subsidiaries to make payments to their parent companies or reject rate increases due to the economic environment. the state insurance regulators may also increase the statutory capital and surplus requirements for our insurance subsidiaries. in addition, state tax laws that specifically impact the insurance industry, such as premium taxes or other taxes, may be enacted or changed by states to raise revenues.
state laws or regulations that are adopted or amended may be more restrictive than current laws or regulations and may result in lower revenues and/or higher costs of compliance and thus could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and limit our growth.
changes in federal regulation could impose significant burdens on us and otherwise adversely impact our results.    while the u.s. federal government has not historically regulated the insurance business, in 2010, the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the dodd-frank act) established a federal insurance office (the fio) within the u.s. department of the treasury. the fio has limited regulatory authority and is empowered to gather data and information regarding the insurance industry and insurers. in december 2013, the fio released a report recommending ways to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the united states. while the report did not recommend full federal regulation of insurance, it did suggest an expanded federal role in some circumstances. in addition, the report suggested that congress should consider direct federal involvement to fill regulatory gaps identified in the report, should those gaps persist, for example, by considering either establishing a federal coordinating body or a direct regulator of select aspects of the industry, such as large complex institutions or institutions that seek a federal charter, if a law is passed to allow a federal charter. it is not clear as to the extent, if any, the report will lead to regulatory changes or how any such changes would impact the company.
the dodd-frank act also gives the federal reserve supervisory authority over a number of nonbank financial services holding companies, including insurance companies, if they are designated by a two-thirds vote of a financial stability oversight council (the fsoc) as "systemically important financial institutions" (sifi). the fsoc, chaired by the secretary of the treasury, is a group of federal financial regulators, a state insurance regulator and an independent insurance expert. the fsoc considers companies for designation as a sifi annually and finalized its first set of sifi designations in 2013. the company, based upon the fsoc's rules and interpretive guidance, has not been designated as a sifi. nonetheless, it is possible that the council may change its rules or interpretations in the future and conclude that we are a sifi. if we were designated as a sifi, the federal reserve's supervisory authority could include the ability to impose heightened financial regulation and could impact requirements regarding our capital, liquidity and leverage as well as our business and investment conduct. as a result of the foregoing, the dodd-frank act, or other additional federal regulation that is adopted in the future, could impose significant burdens on us, including impacting the ways in which we conduct our business, increasing compliance costs and duplicating state regulation, and could result in a competitive disadvantage, particularly relative to other insurers that may not be subject to the same level of regulation. changes in the u.s. regulatory framework could impact the overall competitive environment by imposing additional burdens on us and allowing other competitors not subject to these same burdens to enter or expand their insurance businesses.
65
even if we are not subject to additional regulation by the federal government, significant financial sector regulatory reform, including the dodd-frank act, could have a significant impact on us. for example, regulatory reform could have an unexpected impact on our rights as a creditor or on our competitive position. in particular, the dodd-frank act authorizes assessments to pay for the resolution of systemically important financial institutions that have become insolvent. we (as a financial company with more than $50 billion in assets) could be assessed, and, although any such assessment is required to be risk weighted (i.e., riskier firms pay more), such costs could be material to us and are not currently estimable.
other potential changes in u.s. federal legislation, regulation and/or administrative policies, including the potential repeal of the mccarran-ferguson act (which exempts insurance from most federal regulation) and potential changes in federal taxation, could also significantly harm the insurance industry, including us.
a downgrade in our claims-paying and financial strength ratings could adversely impact our business volumes, adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase our borrowing costs.    claims-paying and financial strength ratings are important to an insurer's competitive position. rating agencies periodically review insurers' ratings and change their ratings criteria; therefore, our current ratings may not be maintained in the future. a downgrade in one or more of our ratings could negatively impact our business volumes because demand for certain of our products may be reduced, particularly because many customers may require that we maintain minimum ratings to enter into or renew business with us. additionally, we may find it more difficult to access the capital markets and we may incur higher borrowing costs. if significant losses, including, but not limited to, those resulting from one or more major catastrophes, or significant reserve additions or significant investment losses were to cause our capital position to deteriorate significantly, or if one or more rating agencies substantially increase their capital requirements, we may need to raise equity capital in the future (which we may not be able to do at a reasonable cost or at all, especially at a time of financial market disruption) in order to maintain our ratings or limit the extent of a downgrade. a continued trend of more frequent and severe weather-related catastrophes or a prolonged financial market disruption or economic downturn may lead rating agencies to substantially increase their capital requirements. see also "during or following a period of financial market disruption or economic downturn, our business could be materially and adversely affected." for further discussion about our ratings, see, "item 1businessratings."
the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations, pay future shareholder dividends or make future share repurchases.    our holding company relies on dividends from our u.s. insurance subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt, to pay dividends to shareholders, to make contributions to our qualified domestic pension plan, to pay other corporate expenses and to make share repurchases. the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company in the future will depend on their statutory capital and surplus, earnings and regulatory restrictions.
we are subject to state insurance regulation as an insurance holding company system. our u.s. insurance subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the maximum amount of dividends available to be paid to their parent without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities. in a time of prolonged economic downturn or otherwise, insurance regulators may choose to further restrict the ability of insurance subsidiaries to make payments to their parent companies. the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company is also restricted by regulations that set standards of solvency that must be met and maintained.
66
the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company in an amount sufficient to meet our debt service obligations and other cash requirements could harm our ability to meet our obligations, to pay future shareholder dividends and to make share repurchases.
disruptions to our relationships with our independent agents and brokers could adversely affect us.    we market our insurance products primarily through independent agents and brokers. an important part of our business is written through less than a dozen such intermediaries. further, there has been a trend of increased consolidation by agents and brokers, which could impact our relationships with, and fees paid to, some agents and brokers, and/or otherwise negatively impact the pricing or distribution of our products. agents and brokers may increasingly compete with us to the extent that markets increasingly provide them with direct access to providers of capital seeking exposure to insurance risk. see also "the intense competition that we face could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability." in all of the foregoing situations, loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided through such agents and brokers could materially and adversely affect our future business volume and results of operations.
we may also seek to develop new products or distribution channels, including our establishment of a direct-to-consumer platform in the personal insurance segment and our new quantum 2.0 auto product. in addition, agents and brokers may create alternate distribution channels for commercial business, such as insurance exchanges, that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing. access to greater levels of data and increased utilization of technology by agents and brokers may also impact our relationship with them and our competitive position. our efforts or their efforts with respect to new products or alternate distribution channels, as well as changes in the way agents and brokers utilize data and technology, could adversely impact our business relationship with independent agents and brokers who currently market our products, resulting in a lower volume of business generated from these sources.
we rely on internet applications for the marketing and sale of certain of our products, and we may increasingly rely on internet applications and toll-free numbers for distribution. in some instances, our agents and brokers are required to access separate business platforms to execute the sale of our personal insurance or commercial insurance products. should internet disruptions occur, or frustration with our business platforms or distribution initiatives develop among our independent agents and brokers, any resulting loss of business could materially and adversely affect our future business volume and results of operations. see "if we experience difficulties with technology, data security and/or outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct our business could be negatively impacted" below.
customers in the past have brought claims against us for the actions of our agents. even with proper controls in place, actual or alleged errors or inaccuracies by our agents could result in our involvement in disputes, litigation or regulatory actions related to actions taken or not taken by our agents.
our efforts to develop new products or expand in targeted markets may not be successful and may create enhanced risks.    a number of our recent and planned business initiatives involve developing new products or expanding existing products in targeted markets. this includes the following efforts, from time to time, to protect or grow market share:
 we may develop products that insure risks we have not previously insured, contain new coverage or coverage terms or contain different commission terms. for example, in response to the competitive environment in personal auto insurance, we have rolled out a new product called quantum auto 2.0 that is intended to be more competitively-priced. see "item 1businesspersonal insurancecompetition."
67
 we may refine our underwriting processes. for example, in certain of our businesses in recent years, we have substantially increased the volume of business that flows through our automated underwriting and pricing systems.
 we may seek to expand distribution channels, such as our establishment of a direct-to-consumer platform in personal insurance.
 we may focus on geographic markets within or outside of the united states where we have had relatively little or no market share.
we may not be successful in introducing new products or expanding in targeted markets and, even if we are successful, these efforts may create enhanced risks. among other risks:
 demand for new products or in new markets may not meet our expectations.
 to the extent we are able to market new products or expand in new markets, our risk exposures may change, and the data and models we use to manage such exposures may not be as sophisticated or effective as those we use in existing markets or with existing products. this, in turn, could lead to losses in excess of our expectations.
 models underlying automated underwriting and pricing decisions may not be effective.
 efforts to develop new products or markets have the potential to create or increase distribution channel conflict, such as described above under "disruptions to our relationships with our independent agents and brokers could adversely affect us."
 in connection with the conversion of existing policyholders to a new product, some policyholders' pricing may increase, while the pricing for other policyholders may decrease, the net impact of which could negatively impact retention and profit margins.
 to develop new products or markets, we may need to make substantial capital and operating expenditures, which may also negatively impact results in the near term.
if our efforts to develop new products or expand in targeted markets are not successful, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results.    the profitability of our property and casualty business substantially depends on the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we use in pricing our policies. we utilize third-party and proprietary models to help us price business in a manner that is intended to be consistent, over time, with actual results and return objectives. we incorporate the company's historical loss experience, external industry data and economic indices into our modeling processes, and we use various methods, including predictive modeling, forecasting and sophisticated simulation modeling techniques, to analyze loss trends and the risks associated with our assets and liabilities. we also use these modeling processes, analyses and methods in making underwriting, pricing and reinsurance decisions as part of managing our exposure to catastrophes and other extreme adverse events. these modeling processes incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of: interest rates, inflation, capital requirements, and frequency and severity of losses, among others, that are difficult to make and may differ materially from actual results.
whether we use a proprietary or third-party model, future experience may be materially different from past and current experience incorporated in a model's forecasts or simulations. this includes the likelihood of events occurring or continuing or the correlation among events. third party models may provide substantially different indications than what our proprietary modeling processes provide. as a result, third-party model estimates of losses can be, and often have been, materially different for similar events in comparison to our proprietary estimates. the differences between third-party model estimates
68
and our proprietary estimates are driven by the use of different data sets as well as different assumptions and forecasts regarding the frequency and severity of events and claims arising from the events.
if we fail to appropriately price the risks we insure, or fail to change our pricing model to appropriately reflect our current experience, or if our claims experience is more frequent or severe than our underlying risk assumptions, our profit margins may be negatively affected. if we underestimate the frequency and/or severity of extreme adverse events occurring, our financial condition may be adversely affected. if we overestimate the risks we are exposed to, we may overprice our products, and new business growth and retention of our existing business may be adversely affected. as we expand into different markets and geographies, we will write more policies in markets and geographical areas where we have less data specific to these new markets and geographies, and, accordingly, we may be more susceptible to error in our models and strategy. see "item 7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscatastrophe modeling."
our business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology.    we depend in large part on our technology systems for conducting business and processing claims, as well as for providing the data and analytics we utilize to manage our business, and thus our business success is dependent on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and on continuing to develop and enhance technology systems that support our business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost and resource efficient manner. some system development projects are long-term in nature, may negatively impact our expense ratios as we invest in the projects and may cost more than we expect to complete. in addition, system development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are complete, or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected, which could result in accelerated recognition of expenses. if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio, including with respect to the technology portfolio of our recently acquired businesses, or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect, our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a cost effective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted.
if we experience difficulties with technology, data and network security and/or outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct our business could be negatively impacted.    while technology can streamline many business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations, technology initiatives present significant risks. our business is highly dependent upon our employees' ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions. a shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities (including our primary data processing facility); a power outage; or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis, particularly if such an interruption lasts for an extended period of time. in the event of a computer virus or disaster such as a natural catastrophe, terrorist attack or industrial accident, our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time. in addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems increasingly interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. business interruptions and failures of controls could also result if our internal systems do not interface with each other as intended, including as it relates to recently acquired businesses. business continuity can also be disrupted by an event, such as a pandemic, that renders large numbers of a workforce unable to work as needed, particularly at critical locations; for example, our largest location employs about 20% of our employees. if our business continuity plans did not sufficiently address a business interruption, system failure or service denial, this could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions.
69
our operations rely on the reliable and secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. computer viruses, hackers and employee or vendor misconduct, and other external hazards, could expose our data systems to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other disruptions. in addition, we routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by e-mail and other electronic means. while we attempt to develop secure transmission capabilities with third-party vendors and others with whom we do business, we may be unable to put in place secure capabilities with all of such vendors and third parties and, in addition, these third parties may not have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information.
like other global companies, our computer systems are regularly subject to and will continue to be the target of computer viruses, malware or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer-related penetrations. while we have experienced threats to our data and systems, to date, we are not aware that we have experienced a material breach of cyber-security. however, over time, and particularly recently, the sophistication of these threats continues to increase. our administrative and technical controls as well as other preventative actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information may be insufficient to detect or prevent unauthorized access, other physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems or those of third parties with whom we do business. in addition, new technology that could result in greater operational efficiency may further expose our computer systems to the risk of cyber-attacks.
we have increasingly outsourced certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may continue to do so in the future. if we do not effectively develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing relationships, third party providers do not perform as anticipated or we experience technological or other problems with a transition, we may not realize expected productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business. our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to increased risk related to data security or service disruptions, which could result in monetary and reputational damages. for example, while it did not materially and adversely impact our operations or results, we terminated a contract with one of our outsourcing vendors in the fourth quarter of 2013 because they breached that contract by providing proprietary company information to one of our competitors. in addition to risks caused by third party providers, our ability to receive services from third party providers outside of the united states might be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, unanticipated regulatory requirements or public policy inside or outside of the united states.
the increased risks identified above could expose us to data loss, disruption of service, monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs and costs to improve the security and resiliency of our computer systems. the compromise of personal, confidential or proprietary information could also subject us to legal liability or regulatory action under evolving cyber-security, data protection and privacy laws and regulations enacted by the u.s. federal and state governments, the european union or other jurisdictions or by various regulatory organizations or exchanges. as a result, our ability to conduct our business and our results of operations might be materially and adversely affected.
we are subject to a number of risks associated with our business outside the united states.    we conduct business outside the united states primarily in canada, the united kingdom and the republic of ireland. in addition, we have a joint venture in brazil and may also explore opportunities in other countries, including latin american countries and other emerging markets such as india.
in conducting business outside of the united states, we are subject to a number of significant risks, particularly in emerging economies. these risks include restrictions such as price controls, capital

controls, currency exchange limits, ownership limits and other restrictive or anti-competitive governmental actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation. following the completion of our acquisition of dominion, a larger portion of our premiums from outside of the united states are now comprised of premiums generated in canada, a substantial portion of which consists of automobile premiums from the province of ontario, which is a highly regulated market. our business activities outside the united states may also subject us to currency risk and, in some markets, it may be difficult to effectively hedge that risk, or we may choose not to hedge that risk. in addition, in some markets, we may invest as part of a joint venture with a local counterparty. because our governance rights may be limited, we may not have control over the ability of the joint venture to make certain decisions and/or mitigate risks it faces, and significant disagreements with a joint venture counterparty may adversely impact our investment.
our business activities outside the united states also subject us to additional domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws in other countries that prohibit the making of improper payments to foreign officials. although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws, if those controls are ineffective and an employee or intermediary fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties and our business and our reputation could be adversely affected. some countries, particularly emerging economies, have laws and regulations that lack clarity and, even with local expertise and effective controls, it can be difficult to determine the exact requirements of, and potential liability under, the local laws. for example, in some jurisdictions, including brazil, parties to a joint venture may, in some circumstances, have liability for some obligations of the venture, and that liability may extend beyond the capital invested. failure to comply with local laws in a particular market may result in substantial liability and could have a significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally.
in addition, competition for skilled employees in developing markets and other non-u.s. locations may be intense. if we are not able to hire, integrate, motivate and retain a sufficient number of employees with the knowledge and background necessary for our global businesses, those businesses and our results of operations may be adversely affected.
new regulations outside of the united states, including in the european union, could adversely impact our results of operations and limit our growth.    insurance laws or regulations that are adopted or amended in jurisdictions outside the u.s. may be more restrictive than current laws or regulations and may result in lower revenues and/or higher costs of compliance and thus could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and limit our growth.
in particular, the european union's executive body, the european commission, is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations called solvency ii that would apply to the company's businesses across the european union. the implementation date of solvency ii has been delayed until january 1, 2016, although some aspects, including governance guidelines, own risk assessments and regulatory reporting, are being phased in before the full implementation date. under solvency ii, it is possible that the u.s. parent of a european union subsidiary could be subject to certain solvency ii requirements if the regulator determines that the subsidiary's capital position is dependent on the parent company and the u.s. company is not already subject to regulations deemed "equivalent" to solvency ii. in addition, regulators in countries where the company has operations are working with the international association of insurance supervisors (iais) (and with the naic, the federal reserve and fio in the u.s.) to consider changes to insurance company supervision, including group supervision and group capital requirements.
in july 2013, the iais published a methodology for identifying "global systemically important insurers" (g-siis) and high level policy measures that will apply to the g-siis. the methodology and measures were endorsed by the financial stability board (fsb) created by the g-20. using the iais
71
methodology, the fsb, working with national authorities and the iais, identified nine insurers that they designated as g-siis. the iais is working on the policy measures which include higher capital requirements and enhanced supervision. the company has not been designated as a g-sii by the fsb; however, the fsb updates the list annually, and it is possible that the methodologies could be amended or interpreted differently in the future and the company could be named as a g-sii.
the iais also is in the process of developing the common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups (comframe). the iais released a consultation draft in october 2013, which may lead to similar policy measures as those being developed for g-siis, including group supervision and an insurance capital standard (i.e., global group capital requirement). the iais revised the comframe guidance based on comments received and is currently in the process of field testing many of the requirements. the company would be considered an internationally active insurance group under the current consultation draft. it is possible that comframe, if adopted, could lead to enhanced supervision and higher capital standards on a global basis if the iais, the naic and the individual states adopt the proposed or similar provisions.
while it is not yet known how or if these actions will impact us, such regulation could result in increased costs of compliance, increased disclosure and less flexibility in our capital management, and could adversely impact our results of operations and limit our growth.
loss of or significant restrictions on the use of particular types of underwriting criteria, such as credit scoring, in the pricing and underwriting of our products could reduce our future profitability.    our underwriting profitability depends in large part on our ability to competitively price our products at a level that will adequately compensate us for the risks assumed. as a result, risk selection and pricing through the application of actuarially sound and segmented underwriting criteria is critical. however, laws or regulations, or judicial or administrative findings, could significantly curtail the use of particular types of underwriting criteria. for example, we may use credit scoring as a factor in pricing decisions where allowed by state law. some consumer groups and/or regulators have alleged that the use of credit scoring violates the law by discriminating against persons belonging to a protected class and are calling for the prohibition or restrictions on the use of credit scoring in underwriting and pricing. a variety of other underwriting criteria used in personal and commercial insurance have been and continue to be criticized by regulators, government agencies, consumer groups or individuals on similar or other grounds. resulting regulatory actions or litigation could result in negative publicity and/or generate adverse rules or findings, such as curtailing the use of important underwriting criteria, each of which could adversely affect our future profitability.
acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may result in operating difficulties and other unintended consequences.    from time to time we may investigate and pursue acquisition opportunities if we believe that such opportunities are consistent with our long-term objectives and that the potential rewards of an acquisition justify the risks. for example, in november 2013, we acquired dominion and significantly expanded our canadian operations. the process of integrating an acquired company or business can be complex and costly, however, and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. for example, acquisitions may present significant risks, including:
 the potential disruption of our ongoing business;
 the ineffective integration of, or other difficulties with, underwriting, risk management, claims handling, information technology and actuarial practices;
 uncertainties related to an acquiree's reserve estimates and its design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting;
 the diversion of management time and resources to acquisition integration challenges;
 the loss of key employees;
72
 unforeseen liabilities;
 the cultural challenges associated with integrating employees; and
 the impact on our financial position and/or credit ratings.
acquired businesses may not perform as projected, any cost savings and other synergies anticipated from the acquisition may not materialize and costs associated with the integration may be greater than anticipated. acquired businesses may not be successfully integrated, resulting in substantial costs or delays and adversely affecting our ability to compete. accordingly, our results of operations might be materially and adversely affected.
we could be adversely affected if our controls designed to ensure compliance with guidelines, policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective.    our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting, claim processing and investment activities, many of which are highly complex. these activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies, as well as legal and regulatory standards. a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. if our controls are not effective, it could lead to financial loss, unanticipated risk exposure (including underwriting, credit and investment risk) or damage to our reputation.
in addition, ineffective controls, including with respect to our recently acquired businesses, could lead to litigation or regulatory action. the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against various types of financial institutions have increased in recent years. substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse financial impact. see note 16 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are involved.
our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees.    there is significant competition from within the property and casualty insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for qualified employees, especially those in key positions and those possessing highly specialized underwriting knowledge. our performance is largely dependent on the talents, efforts and proper conduct of highly-skilled individuals, including our senior executives (many of whom have decades of experience in the insurance industry), and the board of directors regularly engages in succession discussions. each of our chief executive officer, president, chief financial officer and chief investment officer is highly experienced and over 61 years of age, and our chief executive officer announced in 2014 that he had been diagnosed with a neuromuscular condition. see "item 10directors, executive officers and corporate governance" for more information relating to our executive officers, including our senior leaders. for many of our senior positions, we compete for talent not just with insurance or financial service companies, but with other large companies and other businesses. our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses and to expand into new business areas depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. if we are not able to successfully attract, retain and motivate our employees, our business, financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected.
intellectual property is important to our business, and we may be unable to protect and enforce our own intellectual property or we may be subject to claims for infringing the intellectual property of others.    our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary trademarks, technology and other intellectual property. see "item 1other informationintellectual property." we may not, however, be able to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use and disclosure by others. further, the intellectual property laws may not prevent our competitors from independently developing trademarks, products and services that are similar to ours. moreover, the agreements we execute to protect our intellectual property rights may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies in response. our attempts to patent or register our intellectual property rights
73
in the u.s. and worldwide may not succeed initially or may later be challenged by third parties. further, the laws of certain countries outside the united states may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. we may incur significant costs in our efforts to protect and enforce our intellectual property, including the initiation of expensive and protracted litigation, and we may not prevail. any inability to enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.
we may be subject to claims by third parties from time to time that our products, services and technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights. in recent years, certain entities have acquired patents in order to allege claims of infringement against companies, including in some cases, us. any intellectual property infringement claims brought against us could cause us to spend significant time and money to defend ourselves, regardless of the merits of the claims. if we are found to infringe any third-party intellectual property rights, it could result in reputational harm, payment of significant monetary damages, payment of license fees (if licenses are even available to us, on reasonable terms or otherwise) and/or substantial time and expense to redesign our products, services or technologies to avoid the infringement. in addition, we use third-party software in some of our products, services and technologies. if any of our software vendors or licensors are faced with infringement claims, we may lose our ability to use such software until the dispute is resolved. if we cannot successfully redesign an infringing product, service or technology (or procure a substitute version), this could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.
changes to existing accounting standards may adversely impact our reported results.    as a u.s.-based sec registrant, we are currently required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap), as promulgated by the financial accounting standards board (fasb), subject to the accounting-related rules and interpretations of the securities and exchange commission (sec). during the last several years, the sec has been evaluating whether, when and how international financial reporting standards (ifrs) should be incorporated into the u.s. financial reporting system, including for companies such as us. in december 2014, the sec indicated that it plans to explore allowing ifrs financial statements or financial information as supplemental information in sec filings.
the fasb and the international accounting standards board (iasb) have been working on a long-term project to converge u.s. gaap and ifrs, which included a project on insurance accounting. while the fasb decided during 2014 to retain current u.s. gaap for property and casualty insurance contracts, the iasb is continuing its development of a new model that is significantly different than current u.s. gaap.
we are not able to predict whether we will choose to, or be required to, adopt ifrs or how the adoption of ifrs (or the convergence of u.s. gaap and ifrs, including the project on the accounting for insurance contracts) may impact our financial statements in the future. changes in accounting standards, particularly those that specifically apply to insurance company operations, may impact the content and presentation of our reported financial results and could cause increased volatility in reported earnings, resulting in other adverse impacts on the company's ratings and cost of capital, and decrease the understandability of our financial results as well as the comparability of our reported results with other insurers.
changes in u.s. tax laws or in the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact us.    tax laws may change in ways that adversely impact us. for example, federal tax legislation could be enacted to reduce the existing statutory u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35%, which would, accordingly, reduce any u.s. deferred tax asset. the amount of any net deferred tax asset is volatile and significantly impacted by changes in unrealized investment gains and losses. the effect of a reduction in a tax rate on net deferred tax assets is required to be recognized, in full, as a reduction of income from continuing operations in the period when enacted and, along with
74
other changes in the tax rules that may increase the company's actual tax expense, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
our investment portfolio has benefited from tax exemptions and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits (such as foreign tax credits). federal and/or state tax legislation could be enacted in connection with deficit reduction or various types of fundamental tax reform that would lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting us and therefore could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. in addition, such legislation could adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio, particularly changes to the taxation of interest from municipal bonds (which comprise 46% of our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2014) could materially and adversely impact the value of those bonds.
other tax law changes could adversely impact us. the size of the federal deficit, as well as the budget constraints faced by many states and localities, increases the likelihood that congress and state and local governments will raise revenue by enacting legislation increasing the taxes paid by individuals and corporations.

the following discussions of the company's net income and segment operating income are presented on an after-tax basis. discussions of the components of net income and segment operating income are presented on a pretax basis, unless otherwise noted. discussions of earnings per common share are presented on a diluted basis.
overview diluted net income per share of $10.70 in 2014 increased by 10% over diluted net income per share of $9.74 in 2013. net income of $3.69 billion in 2014 increased slightly over net income of $3.67 billion in 2013. the higher rate of increase in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in recent periods. the slight increase in net income was primarily driven by the pretax impacts of (i) higher underwriting margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development ("underlying underwriting margins"), (ii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development and (iii) higher net investment income, partially offset by (iv) higher catastrophe losses, (v) a decline in other revenues due to a gain from the settlement of a legal matter in 2013 and (vi) lower net realized investment gains. catastrophe losses in 2014 and 2013 were $709 million and $591 million, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 was
81
$941 million and $840 million, respectively. the improvement in underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from the impacts of (i) earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends in each of the company's business segments, (ii) lower reinsurance costs and (iii) a 2014 reduction in the estimated liability for state assessments to be paid by the company related to workers' compensation premiums, partially offset by (iv) an increase in non-catastrophe weather-related losses and (v) a higher level of what the company defines as large losses. partially offsetting this net pretax increase in income was an increase in income tax expense. the higher effective tax rate in 2014 than in 2013 resulted from the impact of a $63 million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 due to the resolution of prior year tax matters, as well as interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax income in 2014 than in 2013.
diluted net income per share of $9.74 in 2013 increased by 55% over diluted net income per share of $6.30 in 2012. net income of $3.67 billion in 2013 increased by 49% over net income of $2.47 billion in 2012. the higher rate of increase in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in 2013 and 2012. the increase in net income primarily reflected the pretax impacts of (i) lower catastrophe losses, (ii) higher underlying underwriting margins, (iii) an increase in net realized investment gains and (iv) an increase in other revenues due to a gain from the settlement of a legal proceeding, partially offset by (v) lower net investment income and (vi) lower net favorable prior year reserve development. catastrophe losses in 2013 and 2012 were $591 million and $1.86 billion, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 was $840 million and $940 million, respectively. the improvement in underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends in each of the company's business segments. partially offsetting this net pretax increase in income was an increase in income tax expense. the higher effective tax rate in 2013 than in 2012 resulted from interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax income in 2013 than in 2012, partially offset by the resolution of prior year tax matters discussed above.
revenues earned premiums earned premiums in 2014 were $23.71 billion, $1.08 billion or 5% higher than in 2013. the increase in earned premiums in 2014 primarily reflected the impact of the acquisition of dominion on november 1, 2013. in the business and international insurance segment, earned premiums in 2014 increased by 9% over 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisition of dominion. in the bond & specialty insurance segment, earned premiums in 2014 increased by 5% over 2013. in the personal insurance segment, earned premiums in 2014 decreased by 3% from 2013.
earned premiums in 2013 were $22.64 billion, $280 million or 1% higher than in 2012. in the business and international insurance segment, earned premiums in 2013 increased by 4% over 2012. in the bond & specialty insurance segment, earned premiums in 2013 increased by 1% over 2012. in the personal insurance segment, earned premiums in 2013 decreased by 4% from 2012.
factors contributing to the changes in earned premiums in each segment in 2014 and 2013 compared with the respective prior year are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.

net investment income in 2014 was $2.79 billion, $71 million or 3% higher than in 2013. net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2014 was $2.24 billion, $66 million lower than in 2013, primarily resulting from lower long-term reinvestment yields available in the market, partially offset by the impact of the acquisition of dominion. net investment income generated by non-fixed maturity investments in 2014 was $573 million, $141 million higher than in 2013, primarily driven by higher returns from the company's private equity investments, as well as higher returns from real estate partnership investments.
net investment income in 2013 was $2.72 billion, $173 million or 6% lower than in 2012. net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2013 was $2.31 billion, $129 million lower than in 2012, primarily resulting from lower long-term reinvestment yields available in the market. net investment income generated by non-fixed maturity investments in 2013 was $432 million, $44 million lower than in 2012, primarily driven by lower returns from the company's real estate partnership investments.
fee income the national accounts market in the business and international insurance segment is the primary source of the company's fee-based business. the $43 million and $72 million increases in fee income in 2014 and 2013, respectively, compared with the respective prior years are described in the business and international insurance segment discussion that follows.
net realized investment gains the following table sets forth information regarding the company's net pretax realized investment gains.

net realized investment gains other-than-temporary impairment losses       $(26      )   $(15      )   $(15      )
other net realized investment gains          105           181           66
net realized investment gains                $79           $166          $51
other net realized investment gains other net realized investment gains in 2014 included $35 million of net realized gains resulting from the sale of substantially all of one of the company's real estate joint venture investments. the
83
remaining $70 million of other net realized gains in 2014 were primarily driven by $32 million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $24 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities, $8 million of net realized investment gains related to other investments and $6 million of net realized investment gains from real estate sales.
other net realized gains in 2013 of $181 million were primarily driven by $115 million of net realized gains associated with u.s. treasury futures contracts, which require daily mark-to-market settlement and are used from time to time to shorten the duration of the company's fixed maturity investment portfolio. the remaining $66 million of other net realized investment gains in 2013 were primarily driven by $41 million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $15 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities and $10 million of net realized investment gains related to other investments.
other net realized investment gains in 2012 of $66 million were primarily driven by $61 million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $19 million of net realized investment gains related to real estate and $8 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities. these net realized investment gains were partially offset by $14 million of net realized investment losses associated with u.s. treasury futures contracts and $8 million of net realized investment losses related to other investments.
other revenues the amount of other revenues in all years presented primarily consisted of installment premium charges. other revenues in 2013 also included a $91 million gain from the settlement of a legal proceeding, which is discussed in more detail in note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements, and a $20 million gain from the sale of renewal rights related to the company's national flood insurance program business.
claims and expenses claims and claim adjustment expenses claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2014 were $13.87 billion, $563 million or 4% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting (i) the impact of the acquisition of dominion, (ii) the impact of loss cost trends, (iii) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, (iv) higher catastrophe losses and (v) a higher level of what the company defines as large losses, partially offset by (vi) the impact of lower volumes of insured exposures (excluding the impact of the acquisition of dominion) and (vii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development. catastrophe losses in 2014 included multiple wind and hail storms in several regions of the united states and a winter storm in the mid-atlantic, midwestern and southeastern regions of the united states. catastrophe losses in 2013 resulted from multiple tornado, wind and hail storms in several regions of the united states, as well as floods in alberta, canada and storm xaver in the united kingdom. factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development in each segment are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2013 were $13.31 billion, $1.37 billion or 9% lower than in 2012, primarily reflecting (i) a decline in catastrophe losses and (ii) the impact of lower volumes of insured exposures (excluding the impact of the acquisition of dominion), partially offset by (iii) the impact of loss cost trends, (iv) the impact of the acquisition of dominion and (v) lower net favorable prior year reserve development. catastrophe losses in 2012 primarily resulted from storm sandy, as well as multiple tornado, wind and hail storms in several regions of the united states. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 was reduced by a $42 million charge that was precipitated by legislation in new york enacted during the first quarter of 2013 related to the new york fund for reopened cases for workers' compensation. factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve
84
development in each segment are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
significant catastrophe losses the company defines a "catastrophe" as an event that:
 is designated a catastrophe by internationally recognized organizations that track and report on insured losses resulting from catastrophic events, such as property claim services (pcs) for events in the united states and canada; and
 the company's estimates of its ultimate losses before reinsurance and taxes exceed a pre-established dollar threshold.
the company's threshold for disclosing catastrophes is determined at the reportable segment level. if a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is pierced and the other segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the company. the threshold for 2014 ranged from approximately $17 million to $30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes.
the following table presents for significant catastrophes the amount of losses recorded in each of the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, and the amount of related net unfavorable (favorable) prior year reserve development recognized in subsequent years as well as the estimate of ultimate losses at december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. for purposes of the table, a significant catastrophe is an event for which the company estimates its ultimate losses will be $100 million or more after reinsurance and before taxes.

amortization of deferred acquisition costs amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2014 was $3.88 billion, $61 million or 2% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisition of dominion, partially offset by declines in the personal insurance segment. amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2013 was $3.82 billion, $89 million or 2% lower than in 2012. amortization of deferred acquisition costs is discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.
85
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses in 2014 were $3.95 billion, $195 million or 5% higher than in 2013. the increase in 2014 primarily reflected the impact of the acquisition of dominion and increases in employee and technology related expenses, partially offset by a reduction in the estimated liability for state assessments primarily related to workers' compensation premiums. general and administrative expenses in 2013 were $3.76 billion, $147 million or 4% higher than in 2012. general and administrative expenses are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.
interest expense interest expense in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $369 million, $361 million and $378 million, respectively. the increase in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily reflected slightly higher average levels of debt outstanding. the decline in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily reflected lower average levels of debt outstanding.
income tax expense income tax expense in 2014 was $1.40 billion, $125 million or 10% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of a $63 million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters, as well as the tax effects of the $144 million increase in income before income taxes in 2014. income tax expense in 2013 was $1.27 billion, $579 million or 84% higher than in 2012, primarily reflecting the impact of the tax effects of the $1.78 billion increase in income before income taxes, partially offset by the impact of the $63 million reduction in income tax expense resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters in 2013.
the company's effective tax rate was 27%, 26% and 22% in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the effective tax rates in all years were lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the company's income tax provision. in addition, the effective tax rate for 2013 was reduced by the impact of the resolution of prior year tax matters.
combined ratio the combined ratio of 89.0% in 2014 was 0.8 points lower than the combined ratio of 89.8% in 2013.
the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 57.6% in 2014 was 0.3 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 57.9% in 2013. catastrophe losses accounted for 3.0 points and 2.6 points of the 2014 and 2013 loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 provided 3.9 points and 3.7 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. the 2014 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development ("underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio") was 0.5 points lower than the 2013 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends, partially offset by the impact of an increase in non-catastrophe weather-related losses and a higher level of what the company defines as large losses.
the underwriting expense ratio of 31.4% in 2014 was 0.5 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 31.9% in 2013, primarily reflecting lower commission expenses in the personal insurance segment and a reduction in the estimated liability for state assessments primarily related to workers' compensation premiums in the business and international insurance segment, partially offset by the increase in general and administrative expenses described above.
86
the combined ratio of 89.8% in 2013 was 7.3 points lower than the combined ratio of 97.1% in 2012.
the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 57.9% in 2013 was 7.0 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 64.9% in 2012. catastrophe losses accounted for 2.6 points and 8.3 points of the 2013 and 2012 loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 provided 3.7 points and 4.2 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. the 2013 underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 1.8 points lower than the 2012 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends in each of the company's business segments.
the underwriting expense ratio of 31.9% in 2013 was lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 32.2% in 2012, primarily reflecting the impact of growth in earned premiums in 2013.

combined ratio                               93.1          %   92.8          %   97.1          %
overview operating income in 2014 was $2.35 billion, $57 million or 2% lower than operating income of $2.40 billion in 2013. the decrease in operating income in 2014 primarily reflected an increase in income taxes and a slight decrease in operating income before income taxes. the slight decrease in operating income before income taxes reflected the pretax impacts of (i) lower net favorable prior year reserve development, (ii) a decline in other revenues due to a gain from the settlement of a legal matter in 2013 and (iii) higher catastrophe losses, largely offset by (iv) higher underlying underwriting margins and (v) an increase in net investment income. catastrophe losses in 2014 and 2013 were $367 million and $333 million, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 was $322 million and $399 million, respectively. the improvement in underlying underwriting margins in 2014 primarily reflected (i) earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and (ii) a reduction in the estimated liability for state assessments to be paid by the company related to workers' compensation premiums, partially offset by (iii) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses and (iv) a higher level of what the company defines as large losses. the increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the impact of a $43 million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters. the higher effective tax rate in 2014 than in 2013 primarily resulted from the impact of the reduction in income tax expense in 2013 described above.
operating income in 2013 was $2.40 billion, $423 million or 21% higher than operating income of $1.98 billion in 2012. the increase in operating income primarily reflected the pretax impacts of (i) lower catastrophe losses, (ii) higher underlying underwriting margins and (iii) an increase in other revenues due to a gain from the settlement of a legal matter, partially offset by (iv) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and (v) lower net investment income. catastrophe losses in 2013 and 2012 were $333 million and $829 million, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 was $399 million and $585 million, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 was reduced by a $42 million charge that was precipitated by legislation in new york as described in the consolidated "claims and claim adjustment expenses" section above. the improvement in underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends. partially offsetting this net pretax increase in operating income was an increase in income tax expense. the higher effective tax rate in 2013 than in 2012 primarily resulted from the impact of interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than
88
the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax income in 2013 than in 2012, partially offset by the resolution of prior year tax matters in 2013 described above.
revenues earned premiums earned premiums in 2014 were $14.51 billion, $1.18 billion or 9% higher than in 2013. earned premiums in 2013 were $13.33 billion, $553 million or 4% higher than in 2012. the increases in both 2014 and 2013 reflected the impact of an increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months. the increase in net written premiums in 2014 was primarily due to the acquisition of dominion. the increase in net written premiums in 2013 also included, to a lesser extent, the impact of the acquisition of dominion, which occurred on november 1, 2013.
net investment income net investment income in 2014 was $2.16 billion, $69 million or 3% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisition of dominion. net investment income in 2013 was $2.09 billion, $118 million or 5% lower than in 2012. included in the business and international insurance segment are certain legal entities whose invested assets and related net investment income are reported exclusively in this segment and not allocated among all business segments. refer to the "net investment income" section of the "consolidated results of operations" discussion herein for a description of the factors contributing to the changes in the company's consolidated net investment income in 2014 and 2013 compared with the respective prior years. in addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements herein for a discussion of the company's net investment income allocation methodology.
fee income national accounts is the primary source of fee income due to its service businesses, which include claim and loss prevention services to large companies that choose to self-insure a portion of their insurance risks, as well as claims and policy management services to workers' compensation residual market pools. fee income in 2014 increased by $43 million or 11% over 2013. fee income in 2013 increased by $72 million or 22% over 2012. the increases in both years primarily reflected higher serviced premium volume in workers' compensation residual market pools and higher claim volume in the large deductible business.
other revenues other revenues in 2013 included a $91 million gain from the settlement of a legal proceeding, which is discussed in more detail in note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
claims and expenses claims and claim adjustment expenses claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2014 were $9.15 billion, $860 million or 10% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting (i) the impact of the acquisition of dominion, (ii) the impact of loss cost trends, (iii) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, (iv) a higher level of what the company defines as large losses, (v) a decline in net favorable prior year reserve development and (vi) higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by (vii) the impact of lower volumes of insured exposures (excluding the impact of the acquisition of dominion). factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
89
claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2013 were $8.29 billion, $98 million or 1% lower than in 2012, primarily reflecting (i) a decline in catastrophe losses and (ii) the impact of a modest decline in volumes of insured exposures (excluding dominion), partially offset by (iii) the impact of loss cost trends, (iv) a decrease in net favorable prior year reserve development and (v) the impact of the acquisition of dominion. factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
amortization of deferred acquisition costs amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2014 was $2.32 billion, $163 million or 8% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisition of dominion. amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2013 was $2.16 billion, $58 million or 3% higher than in 2012. the increase in 2013 was generally consistent with the increase in earned premiums.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses in 2014 were $2.54 billion, $172 million or 7% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisition of dominion and increases in employee and technology related expenses, partially offset by a reduction in the estimated liability for state assessments primarily related to workers' compensation premiums. general and administrative expenses in 2013 were $2.37 billion, $65 million or 3% higher than in 2012, primarily due to the impact of the acquisition of dominion and higher employee and technology related costs.
income tax expense income tax expense in 2014 was $798 million, $40 million or 5% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of a $43 million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters, partially offset by the tax effect of the $17 million decrease in pre-tax operating income in 2014. income tax expense in 2013 was $758 million, $178 million or 31% higher than in 2012, primarily reflecting the tax effect of the $601 million increase in pre-tax operating income and the reduction in income tax expense in 2013 resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters discussed above.
combined ratio the combined ratio of 93.1% in 2014 was 0.3 points higher than the combined ratio of 92.8% in 2013.
the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 61.6% in 2014 was 0.8 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 60.8% in 2013. catastrophe losses in 2014 and 2013 accounted for 2.5 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in each year. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 provided 2.2 points and 3.0 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2014 was level with the 2013 ratio on the same basis, as the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends was offset by higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses and a higher level of what the company defines as large losses.
the underwriting expense ratio of 31.5% in 2014 was 0.5 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 32.0% in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in earned premiums and a reduction in the estimated liability for state assessments primarily related to workers' compensation premiums, partially offset by the increase in general and administrative expenses discussed above.
the combined ratio of 92.8% in 2013 was 4.3 points lower than the combined ratio of 97.1% in 2012.
90
the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 60.8% in 2013 was 3.5 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 64.3% in 2012. catastrophe losses in 2013 and 2012 accounted for 2.5 points and 6.5 points, respectively, of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 provided 3.0 points and 4.6 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. the 2013 underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 1.1 points lower than the 2012 ratio on the same basis, reflecting the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends, partially offset by the impact of a change in business mix due to an increase in longer-tail loss-sensitive business in national accounts.
the underwriting expense ratio of 32.0% in 2013 was 0.8 points lower than the 2012 underwriting expense ratio of 32.8%. the decrease in 2013 primarily reflected the impact of growth in earned premiums.

overview operating income in 2014 was $727 million, $154 million or 27% higher than operating income of $573 million in 2013, primarily reflecting the pretax impacts of (i) higher net favorable prior year reserve development and (ii) higher underlying underwriting margins, partially offset by (iii) lower net investment income. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 was $450 million and $232 million, respectively. catastrophe losses in 2014 and 2013 were $6 million and $8 million, respectively. the improvement in underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected the pretax impact of lower reinsurance costs. partially offsetting this net pretax increase in operating income was an increase in income tax expense. the higher effective tax rate in 2014 than in 2013 resulted from the impact of interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax income in 2014 than in 2013, as well as the impact of a $15 million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 due to the resolution of prior year tax matters.
operating income in 2013 was $573 million, $69 million or 14% higher than operating income of $504 million in 2012. the increase in operating income primarily reflected the pretax impact of (i) higher underlying underwriting margins and (ii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by (iii) lower net investment income. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 was $232 million and $180 million, respectively. catastrophe losses in 2013 and 2012 were $8 million and $15 million, respectively. the improvement in underlying underwriting margins was driven by (i) earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends, partially offset by (ii) higher general and administrative expenses and (iii) the impact of lower volumes of insured exposures. partially offsetting this net pretax increase in operating income was an increase in income tax expense. the lower effective tax rate in 2013 than in 2012 was primarily due to the resolution of prior year tax matters described above.

overview operating income in 2014 was $824 million, $14 million or 2% lower than operating income of $838 million in 2013. the decrease in operating income primarily reflected the pretax impacts of (i) an increase in catastrophe losses, (ii) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and (iii) a decline in other revenues, partially offset by (iv) higher underlying underwriting margins and (v) higher net investment income. catastrophe losses in 2014 and 2013 were $336 million and $250 million, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 was $169 million and $209 million, respectively. the improvement in underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected (i) earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and (ii) the benefit of the company's previously announced expense reduction initiatives, partially offset by (iii) the impact of a higher mix of new business versus renewal business. income tax expense in 2014 was level with 2013. the higher effective tax rate in 2014 than in 2013 primarily resulted from the impact of a $5 million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 due to the resolution of prior year tax matters.
96
operating income in 2013 was $838 million, $621 million higher than operating income of $217 million in 2012. the increase in operating income primarily reflected the pretax impact of (i) lower catastrophe losses, (ii) higher underlying underwriting margins, (iii) an increase in other revenues and (iv) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by (v) lower net investment income. catastrophe losses in 2013 and 2012 were $250 million and $1.02 billion, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 was $209 million and $175 million, respectively. the improvement in underlying underwriting margins resulted from the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses. partially offsetting this net pretax increase in operating income was an increase in income tax expense. the higher effective tax rate in 2013 than in 2012 primarily resulted from interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax income in 2013 than in 2012.
revenues earned premiums earned premiums in 2014 were $7.13 billion, $199 million or 3% lower than in 2013. earned premiums in 2013 were $7.32 billion, $297 million or 4% lower than in 2012. the declines in both years reflected reductions in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months.

claims and expenses claims and claim adjustment expenses claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2014 were $4.24 billion, $83 million or 2% lower than in 2013. the decrease primarily reflected (i) the impact of lower volumes of insured exposures and (ii) the benefit of the company's previously announced expense reduction initiatives on claim adjustment expenses, partially offset by (iii) higher catastrophe losses, (iv) the impact of loss cost trends and (v) lower net favorable prior year reserve development. factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2013 were $4.33 billion, $1.18 billion or 21% lower than in 2012. the decrease primarily reflected (i) lower catastrophe losses, (ii) the impact of lower volumes of insured exposures, (iii) lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses and (iv) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by (v) the impact of loss cost trends. factors

amortization of deferred acquisition costs amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2014 was $1.17 billion, $112 million or 9% lower than in 2013. the decrease in 2014 primarily reflected a decline in commission expense due to lower commission rates, as well as a decline in earned premiums compared with 2013. amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2013 was $1.29 billion, $152 million or 11% lower than in 2012. the decrease in 2013 reflected (i) the decline in earned premiums compared with 2012, (ii) a reclassification of fee income related to the national flood insurance program from general and administrative expenses to a component of acquisition costs to conform to the presentation prescribed by insurance regulators, and (iii) lower fixed-value commission expense due to an increase in the number of agents reverting to a contingent commission compensation program.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses in 2014 were $977 million, $3 million or less than 1% lower than in 2013. the decrease in 2014 primarily reflected the impact of the company's expense reduction initiatives, largely offset by higher contingent commission expenses and higher underwriting expenses resulting from higher new business levels. general and administrative expenses in 2013 were $980 million, $80 million or 9% higher than in 2012. the increase in 2013 included an increase in contingent commission expense due to an increase in the number of agents reverting from a fixed-value commission compensation program to a contingent commission compensation program and the impact of the reclassification of fee income described above. the increase in 2013 also included the impact of $12 million of restructuring charges, primarily comprised of severance costs related to the company's announced plan to reduce certain claim and other insurance expenses in this segment. these factors were partially offset by a decline in advertising expense.
income tax expense income tax expense in 2014 was $366 million, level with 2013, as the tax effect of the $14 million decrease in pre-tax operating income was offset by the impact of a $5 million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters. income tax expense in 2013 was $366 million, $334 million higher than in 2012, primarily reflecting the impacts of the $955 million increase in pre-tax operating income, partially offset by a reduction in income tax expense resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters in 2013.
combined ratio the combined ratio of 88.7% in 2014 was 0.2 points lower than the combined ratio of 88.9% in 2013.
the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 59.6% in 2014 was 0.5 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 59.1% in 2013. catastrophe losses in 2014 and 2013 accounted for 4.7 points and 3.4 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 provided 2.4 points and 2.8 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. the 2014 underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 1.2 points lower than the 2013 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting (i) earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and (ii) the benefit of the company's previously announced expense reduction initiatives, partially offset by (iii) the impact of a higher mix of new business versus renewal business.
98
the underwriting expense ratio of 29.1% in 2014 was 0.7 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 29.8% in 2013. the decrease in 2014 primarily reflected (i) lower homeowners' commission rates and (ii) the benefit of the company's expense reduction initiatives, partially offset by (iii) higher underwriting expenses resulting from higher new business levels and (iv) a decrease in earned premiums.
the combined ratio of 88.9% in 2013 was 13.0 points lower than the combined ratio of 101.9% in 2012.
the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 59.1% in 2013 was 13.2 points lower than the 2012 ratio of 72.3%. catastrophe losses in 2013 and 2012 accounted for 3.4 and 13.4 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 provided 2.8 points and 2.3 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, respectively. the 2013 underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 2.7 points lower than the 2012 ratio on the same basis, reflecting impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses.
the underwriting expense ratio of 29.8% in 2013 was 0.2 points higher than the underwriting expense ratio of 29.6% in 2012. the increase in 2013 primarily reflected the decrease in earned premiums and the expense factors discussed above.
agency written premiums gross and net written premiums by product line were as follows for the personal insurance segment's agency business, which comprises business written through agents, brokers and other intermediaries and represents almost all of the segment's gross and net written premiums:

agency automobile                     $3,278            $3,277            $3,544
agency homeowners and other                 3,800             4,094             4,220
total agency personal insurance       $7,078            $7,371            $7,764

agency automobile                     $3,260            $3,258            $3,527
agency homeowners and other                 3,718             3,805             3,909
total agency personal insurance       $6,978            $7,063            $7,436
in 2014, gross and net agency written premiums were 4% and 1% lower, respectively, than in 2013. the higher rate of decrease in gross written premiums in 2014 was primarily driven by the impact of the sale of the company's nfip business in 2013 described above. in 2013, gross and net agency written premiums were both 5% lower than in 2012. renewal rate changes exceeded expected loss cost trends in 2013 assuming weather patterns consistent with the company's expectations.
in 2014, net written premiums in the agency automobile line of business were slightly higher than in 2013. business retention rates remained strong in 2014 and were higher than in 2013. renewal premium changes in 2014 remained positive but were lower than in 2013, primarily due to lower renewal rate changes. new business premiums in 2014 were significantly higher than in 2013 as a result of the company's new private passenger automobile product, quantum auto 2.0. in 2013 in the agency automobile line of business, net written premiums were 8% lower than in 2012. business retention rates in 2013 remained strong but were lower than in 2012, while new business premiums in 2013 decreased from 2012. renewal premium changes in 2013 remained positive and were higher than in 2012, primarily driven by renewal rate changes.
99
in 2014, net written premiums in the agency homeowners and other line of business were 2% lower than 2013 as a result of ongoing underwriting actions taken in response to the severe weather events that have occurred over the last several years, including seeking improved rates where the company believes it is appropriate, as well as improved terms and conditions. business retention rates remained strong in 2014 and were higher than in 2013. renewal premium changes in 2014 remained positive but were lower than in 2013, primarily due to lower renewal rate changes. new business premiums in 2014 were higher than in 2013. in 2013 in the agency homeowners and other line of business, net written premiums were 3% lower than in 2012 as a result of the ongoing underwriting actions described above. business retention rates remained strong but were lower than in 2012. renewal premium changes in 2013 remained positive but were lower than in 2012. new business premiums in 2013 decreased from 2012.
for its agency business, the personal insurance segment had approximately 6.0 million and 6.2 million active policies at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
direct to consumer written premiums in its direct to consumer business, net written premiums in 2014 were $187 million, $25 million or 15% higher than in 2013. in 2014, automobile net written premiums increased by $18 million or 16% over 2013, and homeowners and other net written premiums increased by $7 million or 14% over 2013. net written premiums in 2013 were $162 million, $4 million or 3% higher than in 2012. in 2013, homeowners and other net written premiums increased by $7 million, or 16% over 2012, partially offset by a decline of $3 million, or 3%, in automobile net written premiums compared to 2012. the direct to consumer business had 193,000 and 166,000 active policies at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
interest expense and other

operating loss       $(257     )   $(248     )   $(261     )
the operating loss for interest expense and other in 2014 was $9 million higher than in 2013. the operating loss for interest expense and other in 2013 was $13 million lower than in 2012. after-tax interest expense in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $240 million, $235 million and $246 million, respectively. the increase in interest expense in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily reflected slightly higher average levels of debt outstanding. the decrease in interest expense in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily reflected lower average levels of debt outstanding.
asbestos claims and litigation the company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have expanded insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the original intent of insurers and policyholders. the company has received and continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims from the company's policyholders (which includes others seeking coverage under a policy). factors underlying these claim filings include continued intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the continued focus by plaintiffs on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation. the focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years. in addition to contributing to the overall number of claims, bankruptcy proceedings may increase the volatility of asbestos-related losses by initially delaying the reporting of claims and later by significantly accelerating and increasing loss payments by insurers, including the company. the bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those
100
policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but remain in the tort system. currently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation, contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payment patterns experienced by the company. the company's asbestos-related claims and claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers.
the company continues to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders, some of whom have filed for bankruptcy, who in some instances have asserted that all or a portion of their asbestos-related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. in these instances, policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated as a separate occurrence under the policy. it is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues. to the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder's favor and other company defenses are not successful, the company's coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per-occurrence limits and the number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders. although the company has seen a moderation in the overall risk associated with these lawsuits, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims.
many coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of settlement negotiations. settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the company but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated. there also may be instances where a court may not approve a proposed settlement, which may result in additional litigation and potentially less beneficial outcomes for the company. as in the past, the company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities.
in addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the company, by individuals challenging insurers' conduct with respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. travelers property casualty corp. (tpc) had previously entered into settlement agreements in connection with a number of these direct action claims (direct action settlements). the company had been involved in litigation concerning whether all of the conditions of the direct action settlements had been satisfied. on july 22, 2014, the united states court of appeals for the second circuit ruled that all of the conditions of the direct action settlements had been satisfied. on january 15, 2015, the bankruptcy court entered an order directing the company to pay $579 million to the plaintiffs, and the company has made that payment. for a full discussion of these settlement agreements and related litigation, see the "asbestos direct action litigation" section of note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements herein. it is possible that the filing of other direct actions against insurers, including the company, could be made in the future. it is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability. the company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions.
because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually. among the factors which the company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder's potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future
101
claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim.
in the third quarter of 2014, the company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review, including a review of active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and "non-product" liability, and noted the continuation of the following trends:
 continued high level of litigation activity in certain jurisdictions involving individuals alleging serious asbestos-related illness, primarily involving mesothelioma claims;
 while overall payment patterns have been generally stable, there has been an increase in severity for certain policyholders due to the continued high level of litigation activity; and
 continued moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity.
while the company believes that over the past several years there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the company's overall asbestos exposure, there nonetheless remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure from asbestos claims.
the home office and field office categories, which account for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos-related claims, experienced a slight increase in net asbestos-related payments in 2014 when compared with 2013. the number of policyholders with pending asbestos claims in these categories as of december 31, 2014 was essentially unchanged when compared with december 31, 2013. payments on behalf of policyholders in these categories continue to be influenced by the high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury continue to target defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation.
the company's quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. the company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders in the home office, field office and assumed reinsurance and other categories as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. in addition, the company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves nor have the company's evaluations resulted in any way of determining a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment.
the completion of these reviews and analyses in 2014, 2013 and 2012 resulted in $250 million, $190 million and $175 million increases, respectively, in the company's net asbestos reserves. in each year, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the company's estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of policyholders in the home office category due to a higher level of litigation activity surrounding mesothelioma claims than previously anticipated. in addition, the reserve increases in 2013 and 2012 also reflected higher projected payments on assumed reinsurance accounts. the increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs resulted from payment trends that continue to be higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the current litigation environment discussed above. notwithstanding these trends, the company's overall view of the underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims.
net asbestos paid loss and loss expenses in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $242 million, $218 million and $236 million, respectively. approximately 8%, 1% and 6% of total net paid losses in 2014, 2013
102
and 2012, respectively, related to policyholders with whom the company had entered into settlement agreements limiting the company's liability.
the company categorizes its asbestos reserves as follows:

policyholders with settlement agreements       17              15              $19           $3            $613              $108
home office and field office                       1,692           1,690       197           195                 1,574             2,047
assumed reinsurance and other                                                26            20            170               195
total                                              1,709           1,705       $242          $218          $2,357            $2,350
the "policyholders with settlement agreements" category includes structured settlements, coverage in place arrangements and, with respect to tpc, wellington accounts. reserves are based on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement. structured settlements are arrangements under which policyholders and/or plaintiffs agree to fixed financial amounts to be paid at scheduled times. coverage in place arrangements represent agreements with policyholders on specified amounts of coverage to be provided. payment obligations may be subject to annual maximums and are only made when valid claims are presented. wellington accounts refer to the 35 defendants that are parties to a 1985 agreement settling certain disputes concerning insurance coverage for their asbestos claims. many of the aspects of the wellington agreement are similar to those of coverage in place arrangements in which the parties have agreed on specific amounts of coverage and the terms under which the coverage can be accessed. as discussed above, on july 22, 2014, the united states court of appeals for the second circuit ruled that all the conditions of the direct action settlements had been satisfied. as a result, during the third quarter of 2014, $502 million of reserves included in the unallocated ibnr component in the "home office and field office" category were reclassified to the "policyholders with settlement agreements" category. for a full discussion of these settlement agreements, including the payment of this settlement and related interest in january 2015, see the "settlement of asbestos direct action litigation" section of note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
the "home office and field office" category relates to all other policyholders and also includes ibnr reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos-related coverage litigation. ibnr reserves in the "home office and field office" category include amounts for new claims from and adverse development on existing "home office and field office" policyholders, as well as reserves for claims from policyholders reporting asbestos claims for the first time and for policyholders for which there is, or may be, litigation. policyholders are identified for the annual home office review based upon, among other factors: a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure, number of reported claims, products/completed operations and potential "non-product" exposures, size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder. the "assumed reinsurance and other" category primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various pool participations.
on january 29, 2009, the company and ppg industries, inc ("ppg"), along with approximately 30 other insurers of ppg, agreed in principle to an agreement to settle asbestos-related coverage litigation under insurance policies issued to ppg. the tentative settlement agreement has been incorporated into the modified third amended plan of reorganization ("amended plan") proposed as part of the pittsburgh corning corp. ("pcc," which is 50% owned by ppg) bankruptcy proceeding. pursuant to the proposed amended plan, which was filed on january 30, 2009, pcc, along with enumerated other companies (including ppg as well as the company as a participating insurer), are to receive protections
103
afforded by section 524(g) of the bankruptcy code from certain asbestos-related bodily injury claims. under the agreement in principle, the company has the option to make a series of payments over the next 20 years totaling approximately $620 million to the trust to be created under the amended plan, or it may elect to make a one-time discounted payment, which, as of march 31, 2015, would total approximately $505 million (approximately $476 million after reinsurance). the agreement in principle with ppg is subject to numerous contingencies, including final court approval of the amended plan, and the company has no obligation to make the settlement payment until all contingencies are satisfied. the company's obligations under this agreement in principle are included in the "home office and field office" category in the preceding table.

see "uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves."
environmental claims and litigation the company has received and continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances. mostly, these claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. for instance, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. this federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. liability under cercla may be joint and several with other responsible parties.
104
the company has been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. the company believes that some court decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. these decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the company prior to the mid-1980s. these decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. environmental claims, when submitted, rarely indicate the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the policyholder, and the company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount.
the resolution of environmental exposures by the company generally occurs through settlements with policyholders as opposed to claimants. generally, the company strives to extinguish any obligations it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past, present and future environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder. this form of settlement is commonly referred to as a "buy-back" of policies for future environmental liability. in addition, many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance obligation which the company may have for other claims, including but not limited to asbestos and other cumulative injury claims. the company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which extinguish any liability arising from known specified sites or claims. where appropriate, these agreements also include indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the company. the company's general purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce the company's potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related costs.
in establishing environmental reserves, the company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. in the course of this analysis, the company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage and relevant judicial interpretations. in addition, the company considers the many variables presented, such as: the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. the evaluation of the exposure presented by a policyholder can change as information concerning that policyholder and the many variables presented is developed. conventional actuarial techniques are not used to estimate these reserves.
in its review of environmental reserves, the company considers: past settlement payments; changing judicial and legislative trends; its reserves for the costs of litigating environmental coverage matters; the potential for policyholders with smaller exposures to be named in new clean-up actions for both on- and off-site waste disposal activities; the potential for adverse development; the potential for additional new claims beyond previous expectations; and the potential higher costs for new settlements.
the duration of the company's investigation and review of these claims and the extent of time necessary to determine an appropriate estimate, if any, of the value of the claim to the company vary significantly and are dependent upon a number of factors. these factors include, but are not limited to, the cooperation of the policyholder in providing claim information, the pace of underlying litigation or claim processes, the pace of coverage litigation between the policyholder and the company and the willingness of the policyholder and the company to negotiate, if appropriate, a resolution of any dispute pertaining to these claims. because these factors vary from claim-to-claim and policyholder-by-policyholder, the company cannot provide a meaningful average of the duration of an environmental claim. however, based upon the company's experience in resolving these claims, the duration may vary from months to several years.

the company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time, frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980's. these policyholders continue to present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants. further, in many instances, clean-up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk-based site analyses and more efficient clean-up technologies. over the past several years, the company has experienced generally favorable trends in the number of new policyholders tendering environmental claims for the first time and in the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters. however, the degree to which those favorable trends have continued has been less than anticipated. in addition, reserve development on existing environmental claims has been greater than anticipated. as a result of these factors, in 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company increased its net environmental reserves by $87 million, $65 million and $90 million, respectively.
net environmental paid loss and loss expenses were $84 million in each of the years 2014, 2013 and 2012. at december 31, 2014, approximately 92% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $318 million) was carried in a bulk reserve and included unresolved environmental claims, incurred but not reported environmental claims and the anticipated cost of coverage litigation disputes relating to these claims. the bulk reserve the company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in-process environmental claims and the company's experience in resolving those claims. the balance, approximately 8% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $28 million), consists of case reserves.

uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves as a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management's judgment. however, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. as a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. the continuing uncertainties include, without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation, any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or decrease in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated, the emergence of a greater number of asbestos claims than anticipated as a result of extended life expectancies resulting from medical advances and lifestyle improvements, the role of any umbrella or excess policies the company has issued, the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with the company's previous assessment of these claims, the number and outcome of direct actions against the company, future developments pertaining to the company's ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims and the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers. in addition, uncertainties arise from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders and other defendants. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. this environment could be affected by changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims. it is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. this is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. as part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the company continues to study the implications of these and other developments.
because of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the company's current reserves. in addition, the company's estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the company's operating results in future periods.
investment portfolio the company's invested assets at december 31, 2014 were $73.26 billion, of which 93% was invested in fixed maturity and short-term investments, 1% in equity securities, 1% in real estate investments and 5% in other investments. because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments, the company employs a conservative investment philosophy. a significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid, taxable u.s. government, tax-exempt u.s. municipal and taxable corporate and u.s. agency mortgage-backed bonds.

rated using external rating agencies or by the company when a public rating does not exist. ratings shown are the higher of the rating of the underlying issuer or the insurer in the case of securities enhanced by third-party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of issuer default.
the company bases its investment decision on the underlying credit characteristics of the municipal security. while its municipal bond portfolio includes a number of securities that were enhanced by third-party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default, the company does not rely on enhanced credit characteristics provided by such third-party insurance as part of its investing decisions. of the insured municipal securities in the company's investment portfolio at december 31, 2014, approximately 100% were rated at "a3" or above, and approximately 88% were rated at "aa3" or above, without the benefit of insurance. the company believes that a loss of the benefit of insurance would not result in a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the underlying credit strength of the issuers of the securities, as well as the company's ability and intent to hold the securities. the average credit rating of the underlying issuers of these securities was "aa2" at december 31, 2014. the average credit rating of the entire municipal bond portfolio was "aa1" at december 31, 2014, with and without the enhancement provided by third-party insurance.

rated using external rating agencies or by the company when a public rating does not exist. the table includes $554 million of short-term securities which have the highest ratings issued by external rating agencies for short-term issuances. for purposes of this table, the short-term securities, which are rated "a-1+" and/or "p-1," are included as "aaa" rated securities.
in addition to fixed maturities noted in the foregoing table, the company has exposure totaling $214 million to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships (both of which are included in other investments in the company's consolidated balance sheet) whose primary investing focus is across europe. the company has unfunded commitments totaling $136 million to these partnerships. the company also has $5 million of nonredeemable preferred stock (included in equity securities on the company's consolidated balance sheet) issued by companies in the eurozone.
mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through securities the company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at december 31, 2014 and 2013 included $2.21 billion and $2.42 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through-securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (cmo), all of which are subject to prepayment risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration). while prepayment risk for securities and its effect on income cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the company's investment strategy generally favors securities that reduce this risk within expected interest rate ranges. included in the totals at december 31, 2014 and 2013 were $872 million and $1.07 billion, respectively, of gnma, fnma, fhlmc (excluding fha project loans) and canadian government guaranteed residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities classified as available for sale. also included in those totals were residential cmos classified as available for sale with a fair value of $1.34 billion and $1.36 billion at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. approximately 46% and 42% of the company's cmo holdings at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were
113
guaranteed by or fully collateralized by securities issued by gnma, fnma or fhlmc. the average credit rating of the $725 million and $790 million of non-guaranteed cmo holdings at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, was "ba1" and "ba3," respectively. the average credit rating of all of the above securities was "aa3" and "a1" at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the company makes investments in residential cmos that are either guaranteed by gnma, fnma or fhlmc, or if not guaranteed, are senior or super-senior positions within their respective securitizations. both guaranteed and non-guaranteed residential cmos allocate the distribution of payments from the underlying mortgages among different classes of bondholders. in addition, non-guaranteed residential cmos provide structures that allocate the impact of credit losses to different classes of bondholders. senior and super-senior cmos are protected, to varying degrees, from credit losses as those losses are initially allocated to subordinated bondholders. the company's investment strategy is to purchase cmo tranches that are expected to offer the most favorable return given the company's assessment of associated risks. the company does not purchase residual interests in cmos.
alternative documentation mortgages and sub-prime mortgages at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the company's fixed maturity investment portfolio included cmos backed by alternative documentation mortgages and asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages with a collective fair value of $252 million and $293 million, respectively (comprising less than 1% of the company's total fixed maturity investments at both dates). the company defines sub-prime mortgage-backed securities as investments in which the underlying loans primarily exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: low fico scores, above-prime interest rates, high loan-to-value ratios or high debt-to-income ratios. alternative documentation securitizations are those in which the underlying loans primarily meet the government-sponsored entities' requirements for credit score but do not meet the government-sponsored entities' guidelines for documentation, property type, debt and loan-to-value ratios. the average credit rating on these securities and obligations held by the company was"ba2" at both december 31, 2014 and 2013. the company does not believe this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the portfolio's relatively small size.
commercial mortgage-backed securities and project loans at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the company held commercial mortgage-backed securities (including fha project loans) of $715 million and $475 million, respectively. the average credit rating on these securities held by the company was "aaa" at both december 31, 2014 and 2013. the company does not believe this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the portfolio's relatively small size and the underlying credit strength of these securities.
equity securities available for sale, real estate and short-term investments see note 1 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for further information about these invested asset classes.
other investments the company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships and joint ventures. these asset classes have historically provided a higher return than the company's fixed maturity investments but are subject to more volatility. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the carrying value of the company's other investments was $3.59 billion and $3.44 billion, respectively.
114
securities lending the company has engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of its investments to other institutions for short periods of time. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the company had $296 million and $131 million of securities on loan, respectively, as part of a tri-party lending agreement. the average monthly balance of securities on loan during 2014 and 2013 was $228 million and $168 million, respectively. borrowers of these securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest. the company has not incurred any investment losses in its securities lending program for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
lloyd's trust deposit the company utilizes a lloyd's trust deposit, whereby owned securities with a fair value of approximately $151 million and $181 million held by a wholly-owned subsidiary at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were pledged into a lloyd's trust account to provide a portion of the capital needed to support the company's obligations at lloyd's.
net unrealized investment gains the net unrealized investment gains that were included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income were as follows:

net unrealized investment gains at end of year       $1,966                 $1,322       $3,103
net unrealized investment gains at december 31, 2014 increased over the prior year-end, primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in market interest rates during 2014. net unrealized investment gains at december 31, 2013 declined from the prior year-end, primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in market interest rates during 2013.
the following table summarizes, for all fixed maturities and equity securities reported at fair value for which fair value is less than 80% of amortized cost at december 31, 2014, the gross unrealized investment loss by length of time those securities have continuously been in an unrealized loss position of greater than 20% of amortized cost:

these unrealized investment losses at december 31, 2014 represent less than 1% of the combined fixed maturity and equity security portfolios on a pretax basis and less than 1% of shareholders' equity on an after-tax basis.
for fixed maturity investments where fair value is less than the carrying value and the company did not reach a decision to impair, the company continues to have the intent and ability to hold such investments to a projected recovery in value, which may not be until maturity.
at both december 31, 2014 and 2013, below investment grade securities comprised 3.0% of the company's fixed maturity investment portfolio. included in below investment grade securities at december 31, 2014 were securities in an unrealized loss position that, in the aggregate, had an amortized cost of $645 million and a fair value of $619 million, resulting in a net pretax unrealized investment loss of $26 million. these securities in an unrealized loss position represented approximately 1% of both the total amortized cost and the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio at december 31, 2014 and accounted for 22.0% of the total gross pretax unrealized investment loss in the fixed maturity portfolio at december 31, 2014.

catastrophe modeling the company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes, to analyze catastrophic events and the risks associated with them. the company uses these analyses and methods to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events. there are no industry-standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting catastrophe exposure. accordingly, catastrophe estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable.
the company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models and, when necessary, calibrates the catastrophe risk model estimates delivered via its own proprietary modeling processes. the company considers historical loss experience, recent events, underwriting practices, market share analyses, external scientific analysis and various other factors to account for non-modeled losses to refine its proprietary view of catastrophe risk. these proprietary models are continually updated as new information emerges.
the tables below set forth the probabilities that estimated losses, comprising claims and allocated claim adjustment expenses (but excluding unallocated claim adjustment expenses), from a single event occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts (expressed in dollars and as a percentage of the company's common equity), based on the current version of the proprietary and third-party computer models utilized by the company at december 31, 2014. for example, on the basis described below the tables, the company estimates that there is a one percent chance that the company's loss from a single u.s. hurricane in a one-year timeframe would equal or exceed $1.3 billion, or 6% of the company's common equity at december 31, 2014.

2.0% (1-in-50)      $1.0      $0.5
1.0% (1-in-100)      $1.3      $0.6
0.4% (1-in-250)      $1.9      $0.9
0.1% (1-in-1,000)      $3.6      $1.5

2.0% (1-in-50)       5   %     2   %
1.0% (1-in-100)       6   %     2   %
0.4% (1-in-250)       8   %     4   %
0.1% (1-in-1,000)      16   %     7   %
(1)
an event that has, for example, a 2% likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a "1-in-50 year event." as noted above, however, the probabilities in the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold loss amount in a one-year timeframe, not over a multi-year timeframe. also, because the probabilities relate to a single event, the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular period, and, therefore, the amounts do not address potential aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one-year timeframe.
117
(2)
the percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing (a) indicated loss amounts in dollars by (b) total common equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of taxes. net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. accordingly, the company's management uses the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis as a metric to evaluate the potential impact of a single hurricane or single earthquake on the company's financial position for purposes of making underwriting and reinsurance decisions.
the threshold loss amounts in the tables above, which are based on the company's in-force portfolio at december 31, 2014 and catastrophic reinsurance program at january 1, 2015, are net of reinsurance, after-tax and exclude unallocated claim adjustment expenses, which historically have been less than 10% of loss estimates. for further information regarding the company's reinsurance, see "item 1reinsurance." the amounts for hurricanes reflect u.s. exposures and include property exposures, property residual market exposures and an adjustment for certain non-property exposures. the hurricane loss amounts are based on the company's catastrophe risk model estimates and include losses from the hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge. the amounts for earthquakes reflect u.s. and canadian property and workers' compensation exposures. the company does not believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or other exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts.
catastrophe modeling relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history. these inputs reflect a significant amount of judgment and are subject to changes which may result in volatility in the modeled output. catastrophe modeling output may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseeable. catastrophe modeling assumptions include, among others, the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event, which may prove to be materially incorrect. consequently, catastrophe modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. in the tables above, the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of exceedance decreases. in other words, in the case of a relatively more remote event (e.g., 1-in-1,000), the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable. actual losses from an event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount. in addition, more than one such event could occur in any period.
moreover, the company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers' compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes, and it is exposed to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes, such as tornadoes and other windstorms, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares, as well as acts of terrorism and cyber-risk.
for more information about the company's exposure to catastrophe losses, see "item 1arisk factorscatastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance" and "item 1arisk factorswe may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results."
changing climate conditions severe weather events over the last several years have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends and created uncertainty regarding insurers' exposures to financial loss as a result of catastrophes and other weather-related events. for example, over the last decade hurricane activity has impacted areas further inland than previously experienced by the company, thus expanding the company's potential for losses from hurricanes. additionally, both the frequency and severity of tornado and hail storms in the united states have been more volatile in recent years, while any further
118
reductions in arctic sea ice may contribute to rising sea levels that could impact flooding in coastal areas. accordingly, the company may be subject to increased losses from catastrophes and other weather-related events. additionally, the company's catastrophe models may be less reliable due to the increased unpredictability, frequency and severity of severe weather events or a delay in the recognition of recent changes in climate conditions.
the company discusses how potentially changing climate conditions may present other issues for its business under "risk factors" in item 1a of this report and under "outlook" herein. for example, among other things:
 increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in increased frequency and severity of claims under policies issued by the company. see "risk factorscatastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance" and "outlookunderwriting gain/loss."
 changing climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of securities in which the company invests. for example, water supply adequacy could impact the creditworthiness of bond issuers in the southwestern united states, and more frequent and/or severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of issuers in the southeastern united states, among other areas. see "risk factorsour investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses."
 increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact the company and its customers. for example, state insurance regulation could impact the company's ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses. if the company is unable to implement risk based pricing, modify policy terms or reduce exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller scale weather events (should those increased losses occur), its business may be adversely affected. see "risk factorscatastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance."
 the full range of potential liability exposures related to climate change continues to evolve. through the company's emerging issues committee and its committee on climate, energy and the environment, the company works with its business units and corporate groups, as appropriate, to identify and try to assess climate change-related liability issues, which are continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate. see "risk factorsthe effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain."
climate change regulation also could increase the company's customers' costs of doing business. for example, insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may, over time, increase loss exposures. also, increased regulation may result in reduced economic activity, which would decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses.
the company regularly reviews emerging issues, such as changing climate conditions, to consider potential changes to its modeling and the use of such modeling, as well as to help determine the need for new underwriting strategies, coverage modifications or new products.
reinsurance recoverables the company reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to control its exposure to losses. for additional discussion regarding the company's reinsurance coverage, see "part iitem 1reinsurance."

the $401 million decline in net reinsurance recoverables from december 31, 2013 primarily reflected the impact of (i) net favorable prior year reserve development, (ii) cash collections, (iii) commutation agreements, as well as (iv) a slightly lower level of reinsurance purchased in 2014.
the following table presents the company's top five reinsurer groups by reinsurance recoverable at december 31, 2014 (in millions). also included is the a.m. best rating of each reinsurer group at february 12, 2015:

on january 9, 2015, xl capital group announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire catlin group limited. additionally, a.m. best has placed xl capital group's ratings under review with negative implications.
on january 25, 2015, axis capital holdings limited and partnerre ltd. announced that they had signed a definitive amalgamation agreement. the company's aggregated reinsurance recoverables from these entities at december 31, 2014 totaled approximately $236 million. the a.m. best ratings for each entity at february 12, 2015 was "a+" (second highest of 16 ratings). a.m. best has placed the ratings of each entity under review with negative implications.
at december 31, 2014, the company held $1.17 billion of collateral in the form of letters of credit, funds and trust agreements held to fully or partially collateralize certain reinsurance recoverables.
for a discussion of a pending reinsurance dispute pertaining to a portion of the company's reinsurance recoverable from the munich re group in the foregoing table, see note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
included in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to structured settlements, which are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. in cases where the company did not receive a release from the claimant, the amount due from the life insurance company related to the structured settlement is included in the company's consolidated balance sheet as a reinsurance recoverable and the related claim cost is included in the liability for claims and claim
120
adjustment expense reserves, as the company retains the contingent liability to the claimant. if it is expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, the company would recognize an impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations. in the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, the company would be required to make such payments. the following table presents the company's top five groups by structured settlements at december 31, 2014 (in millions). also included is the a.m. best rating of the company's predominant insurer from each insurer group at february 12, 2015:

fidelity &amp; guaranty life group      $938   b++   fifth highest of 16 ratings metlife group                            439   a+    second highest of 16 ratings genworth financial group(1)              414   a     third highest of 16 ratings john hancock group                       259   a+    second highest of 16 ratings symetra financial corporation            238   a     third highest of 16 ratings

a.m. best has placed the ratings of genworth financial group under review with negative implications.
the company considers the ratings and related outlook assigned to reinsurance companies and life insurance companies by various independent ratings agencies in assessing the adequacy of its allowance for uncollectible amounts.
outlook the following discussion provides outlook information for certain key drivers of the company's results of operations and capital position.
premiums.    the company's earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume. net written premiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the life of the underlying policies. when business renews, the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease (renewal premium change) as a result of increases or decreases in rate and/or insured exposures, which the company considers as a measure of units of exposure (such as the number and value of vehicles or properties insured). net written premiums from both renewal and new business, and therefore earned premiums, are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions, which, particularly in the case of the business and international insurance segment, affect audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations. net written premiums are also impacted by the structure of reinsurance programs and related costs.
overall, the company expects retention levels (the amount of expiring premium that renews, before the impact of renewal premium changes) will remain strong. in the business and international insurance segment, the company expects that renewal premium changes during 2015 will remain positive, driven by both positive renewal rate changes and, subject to the economic uncertainties discussed below, growth in insured exposures, but will be lower than the levels attained in 2014. in the bond & specialty insurance segment, the company expects that renewal premium changes during 2015 will be broadly consistent with 2014. with respect to surety, the company expects net written premium volume in 2015 that is broadly consistent with the levels attained in 2014. in the personal insurance segment, the company expects both agency automobile and agency homeowners and other renewal premium changes during 2015 will remain positive, driven by both positive renewal rate changes (based on the company's actions to file for rate increases) and, subject to the economic uncertainties discussed below, growth in insured exposures, but will be lower than the levels attained in 2014. the
121
need for state regulatory approval for changes to personal property and casualty insurance prices, as well as competitive market conditions, may impact the timing and extent of renewal premium changes.
property and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive during 2015 for new business, not only in business and international insurance and bond & specialty insurance, but especially in personal insurance, where price comparison technology used by agents and brokers, sometimes referred to as "comparative raters," has facilitated the process of generating multiple quotes, thereby increasing price comparison on new business and, increasingly, on renewal business. the company anticipates that its new quantum auto 2.0 product in the personal insurance segment's agency automobile line of business, as discussed below, will continue to increase new business premiums during 2015. the company also anticipates that, as a result of strong business retentions and increases in new business, policies in force in the personal insurance segment's agency automobile line of business will continue to increase in 2015. in each of the company's business segments, new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal business. however, in periods of meaningful increases in new business, the impact of a higher mix of new business versus renewal business may negatively impact underwriting profitability.
in recent years, the federal government, particularly the federal reserve, has taken extraordinary steps to stabilize financial markets, encourage economic growth and keep interest rates low. during this time, the united states has experienced a slow rate of economic growth. even if economic growth continues in the united states, or other regions in which we do business, it may be at a slow or slower rate for an extended period of time. further, general uncertainty regarding a variety of domestic and international matters, such as the u.s. federal budget and taxes, implementation of the affordable care act, the regulatory environment and geopolitical instability in various parts of the world, has added to the uncertainty regarding economic conditions generally. if economic conditions deteriorate, the resulting low levels of economic activity could impact exposure changes at renewal and the company's ability to write business at acceptable rates. additionally, low levels of economic activity could adversely impact audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations after policies are written. all of the foregoing, in turn, could adversely impact net written premiums during 2015, and because earned premiums are a function of net written premiums, earned premiums could be adversely impacted in 2015.
underwriting gain/loss.    the company's underwriting gain/loss can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and net favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development, as well as underlying underwriting margins.
catastrophe and other weather-related losses are inherently unpredictable from period to period. the company experienced significant catastrophe and other weather-related losses in a number of recent periods, which adversely impacted its results of operations. the company's results of operations could be adversely impacted if significant catastrophe and other weather-related losses were to occur during 2015.
for the last several years, the company's results have included significant amounts of net favorable prior year reserve development, although at lower levels in some recent periods, driven by better than expected loss experience in all of the company's segments. the lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development in a number of recent periods may have been in part due to the company's reserve estimation process incorporating those factors that led to the higher levels of net favorable prior year reserve development in previous years. if that trend continues, the better than expected loss experience may continue at these recent lower levels, or even lower levels. however, given the inherent uncertainty in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, loss experience could develop such that the company recognizes higher or lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development, no favorable prior year reserve development or unfavorable prior year reserve development in future periods. in addition, the ongoing review of prior year claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or
122
other changes in current period circumstances, may result in the company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods of the current year.
it is possible that the steps taken by the federal government, particularly the federal reserve, to stabilize financial markets and improve economic conditions could lead to higher inflation than the company had anticipated, which could in turn lead to an increase in the company's loss costs. the impact of inflation on loss costs could be more pronounced for those lines of business that are considered "long tail", such as general liability, as they require a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year. for a further discussion, see "part iitem 1arisk factorsif actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected."
in business and international insurance, the company expects underlying underwriting margins during 2015 that will be modestly higher than in 2014. in making this comparison, the company has assumed that non-catastrophe weather-related losses and what the company defines as large losses will be at lower levels than what the company experienced in 2014, particularly in the second half of that year.
in bond & specialty insurance, the company expects underlying underwriting margins during 2015 that will be broadly consistent with those in 2014.
in personal insurance, the company anticipates underlying underwriting margins in 2015 will be lower than in 2014. in agency automobile, the company expects underlying underwriting margins in 2015 that will be slightly lower than in 2014 due to the impact of an expected higher mix of new business versus renewal business. in agency homeowners and other, the company anticipates underlying underwriting margins in 2015 that will be lower than in 2014, reflecting normalized levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses. also in personal insurance, the company's direct to consumer initiative, the distribution channel that the company launched in 2009, while intended to enhance the company's long-term ability to compete successfully in a consumer-driven marketplace, is expected to remain modest with respect to premium volume and remain unprofitable for a number of years as this book of business grows and matures.
the agency automobile line of business has been negatively impacted by various factors, including the use of price comparison technology by agents and brokers as discussed above. the company's actions in response to these factors have included, among other things, the reduction of certain claim adjustment and other insurance expenses, with the majority of the impact in the agency automobile line of business. at december 31, 2014, these actions to reduce costs have resulted in an expected annual decrease of $140 million in pre-tax expenses in 2015 when compared with expense levels prior to their implementation. additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2013, the company launched its newest private passenger automobile product, quantum auto 2.0. this product, in addition to incorporating the cost savings described above, has a lower base commission rate than the company's existing quantum auto 1.0 product. these changes in cost structure enabled the company to price quantum auto 2.0 more competitively while maintaining expected returns at appropriate levels. by december 31, 2014, the company offered quantum auto 2.0 in approximately 90% of the states where it plans to offer the product, and the company currently expects that, by the end of 2015, it will offer the product in all of those states. the company intends that, in approved states, all new accounts will be written using quantum auto 2.0. in addition, quantum auto 2.0 is available to agents at their discretion for existing accounts.
investment portfolio.    the company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio and a relatively short average effective duration. the average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 3.5 (3.7 excluding short-term securities) at december 31, 2014. from time to time, the company enters into short positions in
123
u.s. treasury futures contracts to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio. at december 31, 2014, the company had $350 million notional value of open u.s. treasury futures contracts. the company continually evaluates its investment alternatives and mix. currently, the majority of the company's investments are comprised of a widely diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid taxable u.s. government, tax-exempt u.s. municipal and taxable corporate and u.s. agency mortgage-backed bonds.
the company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships and joint ventures. these investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also the potential for higher degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity.
net investment income is a material contributor to the company's results of operations. interest rates remain at very low levels by historical standards. based on the current interest rate environment, the company estimates that the impact of lower reinvestment yields on the company's fixed maturity portfolio could, for 2015, result in approximately $25 million of lower after-tax net investment income from that portfolio on a quarterly basis as compared to the corresponding quarters of 2014. given recent general economic and investment market conditions, the company expects investment income from the non-fixed maturity portfolio during 2015 will be lower than in 2014. if general economic conditions and/or investment market conditions deteriorate during 2015, the company could also experience a further reduction in net investment income and/or significant realized investment losses, including impairments.
the company had a net pre-tax unrealized investment gain of $2.67 billion ($1.75 billion after-tax) in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at december 31, 2014. while the company does not attempt to predict future interest rate movements, a rising interest rate environment would reduce the market value of fixed maturity investments and, therefore, reduce shareholders' equity, and a declining interest rate environment would have the opposite effects.

capital position.    the company believes it has a strong capital position and, as part of its ongoing efforts to create shareholder value, expects to continue to return capital not needed to support its business operations to its shareholders. the company expects that, generally over time, the combination of dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases will likely not exceed operating income. in addition, the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of additional factors, including the company's financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the company's desired ratings from independent rating agencies, funding of the company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions and other factors. for information regarding the company's common share repurchases in 2014, see "liquidity and capital resources."

many of the statements in this "outlook" section are forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond the company's control. actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. further, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report and the company undertakes no obligation to update them. see "forward-looking statements." for a discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could impact the company's results of operations or financial position, see "item 1arisk factors" and "item 7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting estimates."
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations and to satisfy general corporate purposes when needed.
operating company liquidity.    the liquidity requirements of the company's insurance subsidiaries are met primarily by funds generated from premiums, fees, income received on investments and investment maturities. cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims and claim adjustment expense payments and operating expenses. the insurance subsidiaries' liquidity requirements can be impacted by, among other factors, the timing and amount of catastrophe claims, which are inherently unpredictable, as well as the timing and amount of reinsurance recoveries, which may be affected by reinsurer solvency and reinsurance coverage disputes. additionally, the variability of asbestos-related claim payments, as well as the volatility of potential judgments and settlements arising out of litigation, may also result in increased liquidity requirements. it is the opinion of the company's management that the insurance subsidiaries' future liquidity needs will be adequately met from all of the sources described above. subject to restrictions imposed by states in which the company's insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, the company's principal insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to their respective parent companies, which in turn pay dividends to the corporate holding (parent) company (trv). for further information regarding restrictions on dividends paid by the company's insurance subsidiaries, see "part iitem 1regulation."
holding company liquidity.    trv's liquidity requirements primarily include shareholder dividends, debt servicing, common share repurchases and, from time to time, contributions to its qualified domestic pension plan. at december 31, 2014, trv held total cash and short-term invested assets in the united states aggregating $1.59 billion and having a weighted average maturity of 56 days. these assets are sufficient to meet trv's current liquidity requirements and are in excess of trv's minimum target level, which comprises trv's estimated annual pretax interest expense and common shareholder dividends, and currently totals approximately $1.1 billion.
trv is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. u.s. income taxes have not been recognized on $647 million of the company's foreign operations' undistributed earnings as of december 31, 2014, as such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations. furthermore, taxes paid to foreign governments on these earnings may be used as credits against the u.s. tax on dividend distributions if such earnings were to be distributed to the holding company. the amount of undistributed earnings from foreign operations and related taxes on those undistributed earnings were not material to the company's financial position or liquidity at december 31, 2014.
trv has a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission which permits it to issue securities from time to time. trv also has a $1.0 billion line of credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in june 2018. this line of credit also supports trv's $800 million commercial paper program, of which $100 million was outstanding at december 31, 2014. trv is not reliant on its commercial paper program to meet its operating cash flow needs.
125
the company utilized uncollateralized letters of credit issued by major banks with an aggregate limit of approximately $118 million, to provide a portion of the capital needed to support its obligations at lloyd's at december 31, 2014. if uncollateralized letters of credit are not available at a reasonable price or at all in the future, the company can collateralize these letters of credit or may have to seek alternative means of supporting its obligations at lloyd's, which could include utilizing holding company funds on hand.
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were $3.69 billion, $3.82 billion and $3.23 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. cash flows in 2014 primarily reflected higher levels of payments for claims and claim adjustment expenses, general and administrative expenses and commission expenses, as well as higher income tax payments, partially offset by higher levels of collected premiums. these increases included the impact of the company's acquisition of dominion. cash flows in 2013 primarily reflected a decrease in losses paid related to catastrophes and a higher level of collected premiums, partially offset by an increase in income tax payments. cash flows in 2012 primarily reflected a decrease in losses paid related to catastrophes, a lower level of paid losses related to asbestos claims and operations in runoff and a higher level of collected premiums, partially offset by an increase in paid losses related to non-catastrophe ongoing business (including the impact of increased loss costs). in 2014 and 2012, the company voluntarily made contributions totaling $200 million and $217 million, respectively, to its qualified domestic pension plan. in 2013, the company made no contributions to its qualified domestic pension plan. the qualified domestic pension plan was 96% and 106% funded at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
investing activities net cash flows provided by investing activities in 2014 were $206 million, compared with net cash flows used in investing activities of $910 million and $972 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. the 2013 total included $997 million related to the company's acquisition of dominion (net of cash acquired). the company's consolidated total investments at december 31, 2014 increased by $101 million, or less than 1% over year-end 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of net cash flows provided by operating activities and an increase in net unrealized appreciation of investments, largely offset by common share repurchases and dividends paid to shareholders. the company's consolidated total investments at december 31, 2013 decreased by $678 million, or 1% over year-end 2012, primarily reflecting the impact of a significant decline in net unrealized appreciation of investments driven by an increase in interest rates, common share repurchases and dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by net cash flows provided by operating activities and the acquisition of dominion.
on december 5, 2012, the company increased its ownership in j. malucelli participações em seguros e resseguros s.a, its brazilian joint venture (jmalucelli), through the exercise of a pre-existing option. as a result, the company increased its ownership to 49.5% of the venture. jmalucelli is currently the market leader in surety in brazil based on market share. the company's investment was funded with cash provided internally from an operating subsidiary of the company.
the company's investment portfolio is managed to support its insurance operations; accordingly, the portfolio is positioned to meet obligations to policyholders. as such, the primary goals of the company's asset-liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows. generally, the expected principal and interest payments produced by the company's fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the company's insurance reserves. although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period, the substantial amount by which the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds, contributes to the company's ability to fund claim payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities.
126
financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities were $3.81 billion, $2.94 billion and $2.15 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the totals in each year primarily reflected common share repurchases and dividends to shareholders, partially offset by the proceeds from employee stock option exercises. the total in 2013 also included the issuance of 4.60% senior notes for net proceeds of $494 million and the payment of the company's $500 million, 5.00% senior notes at maturity. common share repurchases in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $3.33 billion, $2.46 billion and $1.53 billion, respectively.
debt transactions.
2013.    on july 25, 2013, the company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.60% senior notes that will mature on august 1, 2043. the net proceeds of the issuance, after original issuance discount and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses, totaled approximately $494 million. interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on february 1 and august 1, commencing on february 1, 2014. the senior notes are redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the company's option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of senior notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current treasury rate (as defined) plus 15 basis points.
on march 15, 2013, the company's $500 million, 5.00% senior notes matured and were fully paid.
2012.    on may 29, 2012, the company purchased and retired $8.5 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated debentures due march 15, 2067 in an open market transaction. the company's $250 million, 5.375% senior notes matured on june 15, 2012 and were paid from existing holding company liquidity.
in 2015, the amount of debt obligations, other than commercial paper, that comes due is $400 million. the company may refinance maturing debt through funds generated internally or, depending on market conditions, through funds generated externally, including as a result of the issuance of debt or other securities.
dividends.    dividends paid to shareholders were $729 million, $729 million and $694 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the company's common stock will be at the discretion of the company's board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including the company's financial position, earnings, capital requirements of the company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors as the board of directors deems relevant. dividends will be paid by the company only if declared by its board of directors out of funds legally available, subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the company. on january 22, 2015, the company announced that it declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, payable march 31, 2015, to shareholders of record on march 10, 2015.
share repurchases.    the company's board of directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of rule 10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934, in private transactions or otherwise. the authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the company's financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the company's desired ratings from independent rating agencies, funding of the company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and
127
acquisitions and related financings), market conditions and other factors. the following table summarizes repurchase activity in 2014 and remaining repurchase capacity at december 31, 2014.

march 31, 2014           7.8           $650              $82.97          $4,109

from the inception of the first authorization on may 2, 2006 through december 31, 2014, the company has repurchased a cumulative total of 425.9 million shares for a total cost of $24.52 billion, or an average of $57.56 per share.
in 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company acquired 0.7 million, 0.8 million and 0.9 million shares, respectively, of common stock from employees as treasury stock primarily to cover payroll withholding taxes related to the vesting of restricted stock awards and exercises of stock options.
2014 stock incentive plan.    in february 2014, the company's board of directors approved the travelers companies, inc. 2014 stock incentive plan (the 2014 incentive plan) to replace, effective with shareholder approval, the amended and restated 2004 stock incentive plan (the 2004 incentive plan), which was scheduled to expire in july 2014. at the company's 2014 annual meeting of shareholders on may 27, 2014, the shareholders approved the 2014 incentive plan. accordingly, the 2014 incentive plan became effective on that date, and no further awards will be made under the 2004 incentive plan. the 2014 incentive plan has substantially the same terms, other than the number of shares available, as the 2004 incentive plan and is effective through february 5, 2024. the number of shares initially available for issuance under the 2014 incentive plan was 10,000,000 shares of common stock. shares of common stock subject to awards granted under the 2014 incentive plan or the prior 2004 incentive plan that (i) expire unexercised, (ii) are forfeited, terminated or canceled, (iii) are settled in cash or other forms of property, or (iv) otherwise do not result in the issuance of shares of common stock, will be available for grant under the 2014 incentive plan.
capital resources capital resources reflect the overall financial strength of the company and its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet its needs. the following table summarizes the components of the company's capital structure at december 31, 2014 and 2013.

debt:
short-term                                                           $500               $100
long-term                                                                   5,861              6,261
net unamortized fair value adjustments and debt issuance costs                (12   )            (15   )
total debt                                                                  6,349              6,346
shareholders' equity:

accumulated other comprehensive income                               880                810
total shareholders' equity                                                 24,836             24,796
total capitalization                                                 $31,185            $31,142
128
total capitalization at december 31, 2014 was $31.19 billion, $43 million higher than at december 31, 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of net income of $3.69 billion and an increase in net unrealized appreciation of investments, partially offset by common share repurchases totaling $3.28 billion under the company's share repurchase authorization and shareholder dividends of $735 million.
the following table provides a reconciliation of total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains on investments to total capitalization presented in the foregoing table.

total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains on investments              $29,219           $29,820
net unrealized gain on investments, net of taxes                                      1,966             1,322
total capitalization                                                            $31,185           $31,142
debt-to-total capital ratio                                                     20.4          %   20.4          %
debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gains on investments       21.7          %   21.3          %
the debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gain on investments is calculated by dividing (a) debt by (b) total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of taxes. net unrealized gains and losses on investments can be significantly impacted by both interest rate movements and other economic factors. accordingly, in the opinion of the company's management, the debt-to-total capital ratio calculated on this basis provides another useful metric for investors to understand the company's financial leverage position. the company's ratio of debt-to-total capital (excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains) of 21.7% at december 31, 2014 was within the company's target range of 15% to 25%.
credit agreement.    the company is a party to a five-year, $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in june 2018. terms of the credit agreement are discussed in more detail in note 8 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
shelf registration.    the company has filed with the securities and exchange commission a universal shelf registration statement for the potential offering and sale of securities. the company may offer these securities from time to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering.
share repurchase authorization.    at december 31, 2014, the company had $1.48 billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes, as of december 31, 2014, the company's future payments under contractual obligations and estimated claims and claim-related payments. the table excludes short-term liabilities and includes only obligations at december 31, 2014 that are expected to be settled in cash.
the table below includes the amount and estimated future timing of claims and claim-related payments. the amounts do not represent the exact liability, but instead represent estimates, generally utilizing actuarial projections techniques, at a given accounting date. these estimates include expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on the company's assessment of facts and circumstances known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity, frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation or deflation, legal trends and legislative changes. many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. additionally, there may
129
be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the policyholder event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer. the future cash flows related to the items contained in the table below required estimation of both amount (including severity considerations) and timing. amount and timing are frequently estimated separately. an estimation of both amount and timing of future cash flows related to claims and claim-related payments has unavoidable estimation uncertainty.
the contractual obligations at december 31, 2014 were as follows:

the company's $107 million remaining aggregate principal amount of 6.25% fixed-to-floating rate debentures bear interest at an annual rate of 6.25% from the date of issuance to, but excluding, march 15, 2017 and at a rate of three-month libor plus 2.215% thereafter. the table above includes interest payments through the scheduled maturity date of march 15, 2037. interest payments beginning march 15, 2017 through march 15, 2037 were calculated using the three-month libor rate as of december 31, 2014.
see note 8 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of outstanding indebtedness. because the amounts reported in the foregoing table include principal and interest, the total long-term debt obligations will not agree with the amounts reported in note 8.

the amounts in "claims and claim adjustment expenses" in the table above represent the estimated timing of future payments for both reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses, gross of reinsurance recoverables, excluding structured settlements expected to be paid by annuity companies.
the company has entered into reinsurance agreements to manage its exposure to losses and protect its capital as described in note 5 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
in order to qualify for reinsurance accounting, a reinsurance agreement must indemnify the insurer from insurance risk, i.e., the agreement must transfer amount and timing risk. since the timing and amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are directly related to the underlying payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by the insurer, reinsurance recoverables are recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities (the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses) relating to the underlying reinsured contracts. the presence of any feature that can delay timely reimbursement of claims by a reinsurer results in the reinsurance contract being accounted for as a deposit rather than reinsurance. the assumptions used in estimating the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoverables are consistent with those used in estimating the amount and timing of the related liabilities.
the estimated future cash inflows from the company's reinsurance contracts that qualify for reinsurance accounting are as follows:

reinsurance recoverables   $5,627      $748         $1,013      $631   $3,235
the company manages its business and evaluates its liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses on a net of reinsurance basis. the estimated cash flows on a net of reinsurance basis are as follows:

claims and claim adjustment expenses, net   $42,019     $9,163         $9,719      $5,100   $18,037
for business underwritten by non-u.s. operations, future cash flows related to reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses were translated at the spot rate on december 31, 2014.
the amounts reported in the table above and in the table of reinsurance recoverables above are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money. accordingly, the amounts above will differ from the company's balance sheet to the extent that the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses and the related reinsurance recoverables have been discounted in the balance sheet. (see note 1 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.)
131
(7)
workers' compensation large deductible policies provide third party coverage in which the company typically is responsible for paying the entire loss under such policies and then seeks reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount. "claims from large deductible policies" represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related expenses below the deductible amount, net of the estimated recovery of the deductible. the liability and the related deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as "contractholder payables" and "contractholder receivables," respectively. most deductibles for such policies are paid directly from the policyholder's escrow which is periodically replenished by the policyholder. the payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within "claims and claim adjustment expenses" in the above table. because the timing of the collection of the deductible (contractholder receivables) occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a claimant (contractholder payables), these cash flows offset each other in the table.
the estimated timing of the payment of the contractholder payables and the collection of contractholder receivables for workers' compensation policies is presented below:

contractholder payables/receivables   $4,362      $1,089         $1,211      $657   $1,405
(8)
the amounts in "loss-based assessments" relate to estimated future payments of second-injury fund assessments which would result from payment of current claim liabilities. second injury funds cover the cost of any additional benefits for aggravation of a pre-existing condition. for loss-based assessments, the cost is shared by the insurance industry and self-insureds, funded through assessments to insurance companies and self-insureds based on losses. amounts relating to second-injury fund assessments are included in "other liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheet.
(9)
the amounts in "payout from ceded funds withheld" represent estimated payments for losses and return of funds held related to certain reinsurance arrangements whereby the company holds a portion of the premium due to the reinsurer and is allowed to pay claims from the amounts held.
(10)
the company's current liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are $628 million. offsetting these liabilities are deferred tax assets of $588 million associated with the temporary differences that would exist if these positions become realized.
the above table does not include an analysis of liabilities reported for structured settlements for which the company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of default by the company issuing the annuity. the company is not reasonably likely to incur material future payment obligations under such agreements. in addition, the company is not currently subject to any minimum funding requirements for its qualified pension plan. accordingly, future contributions are not included in the foregoing table.
dividend availability the company's principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the state of connecticut. the insurance holding company laws of connecticut applicable to the company's subsidiaries requires notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurer's statutory capital and surplus as of the preceding december 31, or the insurer's net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding december 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation. this declaration or payment is further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. the insurance holding company laws of other states in which the company's subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat
132
more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. a maximum of $3.25 billion is available by the end of 2015 for such dividends to the holding company, trv, without prior approval of the connecticut insurance department. the company may choose to accelerate the timing within 2015 and/or increase the amount of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in 2015, which could result in certain dividends being subject to approval by the connecticut insurance department.
in addition to the regulatory restrictions on the availability of dividends that can be paid by the company's u.s. insurance subsidiaries, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid to the company's shareholders is limited, to a lesser degree, by certain covenants contained in its line of credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that require the company to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth as described in note 8 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
trv is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. the undistributed earnings of the company's foreign operations are not material and are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations.
trv and its two non-insurance holding company subsidiaries received $4.10 billion of dividends in 2014 from their u.s. insurance subsidiaries.
pension and other postretirement benefit plans the company sponsors a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the qualified plan), which covers substantially all u.s. domestic employees and provides benefits primarily under a cash balance formula. in addition, the company sponsors a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan which covers certain highly-compensated employees, pension plans for employees of its foreign subsidiaries, and a postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan for employees satisfying certain age and service requirements and for certain retirees.
the qualified plan is subject to regulations under the employee retirement income act of 1974 as amended (erisa), which requires plans to meet minimum standards of funding and requires such plans to subscribe to plan termination insurance through the pension benefit guaranty corporation (pbgc). the company does not have a minimum funding requirement for the qualified plan for 2015 and does not anticipate having a minimum funding requirement in 2016. the company has significant discretion in making contributions above those necessary to satisfy the minimum funding requirements. in 2014, 2013 and 2012, there was no minimum funding requirement for the qualified plan. in 2014 and 2012, the company voluntarily made contributions totaling $200 million and $217 million, respectively, to the qualified plan. in determining future contributions, the company will consider the performance of the plan's investment portfolio, the effects of interest rates on the projected benefit obligation of the plan and the company's other capital requirements. the company has not determined whether or not additional voluntary funding will be made in the 2015. however, the company currently believes, subject to actual plan performance and funded status at the time, that it may make voluntary pension contributions of approximately $75 million to $100 million annually beginning in 2015 as well as over the following several years.
at december 31, 2014, the company updated its mortality assumptions for estimating its qualified pension plan liabilities utilizing a new mortality table and related improvement scale issued by the society of actuaries in october 2014. the adoption of the new mortality table and related improvement scale increased the projected benefit obligation by $150 million at december 31, 2014.
133
the qualified plan assets are managed to maximize long-term total return while maintaining an appropriate level of risk. the company's overall strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 85% to 90% of investments for long-term growth and 10% to 15% for near-term benefit payments with a diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. the current target allocations for plan assets are 55% to 65% equity securities and 20% to 40% fixed income securities, with the remainder allocated to short-term securities. for 2015, the company plans to apply an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.25%, down from 7.50% in 2014. the expected rate of return reflects the company's current expectations with regard to long-term returns on the qualified plan's invested assets, taking into account the current valuation of u.s. equities, the 75% increase in the s&p 500 index over the past three years and the current low level of long-term interest rates which, according to the federal reserve's commentary in december 2014, are expected to remain at their current low level until its objectives of maximum employment and 2% inflation are achieved. the company's expected long-term rate of return on plan assets also contemplates a return to more normal levels of long-term interest rates in the future.
for further discussion of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, see note 14 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
risk-based capital the naic has an rbc requirement for most property and casualty insurance companies, which determines minimum capital requirements and is intended to raise the level of protection for policyholder obligations. the company's u.s. insurance subsidiaries are subject to these naic rbc requirements based on laws that have been adopted by individual states. these requirements subject insurers having policyholders' surplus less than that required by the rbc calculation to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. each of the company's u.s. insurance subsidiaries had policyholders' surplus at december 31, 2014 significantly above the level at which any rbc regulatory action would occur. regulators in the jurisdictions in which the company's foreign insurance subsidiaries are located require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital depending on, among other things, the type and amount of insurance policies in force. each of the company's foreign insurance subsidiaries had capital significantly above their respective regulatory requirements at december 31, 2014.
off-balance sheet arrangements the company has entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees related to selling businesses to third parties, certain investments, third-party loans related to certain investments, certain insurance policy obligations of former insurance subsidiaries and various other indemnifications. see note 16 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements. the company does not expect these arrangements will have a material effect on the company's financial position, changes in financial position, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
critical accounting estimates the company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and related reinsurance recoverables, investment valuation and impairments, and goodwill and other intangible assets impairments.

the $1.05 billion decrease in gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves since december 31, 2013 primarily reflected the impact of favorable prior year reserve development, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and payments related to operations in runoff.
asbestos and environmental reserves are included in the general liability, commercial multi-peril and international and other lines in the foregoing summary table. asbestos and environmental reserves are discussed separately; see "asbestos claims and litigation", "environmental claims and litigation" and "uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves."
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management's estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported (ibnr). claims and claim adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent management estimates, generally utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques, at a given accounting date. these estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost upon final resolution in the future, based on the company's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors. in establishing gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, the company also considers salvage and subrogation. estimated recoveries from reinsurance are included in "reinsurance recoverables" as an asset on the company's consolidated balance sheet. the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the company.
the process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. these variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, changes in individuals involved in the reserve estimation process, economic inflation, legal trends and legislative changes, among others. the impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). informed judgment is applied throughout the
135
process, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. the company continually refines its estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. the company rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are established. due to the inherent uncertainty underlying these estimates including, but not limited to, the future settlement environment, final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses may be higher or lower than the related claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. therefore, actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, may be materially different than the amount currently recordedfavorable or unfavorable.
because establishment of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, currently established claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may change. the company reflects adjustments to the reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed.
there are also additional risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. for example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes, tornadoes and other catastrophic events can be affected by the inability of the company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties, including the interpretation of policy terms and conditions, and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves. complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; estimating the impact of demand surge, infrastructure disruption, fraud, the effect of mold damage and business interruption costs; and reinsurance collectibility. the timing of a catastrophe, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to the company in estimating reserves for that reporting period. the estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge.
a portion of the company's gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (totaling $2.87 billion at december 31, 2014) are for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. while the ongoing review of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs' expanded theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, in the opinion of the company's management, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current reserves by an amount that could be material to the company's future operating results. see the preceding discussion of "asbestos claims and litigation" and "environmental claims and litigation."
general discussion the process for estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses begins with the collection and analysis of claim data. data on individual reported claims, both current and historical, including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates, are grouped by common characteristics (components) and evaluated by actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities by product line. such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate. the process of analyzing reserves for a component is undertaken on a regular basis, generally quarterly, in light of continually updated information.
multiple estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities. each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and disadvantages, with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components. the relative strengths and
136
weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time. therefore, the actual choice of estimation method(s) can change with each evaluation. the estimation method(s) chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated.
in most cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated. this will result in a range of reasonable estimates for any particular claim liability. the company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves at the reporting segments are reasonable, given subsequent information. reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews. these reviews may substantiate the validity of management's recorded estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate.
the exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature, as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for an estimation method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable. as a result, the company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies. in addition, potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process.
property-casualty insurance policies are either written on a claims-made or on an occurrence basis. claims-made policies generally cover, subject to requirements in individual policies, claims reported during the policy period. policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period, even if the insured reports the loss many years later.
most general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis. these policies are subject to substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years following the policy issuance. the occurrence form, which accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos and environmental exposures, is also used to provide coverage for construction general liability, including construction defect. occurrence-based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of various trends, including future inflation, judicial interpretations and societal litigation trends (e.g., size of jury awards and propensity of individuals to pursue litigation), among others.
a basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future, absent a material change in the associated risk factors discussed below. to the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known, such change is quantified to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company data and, if available and when appropriate, external data. such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated. significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can materially impact the reserve estimation process.
informed judgment is applied throughout the reserving process. this includes the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. in addition to actuaries, experts involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel and lawyers, as well as other company management. therefore, management may have to consider varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. it is also likely that during periods of significant change, such as a merger, consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult.
the variables discussed above in this general discussion have different impacts on reserve estimation uncertainty for a given product line, depending on the length of the claim tail, the reporting lag, the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line.
137
product lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail, based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final resolution of those claims. short tail claims are reported and settled quickly, resulting in less estimation variability. the longer the time before final claim resolution, the greater the exposure to estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty.
a major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag. the reporting lag, which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer, makes estimating ibnr inherently more uncertain. in addition, the greater the reporting lag, the greater the proportion of ibnr to the total claim liability for the product line. writing new products with material reporting lags can result in adding several years' worth of ibnr claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable, thereby increasing the risk associated with pricing and reserving such products. the most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims.
for some lines, the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis. these lines are generally referred to as being "low frequency/high severity," while lines without this "large claim" sensitivity are referred to as "high frequency/low severity." estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency/high severity lines can be sensitive to the impact of a small number of potentially large claims. as a result, the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates. in contrast, for high frequency/low severity lines the impact of individual claims is relatively minor and the range of reasonable reserve estimates is likely narrower and more stable.
claim complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate, the potential stability of the underlying data and claim process, and the ability to gain an understanding of the data. product lines with greater claim complexity, such as for certain surety and construction exposures, have inherently greater estimation uncertainty.
actuaries have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of reserves. the human element in the application of actuarial judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty. different actuaries may choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional experiences and areas of focus. hence, the estimates selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other.
lastly, significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can also materially impact the reserve estimation process. events such as mergers increase the inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time, until stable trends re-establish themselves within the new organization.
risk factors the major causes of material uncertainty ("risk factors") generally will vary for each product line, as well as for each separately analyzed component of the product line. in a few cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method, but in most cases, they are implicit. for example, a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged. actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions, causing actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, to be different in amount than the reserves being estimated currently.
some risk factors will affect more than one product line. examples include changes in claim department practices, changes in settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions, court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants and degree of claimant fraud. the extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line. individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components.
138
the effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most cases. for example, estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the risk associated with potential court rulings, but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other factors.
the evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts, sometimes in unanticipated ways. for example, the timing of claims payments in one geographic region will be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle catastrophe claims in another region.
while some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature (such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction), others are more evolutionary. evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values, with the uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately, in stepwise fashion. the final impact is not known until all steps have occurred.
sudden changes generally cause a one-time shift in claim liability estimates, although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact. evolutionary changes generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates, as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable.
actuarial methods for analyzing and estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves the principal estimation and analysis methods utilized by the company's actuaries to evaluate management's existing estimates for prior accident periods are the paid development method, the case incurred development method, the bornhuetter-ferguson (bf) method, and average value analysis combined with the reported claim development method. the bf method is usually utilized for more recent accident periods, with a transition to other methods as the underlying claim data becomes more voluminous and therefore more credible. these are typically referred to as conventional actuarial methods. (see glossary for an explanation of these methods).
while these are the principal methods utilized throughout the company, actuaries evaluating a particular component for a product line have available to them the full range of methods developed within the casualty actuarial profession. the company's actuaries are also continually monitoring developments within the profession for advances in existing techniques or the creation of new techniques that might improve current and future estimates.
some components of product line reserves are susceptible to relatively infrequent large claims that can materially impact the total estimate for that component. in such cases, the company's actuarial analysis generally isolates and analyzes separately such large claims. the reserves excluding such large claims are generally analyzed using the conventional methods described above. the reserves associated with large claims are then analyzed utilizing various methods, such as:
 estimating the number of large claims and their average values based on historical trends from prior accident periods, adjusted for the current environment and supplemented with actual data for the accident year analyzed to the extent available.
 utilizing individual claim adjuster estimates of the large claims, combined with continual monitoring of the aggregate accuracy of such claim adjuster estimates. (this monitoring may lead to supplemental adjustments to the aggregate of such claim estimates.)
 utilizing historic longer-term average ratios of large claims to small claims, and applying such ratios to the estimated ultimate small claims from conventional analysis.
 ground-up analysis of the underlying exposure (typically used for asbestos and environmental).
139
the results of such methodologies are subjected to various reasonability and diagnostic tests, including paid-to-incurred loss ratios, implied incurred-loss-to-earned-premium ratios and non-zero claim severity trends. an actual versus expected analysis is also performed comparing actual loss development to expected development embedded within management's best estimate. additional analyses may be performed based on the results of these diagnostics, including the investigation of other actuarial methods.
the methods described above are generally utilized to evaluate management's existing estimate for prior accident periods. for the initial estimate of the current accident year, the available claim data is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication. hence, the initial estimate for an accident year is generally based on a loss ratio projection method, which uses the earned premium for the current year multiplied by a projected loss ratio. the projected loss ratio is determined through an analysis of prior periods' experience, using loss trend, rate level differences, mix of business changes and other known or observed factors influencing the current accident year relative to prior accident years. the exact number of prior accident years utilized varies by product line component, based on the volume of business for that component and the reliability of an individual accident year estimate.
management's estimates at least once per quarter, certain members of company management meet with the company's actuaries to review the latest claims and claim adjustment expense reserve analyses. based on these analyses, management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed. in doing so, it must evaluate whether the new data provided represents credible actionable information or an anomaly that will have no effect on estimated ultimate claim liability. for example, as described above, payments may have decreased in one geographic region due to fewer claim adjusters being available to process claims. the resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to determine whether or not the change in payment pattern represents a change in ultimate claim liability.
such an assessment requires considerable judgment. it is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime after the event. even if a change is determined to be permanent, it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until sometime later. the overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several months to perform. this is because the underlying causes of the trends observed need to be evaluated, which may require the gathering or assembling of data not previously available. it may also include interviews with experts involved with the underlying processes. as a result, there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the company's estimated claim liabilities. the final estimate selected by management in a reporting period is based on these various detailed analyses of past data, adjusted to reflect any new actionable information.
the audit committee of the board of directors is responsible for providing oversight of reserving propriety, and annually reviews the process by which the company establishes reserves.
discussion of product lines the following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line. there are many additional risk factors that may impact ultimate claim costs. each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves. also, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves. for example, in workers' compensation, the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster, thereby lowering indemnity costs. thus, in almost all cases, it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation.
in order to provide information on reasonably possible reserving changes by product line, the historical changes in year-end claims and claim adjustment expense reserves over a one-year period are
140
provided for the u.s. product lines. this information is provided for both the company and the industry for the nine most recent years, and is based on the most recent publicly available data for the reported line(s) that most closely match the individual product line being discussed. these changes were calculated, net of reinsurance, from statutory annual statement data found in schedule p of those statements, and represent the reported reserve development on the beginning-of-the-year claim liabilities divided by the beginning claim liabilities, all accident years combined, excluding non-defense related claim adjustment expense. data presented for the company includes history for the entire travelers group (u.s. companies only), whether or not the individual subsidiaries were originally part of the st. paul companies, inc. (spc) or tpc. this treatment is required by the statutory reporting instructions promulgated by state regulatory authorities for schedule p. comparable data for non-u.s. companies is not available.
general liability general liability is generally considered a long tail line, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year. the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction and specific policy provisions such as self-insured retentions. there are numerous components underlying the general liability product line. some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns (with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within five to seven years), while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims (e.g., a reporting lag of a decade or more for "construction defect" claims).
while the majority of general liability coverages are written on an "occurrence" basis, certain general liability coverages (such as those covering directors and officers or professional liability) are typically insured on a "claims-made" basis.
general liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components: primary and excess/umbrella, with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property damage. bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholder's legal obligation arising from non-intentional acts such as negligence, subject to the insurance policy provisions. in some cases the damages can include future wage loss (which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation) and future medical treatment costs. property damage liability payments result from damages to the claimant's private property arising from the policyholder's legal obligation for non-intentional acts. in most cases, property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date, or soon thereafter.
in addition, sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately. these exposures include asbestos, environmental, other mass torts, construction defect and large unique accounts that would otherwise distort the analysis. these unique categories often require a very high degree of judgment and require reserve analyses that do not rely on conventional actuarial methods.
defense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant, sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims. for some products this risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs is included in the policy limit available to pay the claim. such "defense within the limits" policies are most common for "claims-made" products. when defense costs are outside of the policy limits, the full amount of the policy limit is available to pay claims and the amounts paid for defense costs have no contractual limit.
this line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate uncertainty in the united states (excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk). major contributors to this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag (i.e., the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim), the number of parties involved in the underlying tort action, whether the "event" triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods, the potential dollars involved (in the individual claim actions), whether such
141
claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written (i.e., coverage dispute potential), and the potential for mass claim actions. claims with longer reporting lags result in greater inherent risk. this is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature, particularly where courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years, hence involving multiple defendants (and their insurers and reinsurers) and multiple policies (thereby increasing the potential dollars involved and the underlying settlement complexity). claims with long latencies also increase the potential recognition lag (i.e., the lag between writing a type of policy in a certain market and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and/or latent claim exposure).
the amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the general liability product line. the components in this product line with the longest latency, longest reporting lags, largest potential dollars involved and greatest claim settlement complexity are asbestos and environmental. components that include latency, reporting lag and/or complexity issues, but to a materially lesser extent than asbestos and environmental, include construction defect and other mass tort actions. many components of general liability are not subject to material latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components. in general, policies providing coverage with shorter reporting lags, fewer parties involved in settlement negotiations, only one policy potentially triggered per claim, fewer potential settlement dollars, reasonably foreseeable (and stable) potential hazards/claims and no mass tort potential result in much less reserve estimate uncertainty than policies without those characteristics.
in addition to the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion section, the company utilizes various report year development and s-curve methods for the construction defect components of this product line. the construction defect report year development analysis is supplemented with projected claim counts and average values for ibnr claim counts. for components with greater lags in claim reporting, such as excess and umbrella components of this product line, the company relies more heavily on the bf method than on the paid and case incurred development methods.
examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required general liability reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include:
general liability risk factors
 changes in claim handling philosophies
 changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provisions
 new or expanded theories of liability
 trends in jury awards
 changes in the propensity to sue, in general with specificity to particular issues
 changes in the propensity to litigate rather than settle a claim
 changes in statutes of limitations
 changes in the underlying court system
 distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues
 changes in tort law
 shifts in lawsuit mix between federal and state courts
 changes in claim adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data)
 the potential impact of inflation on loss costs
142
 changes in settlement patterns general liability book of business risk factors
 changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements)
 changes in underwriting standards
 product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix)
unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for general liability (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.5% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, over the last nine years has varied from 8% to 2% (averaging 4%) for the company, and from 5% to 2% (averaging 3%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. general liability reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 23% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
the company's change in reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, was 5% for 2014, 4% for 2013 and 3% for 2012. the 2014 change was primarily concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2008 through 2012, reflecting more favorable legal and judicial environments than what the company previously expected. the 2013 change was primarily concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2010 and prior, reflecting more favorable legal and judicial environments than what the company previously expected. the 2012 change was primarily concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2009 and prior, reflecting more favorable legal and judicial environments than what the company previously expected. also contributing to the 2012 change was better than expected results for management liability business, primarily for the errors & omissions and fiduciary products for accident years 2007 and prior.
commercial property commercial property is generally considered a short tail line with a simpler and faster claim reporting and adjustment process than liability coverages, and less uncertainty in the reserve setting process (except for more complex business interruption claims). it is generally viewed as a moderate frequency, low to moderate severity line, except for catastrophes and coverage related to large properties. the claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim reserves is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk, except possibly for catastrophes and business interruption claims.
commercial property reserves are typically analyzed in two components, one for catastrophic or other large single events, and another for all other events. examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required property reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include:
commercial property risk factors
 physical concentration of policyholders
 availability and cost of local contractors
143
 for the more severe catastrophic events, "demand surge" inflation, which refers to significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services
 local building codes
 amount of time to return property to full usage (for business interruption claims)
 frequency of claim re-openings on claims previously closed
 court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, or wind versus flooding)
 lags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake, hail damage to roofs and/or equipment on roofs)
 court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations commercial property book of business risk factors
 policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements)
 changes in underwriting standards unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for property, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from 25% to 5% (averaging 16%) for the company, and from 14% to 5% (averaging 9%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. commercial property reserves represent approximately 3% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
since commercial property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for commercial property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. this is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for commercial property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. this recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to commercial property because of weather-related events which, notwithstanding 2013 and 2014 experience, tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and generally are not completely resolved until the following year. reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve. the reserve estimates for this product line are also potentially subject to material changes due to uncertainty in measuring ultimate losses for significant catastrophes such as the events of september 11, 2001, hurricane katrina and storm sandy.
the company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 18% for 2014, 17% for 2013 and 22% for 2012. the 2014 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2010 through 2013, including catastrophe losses from storm sandy for accident year 2012. the 2013 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2010 through 2012, driven by favorable loss development related to both catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses. the 2012 change primarily reflected better than expected development for accident years 2009 through 2011, driven by favorable loss development related to catastrophe losses incurred in 2011, and by higher subrogation and salvage recoveries for accident years 2009 through 2011.
144
commercial multi-peril commercial multi-peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. for property coverage, it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims, while for the other coverages, generally for the liability coverages, it takes a longer period of time to close claims.
the reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product, except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or large single losses. the reserving risk for this line differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the customer. commercial multi-peril is generally sold to smaller-sized accounts, while the customer profile for general liability and commercial property includes larger customers.
see "commercial property risk factors" and "general liability risk factors," discussed above, with regard to reserving risk for commercial multi-peril.
unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial multi-peril (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from 19% to 5% (averaging 4%) for the company, and from 6% to 0% (averaging 3%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. commercial multi-peril reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental reserves) represent approximately 7% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
as discussed above, this line combines general liability and commercial property coverages and it has been impacted in the past by many of the same events as those two lines.
the company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 3% for 2014, 2% for 2013 and 1% for 2012. the 2014 change primarily reflected higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2010 through 2013. the 2013 change primarily reflected higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2008 through 2011, driven by higher than expected severity and defense costs.
commercial automobile the commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. the payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. the payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. in general, claim reporting lags are minor, claim complexity is not a major issue, and the line is viewed as high frequency, low to moderate severity. overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk.
commercial automobile reserves are typically analyzed in four components: bodily injury liability; property damage liability; collision claims; and comprehensive claims. these last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate risk factors are not presented.
the company utilizes the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion above in estimating claim liabilities for this line. this is supplemented with detailed custom analyses where needed.
145

bodily injury and property damage liability risk factors
 trends in jury awards
 changes in the underlying court system
 changes in case law
 litigation trends
 frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits
 change in average severity of accidents, or proportion of severe accidents
 changes in auto safety technology
 subrogation opportunities

 frequency of visits to health providers
 number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers
 types of health providers used
 types of medical treatments received
 changes in cost of medical treatments
 degree of patient responsiveness to treatment commercial automobile book of business risk factors
 changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.)
 changes in mix of insured vehicles (e.g., long haul trucks versus local and smaller vehicles, fleet risks versus non-fleets)
 changes in underwriting standards unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial automobile, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from 10% to 7% (averaging 2%) for the company, and from 3% to 3% (averaging 1%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. commercial automobile reserves represent approximately 7% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
the company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 2% for 2014, 1% for 2013 and 7% for 2012. the 2014 change reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years
146
2011 and 2012. the 2012 change reflected higher than expected severity in the bodily injury coverage primarily for accident years 2010 and 2011.
workers' compensation workers' compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year. while certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly, some other payments are made over the course of several years, such as awards for permanent partial injuries. in addition, some payments can run as long as the injured worker's life, such as permanent disability benefits and on-going medical care. despite the possibility of long payment tails, the reporting lags are generally short, settlements are generally not complex, and most of the liability can be considered high frequency with moderate severity. the largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency, high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a worker's injury, as such claims are subject to greater inflation risk. overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk.
workers' compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three components: indemnity losses, medical losses and claim adjustment expenses.
examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required workers' compensation reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include:
indemnity risk factors
 time required to recover from the injury
 degree of available transitional jobs
 degree of legal involvement
 changes in the interpretations and processes of the administrative bodies that oversee workers' compensation claims
 future wage inflation for states that index benefits
 changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds medical risk factors
 changes in the cost of medical treatments (including prescription drugs) and underlying fee schedules ("inflation")
 frequency of visits to health providers
 number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers
 types of health providers used
 type of medical treatments received
 use of preferred provider networks and other medical cost containment practices
 availability of new medical processes and equipment
 changes in the use of pharmaceutical drugs
 degree of patient responsiveness to treatment
147
general workers' compensation risk factors
 frequency of claim reopenings on claims previously closed
 mortality trends of injured workers with lifetime benefits and medical treatment
 degree of cost shifting between workers' compensation and health insurance, including medicare, and the impact, if any, of the affordable care act workers' compensation book of business risk factors
 product mix
 injury type mix
 changes in underwriting standards unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for workers' compensation, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from 2% to 1% (averaging 0%) for the company, and from 2 to 2% (averaging 0%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. workers' compensation reserves represent approximately 37% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
the company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 0% for 2014, 1% in 2013 and 2% in 2012. the 2012 change was primarily driven by better than expected frequency and severity related to lifetime medical claims for accident years 2008 and prior.
fidelity and surety fidelity is generally considered a short tail coverage. it takes a relatively short period of time to finalize and settle most fidelity claims. the volatility of fidelity reserves is generally related to the type of business of the insured, the size and complexity of the insured's business operations, amount of policy limit and attachment point of coverage. the uncertainty surrounding reserves for small, commercial insureds is typically less than the uncertainty for large commercial or financial institutions. the high frequency, low severity nature of small commercial fidelity losses provides for stability in loss estimates, whereas the low frequency, high severity nature of losses for large insureds results in a wider range of ultimate loss outcomes. actuarial techniques that rely on a stable pattern of loss development are generally not applicable to low frequency, high severity claims.
surety has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags, although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can result in a long settlement tail, based on the length and complexity of the construction project(s) or commercial transaction being insured. (large construction projects can take many years to complete.) the frequency of losses in surety generally correlates with economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability of an insured to fulfill its contractual obligations. the company actively seeks to mitigate this exposure to loss through disciplined risk selection, adherence to underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring of contractor progress in significant construction projects. the volatility of surety losses is generally related to the type of business performed by the insured, the type of bonded obligation, the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets available to the insurer to mitigate losses, such as unbilled contract funds, collateral, first and third party indemnity, and other
148
security positions of an insured's assets. certain classes of surety claims are very high severity, low frequency in nature. these can include large construction contractors involved with one or multiple large, complex projects as well as certain large commercial surety exposures. other claim factors affecting reserve variability of surety include litigation related to amounts owed by and due the insured (e.g., salvage and subrogation efforts) and the results of financial restructuring of an insured.
examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required fidelity and surety reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include:
fidelity risk factors
 type of business of insured
 policy limit and attachment points
 third-party claims
 coverage litigation
 complexity of claims
 growth in insureds' operations surety risk factors
 economic trends, including the general level of construction activity
 concentration of reserves in a relatively few large claims
 type of business insured
 type of obligation insured
 cumulative limits of liability for insured
 assets available to mitigate loss
 defective workmanship/latent defects
 financial strategy of insured
 changes in statutory obligations
 geographic spread of business fidelity and surety book of business risk factors
 changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, limits, endorsements)
 changes in underwriting standards unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for fidelity and surety, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from 36% to 1% (averaging 12%) for the company, and from 13% to 14% (averaging 5%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. fidelity and surety reserves represent approximately 2% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
149
in general, developments on single large claims (both adverse and favorable) are a primary source of changes in reserve estimates for this product line.
the company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 36% for 2014, 21% for 2013 and 8% for 2012. the 2014 change reflected better than expected loss experience in the contract surety product line for accident years 2012 and prior. the 2013 change reflected better than expected loss experience in the contract surety product line for accident years 2010 and prior. the 2012 change reflected better than expected loss experience in the contract surety product line for accident years 2008 and prior.
personal automobile personal automobile includes both short and long tail coverages. the payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. the payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. reporting lags are relatively short and the claim settlement process for personal automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products. it is generally viewed as a high frequency, low to moderate severity product line. overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk.
personal automobile reserves are typically analyzed in five components: bodily injury liability, property damage liability, no-fault losses, collision claims and comprehensive claims. these last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate factors are not presented.
examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required personal automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general reserve discussion section) include:

 changes in the use of credit data for rating and underwriting unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for personal automobile, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from 7% to 3% (averaging 1%) for the company, and from 4% to 1% (averaging 3%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. personal automobile reserves represent approximately 5% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
the company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 1% for 2014, 1% for 2013 and 2% for 2012. the 2012 change was primarily driven by higher than expected bodily injury severity for accident year 2011.
homeowners and personal lines other homeowners is generally considered a short tail coverage. most payments are related to the property portion of the policy, where the claim reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs, although delays of several months are not unusual. the resulting settlement process is typically fairly short term, although exceptions do exist.
the liability portion of the homeowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation, but with generally small reporting lags.
overall, the line is generally high frequency, low to moderate severity (except for catastrophes), with simple to moderate claim complexity.
homeowners reserves are typically analyzed in two components: non-catastrophe related losses and catastrophe loss payments.
examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required homeowners reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include:
non-catastrophe risk factors
 salvage opportunities
 amount of time to return property to residential use
 changes in weather patterns
 local building codes
 litigation trends
151
 trends in jury awards
 court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, or wind versus flooding)
 lags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake, hail damage to roofs and/or equipment on roofs)
 court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations catastrophe risk factors
 physical concentration of policyholders
 availability and cost of local contractors
 local building codes
 quality of construction of damaged homes
 amount of time to return property to residential use
 for the more severe catastrophic events, "demand surge" inflation, which refers to significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services homeowners book of business risk factors
 policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.)
 degree of concentration of policyholders
 changes in underwriting standards
 changes in the use of credit data for rating and underwriting unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for homeowners and personal lines other, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line (excluding the umbrella line of business, which for statutory reporting purposes is included with the general liability line of business) over the last nine years has varied from 22% to 2% (averaging 11%) for the company, and from 7% to 2% (averaging 5%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. homeowners and personal lines other reserves represent approximately 2% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
this line combines both liability and property coverages; however, the majority of the reserves relate to property. while property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. this is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. this recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because of weather related events which, notwithstanding 2010 and 2011 experience, tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and generally are not completely resolved until the following year. reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve.
the company's change in reserve estimate for this product line (excluding the umbrella line of business) was 16% for 2014, 17% for 2013 and 11% for 2012. the 2014 change was primarily
152
driven by better than expected loss experience for non-catastrophe weather-related losses for accident year 2013 and for catastrophe losses for accident years 2011 through 2013. the 2013 change was primarily driven by better than expected loss experience for catastrophe losses incurred in 2012 and non-catastrophe weather-related losses and non-weather-related losses for accident years 2012 and 2011. the 2012 change reflected better than expected loss development related to catastrophe losses incurred in 2011 and non-catastrophe losses incurred in accident years 2010 and 2011.
international and other international and other includes products written by the company's international operations, as well as all other products not explicitly discussed above. the principal component of "other" claim reserves is assumed reinsurance written on an excess-of-loss basis, which may include reinsurance of non-u.s. exposures, and is runoff business.
international and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages, currencies and jurisdictions/countries. the common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the individual component, and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in the u.s. statutory reporting framework.
due to changes in the business mix for this line over time, including the recent acquisition of dominion, the recently incurred claim liabilities are relatively shorter tail (due to both the products and the jurisdictions involved, e.g., canada, the republic of ireland and the united kingdom), while the older liabilities include some from runoff operations that are extremely long tail (e.g., u.s. excess liabilities reinsured through the london market, and several underwriting pools in runoff). the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction, the distribution system (e.g., underwriting pool versus direct) and the proximity of the insurance sale to the insured hazard (e.g., insured and insurer located in different countries). in particular, liabilities arising from the underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags, settlement lags and claim complexity, due to the need to coordinate with other pool members or co-insurers through a broker or lead-insurer for claim settlement purposes.
international reserves are generally analyzed by country and general coverage category (e.g., general liability in canada, commercial property in the united kingdom, etc.). the business is also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a given coverage. where the underlying insured hazard is outside the united states, the underlying coverages are generally similar to those described under the homeowners, personal automobile, commercial automobile, general liability, commercial property and surety discussions above, taking into account differences in the legal environment and differences in terms and conditions. for example, in some jurisdictions there are no aggregate policy limits on certain liability coverages.
other reserves, primarily assumed reinsurance in runoff, are generally analyzed by program/pool, treaty type, and general coverage category (e.g., general liabilityexcess of loss reinsurance). excess exposure requires the insured to "prove" not only claims under the policy, but also the prior payment of claims reaching up to the excess policy's attachment point.
examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required international and other reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section, and in the personal automobile, homeowners, general liability, commercial property, commercial automobile and surety discussions above) include:
international and other risk factors
 changes in claim handling procedures, including those of the primary carriers
 changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provision
153
 economic trends
 new theories of liability
 trends in jury awards
 changes in the propensity to sue
 changes in statutes of limitations
 changes in the underlying court system
 distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues
 changes in tort law
 changes in claim adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data)
international and other book of business risk factors
 changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, "claims-made" language)
 changes in underwriting standards
 product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix)
unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for international and other (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. international and other reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 9% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
international and other represents a combination of different product lines, some of which are in runoff. comparative historical information is not available for international product lines as insurers domiciled outside of the u.s. do not file u.s. statutory reports. comparative historical information on runoff business is not indicative of reasonably possible one-year changes in the reserve estimate for this mix of runoff business. accordingly, the company has not included comparative analyses for international and other.
reinsurance recoverables amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability. the company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. in addition, in the ordinary course of business, the company becomes involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers. some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the company's rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. the company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes.
the company has entered into two reinsurance contracts in connection with catastrophe bonds issued by long point re iii. both of these contracts meet the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with guidance for accounting for reinsurance contracts. the catastrophe bonds are described in more detail in "item 1businesscatastrophe reinsurance."
154
the company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. the allowance is based upon the company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors. accordingly, the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. from time to time, as a result of the long-tailed nature of the underlying liabilities, coverage complexities and potential for disputes, the company considers the commutation of reinsurance contracts. changes in estimated reinsurance recoverables and commutation activity could result in additional income statement charges.
recoverables attributable to structured settlements relate primarily to personal injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion, for which the company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of a default by the companies issuing the annuities. recoverables attributable to mandatory pools and associations relate primarily to workers' compensation service business. these recoverables are supported by the participating insurance companies' obligation to pay a pro rata share based on each company's voluntary market share of written premium in each state in which it is a pool participant. in the event a member of a mandatory pool or association defaults on its share of the pool's or association's obligations, the other members' share of such obligation increases proportionally.

investment valuation and impairments fair value measurements the company's estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. the framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. the disclosure of fair value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. in determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the company's significant market assumptions. the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:
 level 1unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the company has the ability to access.
 level 2quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severities, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data.
 level 3valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable. the unobservable inputs reflect the company's own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use.
valuation of investments reported at fair value in financial statements the fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable, unrelated, willing parties, i.e., not in a
155
forced transaction. the estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the security was sold in an immediate sale, e.g., a forced transaction. additionally, the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based inputs, which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur.
for investments that have quoted market prices in active markets, the company uses the unadjusted quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in level 1 of the hierarchy. the company receives the quoted market prices from third party, nationally recognized pricing services. when quoted market prices are unavailable, the company utilizes these pricing services to determine an estimate of fair value. the fair value estimates provided from these pricing services are included in the amount disclosed in level 2 of the hierarchy. if quoted market prices and an estimate from a pricing service are unavailable, the company produces an estimate of fair value based on internally developed valuation techniques, which, depending on the level of observable market inputs, will render the fair value estimate as level 2 or level 3. the company bases all of its estimates of fair value for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third-party market participant would be willing to pay in an arm's length transaction.
fixed maturities the company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately 98% of its fixed maturities at both december 31, 2014 and 2013. the pricing service utilizes market quotations for fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets. since fixed maturities other than u.s. treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing service prepares estimates of fair value measurements for these securities using its proprietary pricing applications, which include available relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. additionally, the pricing service uses an option adjusted spread model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios.
the pricing service evaluates each asset class based on relevant market information, relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news. the market inputs utilized in the pricing evaluation, listed in the approximate order of priority, include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, and industry and economic events. the extent of the use of each market input depends on the asset class and the market conditions. depending on the security, the priority of the use of inputs may change or some market inputs may not be relevant. for some securities, additional inputs may be necessary.
the pricing service utilized by the company has indicated that it will only produce an estimate of fair value if there is objectively verifiable information to produce a valuation. if the pricing service discontinues pricing an investment, the company would be required to produce an estimate of fair value using some of the same methodologies as the pricing service but would have to make assumptions for any market-based inputs that were unavailable due to market conditions.
the fair value estimates of most fixed maturity investments are based on observable market information rather than market quotes. accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such fixed maturities, other than u.s. treasury securities, provided by the pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level 2 of the hierarchy. the estimated fair value of u.s. treasury securities is included in the amount disclosed in level 1 as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices.
the company reviews the estimates of fair value provided by the pricing service and compares the estimates to the company's knowledge of the market to determine if the estimates obtained are representative of the prices in the market. in addition, the company has periodic discussions with the pricing service to discuss any changes in their process and reactions to overall markets. the company
156
produces a report monthly that lists all price changes from the previous month in excess of 10%. the company reviews the report and will challenge any prices deemed not to be representative of fair value. in addition, the company has implemented various other processes including randomly selecting purchased or sold securities and comparing execution prices to the estimates from the pricing service as well as reviewing reports that contain securities whose valuation did not change from their previous valuation (stale price review). the company also uses an additional independent pricing service to further test the primary pricing service's valuation of the company's fixed maturity portfolio. these processes have not highlighted any significant issues with the fair value estimates received from the pricing service.
the company also holds certain fixed maturity investments which are not priced by the pricing service and, accordingly, estimates the fair value of such fixed maturities using an internal matrix that is based on market information regarding interest rates, credit spreads and liquidity. the underlying source data for calculating the matrix of credit spreads relative to the u.s. treasury curve are the bofa merrill lynch u.s. corporate index and the bofa merrill lynch high yield bb rated index. the company includes the fair value estimates of these corporate bonds in level 2, since all significant inputs are market observable.
while the vast majority of the company's municipal bonds and corporate bonds are included in level 2, the company holds a number of municipal bonds and corporate bonds which are not valued by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation. due to the limited amount of observable market information, the company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in level 3. the fair value of the fixed maturities for which the company used an internal pricing matrix was $92 million and $94 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. additionally, the company holds a small amount of other fixed maturity investments that have characteristics that make them unsuitable for matrix pricing. for these fixed maturities, the company obtains a quote from a broker (primarily the market maker). the fair value of the fixed maturities for which the company received a broker quote was $140 million and $161 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. due to the disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only, the company includes these fair value estimates in level 3.
non-fixed maturities and other investments not reported at fair value see note 4 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the determination of fair value of non-fixed maturities and valuation of investments not reported at fair value in the financial statements.
investment impairments the company conducts a periodic review to identify and evaluate invested assets having other-than-temporary impairments. some of the factors considered in identifying other-than-temporary impairments include: (1) for fixed maturity investments, whether the company intends to sell the investment or whether it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value; (2) for non-fixed maturity investments, the company's ability and intent to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; (3) the likelihood of the recoverability of principal and interest for fixed maturity securities (i.e., whether there is a credit loss) or cost for equity securities; (4) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed maturity securities or cost for equity securities; and (5) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects for the issuer, including the relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices.
157
other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturities and equity securities for fixed maturity investments that the company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the company would not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors and reports the credit loss component in net realized investment gains (losses). the impairment related to all other factors is reported in other comprehensive income.
for equity securities (including public common and non-redeemable preferred stock) and for fixed maturity investments the company intends to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount of the impairment is included in net realized investment gains (losses).
upon recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment, the new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in net realized investment gains (losses). the new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value; however, for fixed maturity investments the difference between the new cost basis and the expected cash flows is accreted on a quarterly basis to net investment income over the remaining expected life of the investment.
due to the subjective nature of the company's analysis and estimates of future cash flows, along with the judgment that must be applied in the analysis, it is possible that the company could reach a different conclusion whether or not to impair a security if it had access to additional information about the issuer. additionally, it is possible that the issuer's actual ability to meet contractual obligations may be different than what the company determined during its analysis, which may lead to a different impairment conclusion in future periods.
see note 1 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of investment impairments.
goodwill and other intangible assets impairments see note 1 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets.
other uncertainties for a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that could impact the company's results of operations or financial position, see note 16 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements and "item 1arisk factors."
future application of accounting standards see note 1 of the notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards updates.
the company is currently required to prepare its financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), as promulgated by the financial accounting standards board (fasb). during the last several years, the securities and exchange commission (sec) has been evaluating whether, when and how international financial reporting standards (ifrs) should be incorporated into the u.s. financial reporting system. in july 2012, the sec staff issued a final report on its work plan which concluded that ifrs provide high quality accounting standards, but also indicated concerns with funding, consistency of application and enforcement of ifrs globally. in november 2014, the sec announced that it intends to develop a recommendation in the next couple of months on whether the sec should move towards using ifrs for public companies.
158
the fasb and the international accounting standards board (iasb) are in the final phases of their long-term convergence program with the intent of developing global standards for several significant areas of accounting, including the accounting for insurance contracts and financial instruments. in february 2014, the fasb decided to discontinue the full insurance project and instead make targeted changes to u.s. gaap for insurance contracts. for property and casualty insurance contracts, the fasb decided to limit the targeted improvements to enhanced disclosures and is targeting the first quarter of 2015 to finalize the new disclosure requirements. the iasb is expected to complete its project in 2016 which may require valuation and accounting that is significantly different than under the u.s. gaap model for short-duration contracts.
in 2014, the iasb issued a final financial instruments standard with an effective date of january 1, 2018, which provides guidance that is significantly different than current u.s. gaap, e.g., under the new ifrs standard changes in the fair value of investments in equity securities would be reported in earnings whereas current u.s. gaap reports such changes in other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders' equity. the fasb is in the final stages of completing an update to its current financial instruments guidance. the fasb has tentatively decided on different models for impairments, and classification and measurement of financial instruments than the iasb. the tentative fasb decisions would result in minor changes in the accounting of financial instruments for the company's consolidated financial statements.
it appears likely that the boards will have different insurance and financial instrument standards that could result in the company having to apply accounting standards for its consolidated financial statements that are different from the accounting standard used for local reporting in foreign jurisdictions.
the company is not able to predict whether it will choose to, or be required to, adopt ifrs or how the adoption of ifrs may impact the company's financial statements in the future.
forward-looking statements this report contains, and management may make, certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. all statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements. words such as "may," "will," "should," "likely," "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "projects," "believes," "estimates" and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. specifically, statements about the company's outlook, share repurchase plans, expected margin improvement, potential returns, future pension plan contributions and the potential impact of investment markets and other economic conditions on the company's investment portfolio and underwriting results, among others, are forward looking, and the company may also make forward-looking statements about, among other things:
 its results of operations and financial condition (including, among other things, premium volume, premium rates, net and operating income, investment income and performance, loss costs, return on equity, and expected current returns and combined ratios);
 the sufficiency of the company's asbestos and other reserves;
 the impact of emerging claims issues as well as other insurance and non-insurance litigation;
 the cost and availability of reinsurance coverage;
 catastrophe losses;
 the impact of investment, economic and underwriting market conditions; and
 strategic initiatives, including initiatives, such as in personal insurance, to improve profitability and competitiveness.

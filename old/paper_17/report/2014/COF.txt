item 1a. risk factors business risks this section highlights specific risks that could affect our business. although we have tried to discuss all material risks of which we are aware at the time this annual report on form 10-k has been filed, other risks may prove to be important in the future, including those that are not currently ascertainable. in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements include:
changes in the macroeconomic environment may adversely affect our industry, business, results of operations and financial condition.
we offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients. we market our credit card products on a national basis throughout the united states, canada and the united kingdom and offer banking and other services in many regions within the united states. although the u.s. economy has improved in recent years, the macroeconomic environment remains unstable and many regions in the world continue to experience economic instability or recession. if a recovery in any of our markets is not sustained or is reversed, the macroeconomic environment may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as customers default on their loans or maintain lower deposit levels or, in the case of credit card accounts, carry lower balances and reduce credit card purchase activity.
in particular, we may face the following risks in connection with adverse changes in macroeconomic environment:
•   payment patterns may change, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. in addition, changes in consumer confidence levels and behavior, including decreased consumer spending, lower demand for credit and a shift in consumer payment behavior towards avoiding late fees, finance charges and other fees, could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
•   increases in bankruptcies could cause increases in our charge-off rates, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
•   our ability to recover debt that we have previously charged-off may be limited, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
•   the process and models we use to estimate our allowance for loan and lease losses may become less reliable if actual losses diverge from the projections of our models as a result of changes in customer behavior, volatile economic conditions or other unexpected variations in key inputs and assumptions. as a result, our estimates for credit losses may become increasingly subject to management's judgment and high levels of volatility over short periods of time, which could negatively impact on our results of operations.
•   our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to underwrite and manage our customers become less predictive of future losses, which could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations.
•   significant concern exists regarding risks associated with financial market instability related to the diverging policies of global central banks. in particular, the federal reserve has moved toward a less accommodative policy stance while central banks in other major economies, notably europe and china, have taken steps to further ease monetary policy. this divergence in federal reserve policy relative to other major central bank policies has impacted financial markets globally, including in the united states. these changes have increased financial market volatility. financial market instability worldwide could threaten the economic recoveries both globally and in the united states, which could have a negative impact on our financial results.

•   our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in funding transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations, which could limit our access to funding. the interest rates that we pay on the securities we have issued are also influenced by, among other things, applicable credit ratings from recognized rating agencies. a downgrade to any of these credit ratings could affect our ability to access the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs and have a negative impact on our results of operations. increased charge-offs, rising london interbank offering rate ("libor") and other events may cause our securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled, which could accelerate our need for additional funding from other sources.
•   an inability to accept or maintain deposits or to obtain other sources of funding could materially affect our ability to fund our business and our liquidity position. many other financial institutions have also increased their reliance on deposit funding and, as such, we expect continued competition in the deposit markets. we cannot predict how this competition will affect our costs. if we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted.
•   shorter-term interest rates have remained at historically low levels for a prolonged period of time. in addition, longer-term interest rates have recently declined, resulting in a flatter yield curve. both shorter-term and longer-term interest rates remain below historical averages. a flat yield curve combined with low interest rates generally leads to lower revenue and reduced margins because it would limit our opportunity to increase the spread between asset yields and funding costs. sustained periods of time with a flat yield curve coupled with low interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and our net interest margin.
•   the low interest rate environment also increases our exposure to prepayment risk in our mortgage portfolio and the mortgage-backed securities in our investment portfolio. increased prepayments, refinancing or other factors that impact loan balances would reduce expected revenue associated with mortgage assets and could also lead to a reduction in the value of our mortgage servicing rights, which could have a negative impact on our financial results.
compliance with new and existing laws, regulations and regulatory expectations may increase our costs, reduce our revenue, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities, and increase compliance challenges.
there has been increased legislation and regulation with respect to the financial services industry in the last few years, and we expect that oversight of our business will continue to expand in scope and complexity. a wide and increasing array of banking and consumer lending laws apply to almost every aspect of our business. failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial, structural and operational penalties, including receivership, and could result in negative publicity or damage to our reputation with regulators or the public. in addition, establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.
the dodd-frank act, as well as the related rules and regulations adopted by various regulatory agencies, could have a significant adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. the dodd-frank act is a comprehensive financial reform act that requires, among other things, enhanced prudential standards (including capital, liquidity, risk management, single-counterparty credit exposure limits, early remediation, and resolution planning), enhanced supervision (including stress testing), prohibitions on proprietary trading and investments in covered funds (referred to as the "volcker rule") and increased transparency and regulation of derivatives trading. the dodd-frank act also provides heightened expectations for risk management and regulatory oversight of all aspects of large financial institutions, including us. many aspects of the law remain to be implemented under the rulemaking and regulatory authority of the sec, the cftc and federal banking regulators. the dodd-frank act also created the cfpb, which regulates our businesses with respect to our compliance with certain consumer laws and regulations and trade practices.
although it is clear that the dodd-frank act and implementing regulations materially impact large financial institutions like us, the rulemaking and related interpretive process has been progressing methodically, and we may not experience the ultimate impact of the dodd-frank act for years. though some aspects of the dodd-frank act may significantly impact our financial condition or results of operations, other aspects of the law may not apply to us. nevertheless, the law has increased our need to build new compliance processes and infrastructure and to otherwise enhance our risk management throughout all aspects of our business. the cumulative impact includes higher expectations for the amount of capital and liquidity we must maintain, as discussed in more detail below under the heading "we may not be able to maintain adequate capital or liquidity levels, which could have a negative impact on our financial results," and higher operational costs, which may further increase once regulators fully implement the law. in addition, u.s. government agencies charged with adopting and interpreting laws, rules and regulations,
16      capital one financial corporation (cof)
including under the dodd-frank act, may do so in an unforeseen manner, including ways that potentially expand the reach of the laws, rules or regulations more than initially contemplated or currently anticipated.
some rules and regulations may be subject to litigation or other challenges that delay or modify their implementation and impact on us. for example, rules implementing the dodd-frank act's requirement that the amount of any interchange fee received by a debit card issuer with respect to debit card transactions be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction are currently subject to challenge. it is unclear how the ruling and appeal will impact the federal reserve's interchange fee rules. future changes in the federal reserve's interchange fee rules could adversely impact revenue from our debit card business.
under various state and federal statutes and regulations, we are required to observe various data security and privacy-related requirements, including establishing appropriate information security standards and safeguards, data security breach response programs and properly authenticating customers before processing or enabling certain types of transactions or interactions. future federal and state legislation and regulation could further restrict how we collect, use, share and secure customer information. the failure to observe any one or more of these requirements could subject us to litigation or enforcement actions and impact some of our current or planned business initiatives.
we have a large number of customer accounts in our credit card and auto lending businesses and we have made the strategic choice to originate and service subprime credit cards and auto loans which typically have higher delinquencies and charge-offs than prime customers. accordingly, we have significant involvement with credit bureau reporting and the collection and recovery of delinquent and charged off debt. the banking industry is subject to enhanced legal and regulatory scrutiny regarding credit bureau reporting and debt collection practices from regulators, courts and legislators. in addition, over the last several years, state and federal regulators have focused on compliance with the bank secrecy act and anti-money laundering laws, data integrity and security, use of service providers, fair lending and other consumer protection issues. any future changes to our business practices, including our debt collection practices, whether mandated by regulators, courts, legislators or otherwise, or any legal liabilities resulting from our business practices, including our debt collection practices, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.
we are subject to heightened regulatory oversight by the federal banking regulators to ensure that we build systems and processes that are commensurate with the nature of our business and that meet the heightened risk management and enhanced prudential standards issued by our regulators. we expect this heightened oversight will continue for the foreseeable future until we meet the expectations of our regulators and can demonstrate that our systems and processes are sustainable.
the legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably and may negatively influence our revenue, costs, earnings, growth and capital levels. certain laws and regulations, and any interpretations and applications with respect thereto, may benefit consumers, borrowers and depositors, but not stockholders. our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws and regulations. for a description of the material laws and regulations to which we are subject, please refer to "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation."
we may experience increased delinquencies and credit losses.
like other lenders, we face the risk that our customers will not repay their loans. rising losses or leading indicators of rising losses (such as higher delinquencies, higher rates of non-performing loans, higher bankruptcy rates, lower collateral values or elevated unemployment rates) may require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses, which may degrade our profitability if we are unable to raise revenue or reduce costs to compensate for higher losses. in particular, we face the following risks in this area:
•   missed payments: our customers may miss payments. loan charge-offs (including from bankruptcies) are generally preceded by missed payments or other indications of worsening financial condition for our customers. customers are more likely to miss payments during an economic downturn or prolonged periods of slow economic growth. in addition, we face the risk that consumer and commercial customer behavior may change (for example, an increase in the unwillingness or inability of customers to repay debt), causing a long-term rise in delinquencies and charge-offs.
•   estimates of inherent losses: the credit quality of our portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings. we allow for and reserve against credit risks based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolios. this process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions. we may underestimate our inherent losses and fail to hold a loan loss allowance sufficient to account for these losses. incorrect assumptions could lead to material underestimations of inherent losses and inadequate allowance for loan and lease losses. in cases where we modify a loan, if the modifications do not perform as anticipated we may be
17      capital one financial corporation (cof)
required to build additional allowance on these loans. the build or release of allowances impacts our current financial results.
•   underwriting: our ability to assess the credit worthiness of our customers may diminish. if the models and approaches we use to select, manage and underwrite our consumer and commercial customers become less predictive of future charge-offs (due, for example, to rapid changes in the economy, including the unemployment rate), our credit losses may increase and our returns may deteriorate.
•   business mix: we engage in a diverse mix of businesses with a broad range of potential credit exposure. our business mix could change in ways that could adversely affect the credit quality of our portfolio. because we originate a relatively greater proportion of consumer loans in our loan portfolio compared to other large bank peers and originate both prime and subprime credit card accounts and auto loans, we may experience higher delinquencies and a greater number of accounts charging off compared to other large bank peers, which could result in increased credit losses, operating costs and regulatory scrutiny.
•   charge-off recognition: the rules governing charge-off recognition could change. we record charge-offs according to accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules. these guidelines and rules, including financial accounting standards board ("fasb") standards and the ffiec account management guidance, could require changes in our account management or loss allowance practices and cause our charge-offs and/or allowance for loan and lease losses to increase for reasons unrelated to the underlying performance of our portfolio. such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operation.
•   industry developments: our charge-off and delinquency rates may be negatively impacted by industry developments, including new regulations applicable to our industry.
•   collateral: the collateral we have on secured loans could be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses. when customers default on their secured loans, we attempt to seize collateral where permissible and appropriate. however, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan, and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from our customers. decreases in real estate values adversely affect the collateral value for our commercial lending and home loan activities, while the auto business is similarly exposed to collateral risks arising from the auction markets that determine used car prices. therefore, the recovery of such property could be insufficient to compensate us for the value of these loans. borrowers may be less likely to continue making payments on loans if the value of the property used as collateral for the loan is less than what the borrower owes, even if the borrower is still financially able to make the payments. trends in home prices are a driver of credit costs in our home loan business as they impact both the probability of default and the loss severity of defaults. additionally, the potential volatility in the number of defaulted and modified loans from changes in home prices can create material impacts on the servicing costs of the business, fluctuations in credit marks and profitability in acquired portfolios and volatility in mortgage servicing rights valuations. although home prices have generally appreciated recently, the slow economic recovery, shifts in monetary policy and potentially diminishing demands from investors could threaten or limit the recovery. in our auto business, if vehicle prices experience declines, we could be adversely affected. for example, business and economic conditions that negatively affect household incomes, housing prices, and consumer behavior related to our businesses could decrease (1) the demand for new and used vehicles and (2) the value of the collateral underlying our portfolio of auto loans, which could cause the number of consumers who become delinquent or default on their loans to increase.
•   geographic and industry concentration. although our consumer lending is geographically diversified, approximately 37% of our commercial loan portfolio is concentrated in the new york metropolitan area. the regional economic conditions in the new york area affect the demand for our commercial products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay their commercial loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. an economic downturn or prolonged period of slow economic growth in, or a catastrophic event that disproportionately affects, the new york region could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our commercial loan portfolio and our results of operations. in addition, our commercial bank's strategy includes an industry-specific focus. if any of the industries that we focus in experience changes, we may experience increased credit losses and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
we may experience increased losses associated with mortgage repurchases and indemnification obligations.
certain of our subsidiaries, including greenpoint mortgage funding, inc. ("greenpoint"), capital one home loans, llc and capital one, n.a., as successor to chevy chase bank ("ccb"), may be required to repurchase mortgage loans that have been
18      capital one financial corporation (cof)
sold to investors in the event there are breaches of certain representations and warranties contained within the sales agreements. we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans that we sell to investors in the event that there was improper underwriting or fraud or in the event that the loans become delinquent shortly after they are originated. these subsidiaries also may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur in the event of breaches of representations and warranties and in various other circumstances, including securities fraud or other public disclosure-related claims, and the amount of such losses could exceed the repurchase amount of the related loans. consequently, we may be exposed to credit risk associated with sold loans.
we have established reserves in our consolidated financial statements for potential losses that are considered to be both probable and reasonably estimable related to the mortgage loans sold by our originating subsidiaries. the adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred will depend on, among other things, the actual future mortgage loan performance, the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests, the actual success rate of claimants, developments in litigation and the regulatory environment related to us and the industry, actual recoveries on the collateral, and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). due to uncertainties relating to these factors, there can be no assurance that our reserves will be adequate or that the total amount of losses incurred will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. for additional information related to our mortgage loan repurchase and indemnification obligations and related reserves and our estimate of the reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond the current accrual levels as of december 31, 2014, see "note 20-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others."
we may not be able to maintain adequate capital or liquidity levels, which could have a negative impact on our financial results.
as a result of the dodd-frank act and international accords, financial institutions are becoming subject to new and increased capital and liquidity requirements. although u.s. regulators have finalized regulations for some of these requirements, there remains continued uncertainty as to the form the additional new requirements will take or how and when they will apply to us. as a result, it is possible that we could be required to increase our capital and/or liquidity levels above the levels assumed in our current financial plans. these new requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to lend, grow deposit balances or make acquisitions and limit our ability to make capital distributions in the form of dividends or share repurchases. higher capital levels also lower our return on equity.
in addition, as described further below, for regulatory capital purposes we entered parallel run on january 1, 2015 and, therefore, could become subject to the basel iii advanced approaches framework as early as january 1, 2016 for purposes of determining our regulatory capital requirements. although we have current estimates of risk-weighted asset calculations under that framework, there remains uncertainty around future regulatory interpretations of certain aspects of those calculations. therefore, we cannot assure you that our current estimates will be correct, and we may need to hold significantly more regulatory capital in the future than we currently estimate to maintain a given capital ratio.
recent developments in capital and liquidity requirements that we expect will impact us include the following:
•   in december 2010, the basel committee published a final framework on capital and in january 2013 published a revised framework on liquidity, together commonly known as basel iii. in july 2013, u.s. banking regulators finalized rules implementing the basel iii capital framework and other capital requirements, including pursuant to the dodd-frank act (the "final basel iii capital rules"). among other things, the final basel iii capital rules: increase the general risk-based and leverage capital requirements; significantly revise the definition of regulatory capital, including by eliminating certain items that previously constituted regulatory capital; establish a minimum common equity tier 1 capital requirement; introduce a new capital conservation buffer requirement; and update the prompt corrective action framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums.
•   under the final basel iii capital rules, institutions like the company and the banks are subject to a standardized approach and an advanced approaches capital framework. for advanced approaches institutions like us, the final basel iii capital rules also included a supplementary leverage ratio based upon the basel committee leverage ratio. in september 2014, u.s. banking regulators issued a final rule that revised the supplementary leverage ratio consistent with revisions made by the basel committee, including by modifying the methodology for including off-balance sheet items in the denominator of the supplementary leverage ratio and by requiring institutions to calculate total leverage exposure using daily averages for on-balance sheet items and the average of three month-end calculations for off-balance sheet items. the supplementary leverage ratio will become effective january 1, 2018.
19      capital one financial corporation (cof)
•   as a financial institution with consolidated assets of more than $250 billion, we became subject to the advanced approaches framework at the end of 2012. prior to full implementation of the advanced approaches framework, an organization must complete a qualification period of four consecutive quarters, known as the parallel run, during which it must meet the requirements of the rules to the satisfaction of its primary u.s. banking regulator. we entered parallel run on january 1, 2015. compliance with the advanced approaches rules will require a significant investment of resources.
•   in september 2014, the federal banking agencies issued final rules implementing the basel iii liquidity coverage ratio in the united states (the "final lcr rule"). the final lcr rule will require the company and each of the banks to hold an amount of eligible high-quality, liquid assets that equals or exceeds 100% of each institution's respective projected net cash outflows over a 30-day period, each as calculated in accordance with the final lcr rule. we have been modifying the composition of our investment portfolio in preparation for the final lcr rule, with some of these actions resulting in us purchasing types of securities that are lower yielding than securities we would otherwise be purchasing if not for the final lcr rule.
•   because we are a bank holding company with consolidated assets of more than $50 billion, we are subject to certain heightened prudential standards under the dodd-frank act, including requirements that may be recommended by the financial stability oversight council and implemented by the federal reserve. as a result, we expect to be subject to more stringent standards and requirements than those applicable for smaller institutions, including risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits and liquidity requirements. in december 2011, the federal reserve released proposed rules beginning to implement the enhanced prudential requirements, including a detailed liquidity framework that would supplement the liquidity regulations implementing basel iii. the federal reserve finalized certain of the proposed rules on february 18, 2014 ("enhanced standards rule"). under the enhanced standards rule, we must meet liquidity risk management standards, conduct internal liquidity stress tests, and maintain a 30-day buffer of highly liquid assets to cover cash-flow needs under stressed conditions, in each case consistent with the requirements of the rule.
•   under the federal reserve's capital plan rule, bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and must obtain approval from the federal reserve before making most capital distributions, such as dividends and share repurchases, in a process commonly referred to as ccar. as part of its evaluation of a capital plan, the federal reserve will consider the comprehensiveness of the plan, the reasonableness of assumptions and analysis and methodologies used to assess capital adequacy, and other qualitative factors at the discretion of the federal reserve. furthermore, the federal reserve will consider our ability to maintain capital ratios above each basel iii minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a tier 1 common ratio of 5.0% on a pro forma basis under baseline and stressed conditions throughout a planning horizon of at least nine quarters. in the 2015 capital plan and stress test cycles, we will be required to meet basel iii standardized approach capital requirements, with appropriate phase-in provisions. on october 17, 2014, the federal reserve issued a final rule regarding the capital plan and stress test rules that, among other things, limits the ability of a bank holding company with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets to make capital distributions under the capital plan rule if the bank holding company's net capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in its capital plan.
•   we consider various factors in the management of capital, including the impact of stress on our capital levels, as determined by both our internal modeling and the federal reserve's modeling of our capital position in ccar. in recent stress test cycles, including ccar, we have observed a large difference between our estimates of our capital levels under stress and the federal reserve's estimates of our capital levels under stress. in the current stress test cycle, including ccar, the difference could be larger because we expect the federal reserve to continue to use its own assumptions in modeling results. therefore, although our estimated capital levels under stress suggest that we have substantial capacity to return capital to shareholders and remain well capitalized under stress, it is possible that the federal reserve's modeling may result in a materially lower capacity to return capital to shareholders than our estimates.
see "item 1. business-supervision and regulation" for additional information.
we face risk related to our operational, technological and organizational infrastructure.
our ability to grow and compete is dependent on our ability to build or acquire necessary operational, technological and organizational infrastructure. we are embedding technology, data, and software development deeply into our business model and how we work. we are focused on building reusable plug-and-play middleware, developing and designing modern software, integrating our platforms and making them scalable, and building a powerful and flexible data infrastructure. for example, we have substantially completed significant development projects to achieve the systems integration of prior acquisitions and to build
20      capital one financial corporation (cof)
a scalable infrastructure in our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses. we have also invested in infrastructure in the commercial banking business intended to assist with effective execution of key processes and improve loan origination and underwriting platforms. in the credit card business, we have invested in our infrastructure in order to consolidate and simplify system and portfolio conversions.
in addition, our businesses are dependent on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of complex transactions. if any of our financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be materially adversely affected. third parties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk, particularly in the event of breakdowns or failures of such parties' own systems. we may also be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which may include, for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages, cyber-attacks, including ddos discussed below, natural disasters, other damage to property or physical assets or events arising from local or larger scale politics, including terrorist acts. any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate our businesses, service customer accounts, and protect customers' information, or result in potential liability to customers, reputational damage, regulatory intervention and customers' loss of confidence in our businesses, any of which could result in a material adverse effect.
similar to other large corporations, we are exposed to operational risk that can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, inaccurate models, faulty or disabled computer systems, fraud by employees or persons outside of our company and exposure to external events. in addition, we are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems which we use to manage our internal financial and other systems, interface with our customers and develop and implement effective marketing campaigns. we also depend on models to measure risks, estimate certain financial values, determine pricing on certain products, assess capital adequacy and calculate regulatory capital levels. if we implement or design our models poorly or use inaccurate assumptions in our models, business decisions based on the output of the models may be adversely affected. moreover, information we disclose to investors and our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate. some decisions our regulators make, including those related to our capital distribution plans, may be adversely impacted if they perceive the quality of our models to be insufficient.
our ability to develop and deliver new products that meet the needs of our existing customers and attract new ones and to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations depends on the functionality and reliability of our operational and technology systems. any disruptions, failures or inaccuracies of our operational and technology systems and models, including those associated with improvements or modifications to such systems and models, could cause us to be unable to market and manage our products and services, manage our risk or to report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner, all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
in some cases, we outsource the maintenance and development of operational and technological functionality to third parties. these third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control. any increase in the amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to third parties may increase our exposure to these risks.
our ongoing investments in infrastructure, which are necessary to maintain a competitive business, integrate acquisitions and establish scalable operations, may increase our expenses. further, as our business develops, changes or expands, additional expenses can arise as a result of a reevaluation of business strategies, management of outsourced services, asset purchases or other acquisitions, structural reorganization, compliance with new laws or regulations or the integration of newly acquired businesses. as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may also be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or strengthen our protective security measures, investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities of our information systems and infrastructure or invest in new technology designed to mitigate security risks. if we are unable to successfully manage our expenses, our financial results will be negatively affected.
we could incur increased costs or reductions in revenue or suffer reputational damage and business disruptions in the event of the theft, loss or misuse of information, including as a result of a cyber-attack.
our products and services involve the gathering, storage and transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers and their accounts. our ability to provide such products and services, many of which are web-based, relies upon the management and safeguarding of information, software, methodologies and business secrets. to provide these products and services, we use information systems and infrastructure that we and third-party service providers operate. we also have arrangements in place with retail partners and other third parties where we share and receive information about their customers who are or may become our customers. as a financial institution, we also are subject to and examined for compliance with an array of data protection laws,
21      capital one financial corporation (cof)
regulations and guidance, as well as to our own internal privacy and information security policies and programs. if our information systems or infrastructure experience a significant disruption or breach, it could lead, depending on the nature of the disruption or breach, to unauthorized access to personal or confidential information of our customers in our possession or unauthorized access to our proprietary information, software, methodologies and business secrets. in addition, if our partners, retailers or other market participants experience a disruption or breach, depending on the nature of the disruption or breach, it could lead to unauthorized transactions on capital one accounts or unauthorized access to personal or confidential information maintained by those entities. a disruption or breach such as these could result in significant legal and financial exposure, regulatory intervention, remediation costs, card reissuance, supervisory liability, damage to our reputation or loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products and services that could adversely affect our business.
information security risks for large financial institutions like us have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, activists, formal and informal instrumentalities of foreign governments and other external parties. as noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. our businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software and networks to conduct their operations. in addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use computers, smartphones, tablet pcs and other mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems. although we believe we have a robust suite of authentication and layered information security controls, our technologies, systems, networks and our customers' devices may become the target of cyber-attacks or other attacks that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers' confidential, proprietary or other information, including access to accounts with online functionality, which could result in disruptions and damage to the business operations or finances of capital one, our customers or other third parties. for example, we and other u.s. financial services providers continue to be targeted with evolving and adaptive distributed ddos attacks from sophisticated third parties. ddos attacks are designed to saturate the targeted online network with excessive amounts of network traffic, resulting in slow response times or even causing the site to be temporarily unavailable. on at least one occasion, a ddos attack successfully disrupted our consumer online banking services for a period of time, which had a non-material impact on our business. although we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber incidents, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. if future attacks like these are successful or if customers are unable to access their accounts online for other reasons, it could adversely impact our ability to service customer accounts or loans, complete financial transactions for our customers or otherwise operate any of our businesses or services. in addition, a breach or attack affecting one of our third-party service providers or partners could harm our business even if we do not control the service that is attacked.
because the methods and techniques employed by perpetrators of fraud and others to attack, disable, degrade or sabotage platforms, systems and applications change frequently, are increasingly sophisticated and often are not fully recognized or understood until after they have been launched, we and our third-party service providers and partners may be unable to anticipate certain attack methods in order to implement effective preventative measures. in addition, the increasing prevalence of cyber-attacks and other efforts to breach or disrupt our systems or those of our partners, retailers or other market participants has led, and will likely continue to lead, to increased costs to us with respect to preventing, mitigating and remediating these risks, as well as any related attempted fraud. for example, various retailers have recently been victims of cyber-attacks in which customer data, including debit and credit card information, was obtained. in these situations, we incur a variety of costs, including those associated with replacing the compromised cards and remediating fraudulent transaction activity. further, successful cyber-attacks at other large financial institutions or other market participants, whether or not we are impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our financial products. though we have insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks, it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event.
we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our mergers, acquisitions and strategic partnerships.
we have engaged in merger and acquisition activity and entered into strategic partnerships over the past several years and may continue to engage in such activity in the future. we continue to evaluate and anticipate engaging in, among other merger and acquisition activity, additional strategic partnerships and selected acquisitions of financial institutions and other financial assets, including credit card and other loan portfolios.
any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership we undertake will entail certain risks, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations. if we experience greater than anticipated costs to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or are not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership, including cost savings and other synergies, our business could be negatively affected. in addition, it is possible that the ongoing integration processes could
22      capital one financial corporation (cof)
result in the loss of key employees, errors or delays in systems implementation, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with partners, clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership. integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources. these integration matters may have an adverse effect on us during any transition period.
in addition, we may face the following risks in connection with any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership:
•   new businesses and geographic or other markets: our merger, acquisition or strategic partnership activity may involve our entry into new businesses and new geographic areas or other markets which present risks resulting from our relative inexperience in these new businesses or markets. these new businesses or markets may change the overall character of our consolidated portfolio of businesses and could react differently to economic and other external factors. we face the risk that we will not be successful in these new businesses or in these new markets.
•   identification and assessment of merger and acquisition targets and deployment of acquired assets: we cannot assure you that we will identify or acquire suitable financial assets or institutions to supplement our organic growth through acquisitions or strategic partnerships. in addition, we may incorrectly assess the asset quality and value of the particular assets or institutions we acquire. further, our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership will depend on our ability to assess the asset quality and value of the particular assets or institutions we partner with, merge with or acquire. we may be unable to profitably deploy any assets we acquire.
•   accuracy of assumptions: in connection with any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership, we may make certain assumptions relating to the proposed merger, acquisition or strategic partnership that may be, or may prove to be, inaccurate, including as a result of the failure to realize the expected benefits of any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership. the inaccuracy of any assumptions we may make could result in unanticipated consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. assumptions we might make when considering a proposed merger, acquisition or strategic partnership may relate to numerous matters, including:
•   projections of a target or partner company's future net income and our earnings per share;
•   our ability to issue equity and debt to complete any merger or acquisition;
•   our expected capital structure and capital ratios after any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership;
•   projections as to the amount of future loan losses in any target or partner company's portfolio;
•   the amount of goodwill and intangibles that will result from any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership;
•   certain purchase accounting adjustments that we expect will be recorded in our financial statements in connection with any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership;
•   cost, deposit, cross-selling and balance sheet synergies in connection with any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership;
•   merger, acquisition or strategic partnership costs, including restructuring charges and transaction costs;
•   our ability to maintain, develop and deepen relationships with customers of a target or partner company;
•   our ability to grow a target or partner company's customer deposits and manage a target or partner company's assets and liabilities;
•   higher than expected transaction and integration costs and unknown liabilities as well as general economic and business conditions that adversely affect the combined company following any merger or acquisition transaction;
•   the extent and nature of regulatory oversight over a target or partner company;
•   projected or expected tax benefits or assets;
23      capital one financial corporation (cof)
•   accounting matters related to the target or partner company, including accuracy of assumptions and estimates used in preparation of financial statements such as those used to determine allowance for loan losses, fair value of certain assets and liabilities, securities impairment and realization of deferred tax assets; and
•   our expectations regarding macroeconomic conditions, including the unemployment rate, housing prices, the interest rate environment, the shape of the yield curve, inflation and other economic indicators; and other financial and strategic risks associated with any merger or acquisition.
•   target specific risk: assets and companies that we acquire, or companies that we enter into strategic partnerships with, will have their own risks that are specific to a particular asset or company. these risks include, but are not limited to, particular or specific regulatory, accounting, operational, reputational and industry risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. indemnification rights, if any, may be insufficient to compensate us for any losses or damages resulting from such risks. in addition to regulatory approvals discussed above, certain of our merger, acquisition or partnership activity may require third-party consents in order for us to fully realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction.
reputational risk and social factors may impact our results and damage our brand.
our ability to originate and maintain accounts is highly dependent upon the perceptions of consumer and commercial borrowers and deposit holders and other external perceptions of our business practices or our financial health. in addition, our brand has historically been, and we expect it to continue to be, very important to us. maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide high-quality products and services. adverse perceptions regarding our reputation in the consumer, commercial and funding markets could lead to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them. in particular, negative public perceptions regarding our reputation could lead to decreases in the levels of deposits that consumer and commercial customers and potential customers choose to maintain with us. in addition, negative perceptions regarding certain industries or clients could also prompt us to cease business activities associated with those industries or clients. negative public opinion or damage to our brand could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including lending practices, regulatory compliance, security breaches (including the use and protection of customer information), corporate governance, and sales and marketing, and from actions taken by regulators or other persons in response to such conduct. in addition, third parties with whom we have important relationships may take actions over which we have limited control that could negatively impact perceptions about us.
in addition, a variety of social factors may cause changes in borrowing activity, including credit card use, payment patterns and the rate of defaults by accountholders and borrowers domestically and internationally. these social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels, the public's perception regarding consumer debt, including credit card use, and changing attitudes about the stigma of bankruptcy. if consumers develop or maintain negative attitudes about incurring debt, or if consumption trends decline or if we fail to maintain and enhance our brand, or we incur significant expenses in this effort, our business and financial results could be materially and negatively affected.
we face intense competition in all of our markets.
we operate in a highly competitive environment, and we expect competitive conditions to continue to intensify. we face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. we compete on the basis of the rates we pay on deposits and the rates and other terms we charge on the loans we originate or purchase, as well as the quality of our customer service and experience. price competition for loans might result in origination of fewer loans or earning less on our loans. we expect that competition will continue to increase with respect to most of our products. some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, which may give those competitors advantages, including a more diversified product and customer base, the ability to reach out to more customers and potential customers, operational efficiencies, more versatile technology platforms, broad-based local distribution capabilities, lower-cost funding and larger existing branch networks. in addition, some of our competitors, including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject, which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage.
many of our competitors are focusing on cross-selling their products and developing new products or technologies, which could affect our ability to maintain or grow existing customer relationships or require us to offer lower interest rates or fees on our lending products or higher interest rates on deposits. this increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation,
24      capital one financial corporation (cof)
changes in technology and product delivery systems, as well as the consolidation of financial service providers, all of which may affect our customers' expectations and demands.
we operate the largest online direct banking institution in the u.s. by deposits. while direct banking represents a significant opportunity to attract new customers that value greater and more flexible access to banking services at reduced costs, it also presents significant risks and we face strong competition in the direct banking market. aggressive pricing throughout the industry may adversely affect the retention of existing balances and the cost-efficient acquisition of new deposit funds and may affect our growth and profitability. in addition, the effects of a competitive environment may be exacerbated by the flexibility of direct banking and the increasing financial and technological sophistication of our customer base. customers could also close their online accounts or reduce balances or deposits in favor of products and services offered by competitors for other reasons. these shifts, which could be rapid, could result from general dissatisfaction with our products or services, including concerns over pricing, online security or our reputation.
we have significantly expanded our credit card partnership business over the past several years with the additions of a number of credit card partnerships. the market for key business partners, especially in the credit card business, is very competitive, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships. we face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources, time and expense into acquiring and developing the relationships. the loss of any of our business partners could have a negative impact on our results of operations, including lower returns, excess operating expense and excess funding capacity.
in such a competitive environment, we may lose entire accounts or may lose account balances to competing firms, or we may find it more costly to maintain our existing customer base. customer attrition from any or all of our lending products, together with any lowering of interest rates or fees that we might implement to retain customers, could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings. similarly, unexpected customer attrition from our deposit products, in addition to an increase in rates or services that we may offer to retain those deposits, may increase our expenses and therefore reduce our earnings.
if we do not adjust to rapid changes in the financial services industry, our financial performance may suffer.
our ability to deliver to stockholders strong financial performance and returns on investment will depend in part on our ability to expand the scope of available financial services to meet the needs and demands of our customers, including by marketing new products to our customer base. our ability to meet our customers' needs and expectations is key to our ability to grow revenue and earnings.
we expect digital technologies to have a significant impact on banking over time. consumers increasingly expect robust digital experiences from their financial services providers. the ability for customers to access their accounts and conduct financial transactions using digital technology, including mobile applications, is an increasingly important aspect of the financial services industry and it impacts our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. to that end, financial institutions are rapidly introducing new digital and other technology-driven products and services, which aim to offer a better customer experience and to reduce costs. we continue to invest in digital technology designed to attract new customers, facilitate the ability of existing customers to conduct financial transactions and enhance the customer experience related to our products and services. our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using digital technology to provide products and services that efficiently meet their expectations in a cost-effective manner. the development and launch of new digital products and services depends in large part on our capacity to invest in and build the technology platforms that can enable them. we continue to actively invest in such technology platforms, however, we may fail to implement the correct technology, or may fail to do so in a timely manner as discussed in more detail below under the heading "we face risk related to our operational, technological and organizational infrastructure." as noted above, some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, which may allow those competitors to invest more money into their technology infrastructure and digital innovation than we do. in addition, we face intense competition from smaller companies which experience lower cost structures and different regulatory requirements than we do, and which may allow them to innovate more rapidly than we can. further, our success depends on our ability to attract and retain strong digital and technology leaders, engineers and other talent, and competition for such talent is intense. if we are unable to attract and retain digital and technology talent, our ability to offer digital products and services and build the necessary technology infrastructure could be negatively affected, which could negatively impact our business and financial results. a failure to maintain or enhance our competitive position with respect to digital products and services, whether because we fail to anticipate customer expectations or because our technological developments fail to perform as desired or are not implemented in a timely or successful manner, could negatively impact our business and financial results.

fluctuations in market interest rates or volatility in the capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, our cost of capital or our liquidity.
like other financial institutions, our business may be sensitive to market interest rate movement and the performance of the capital markets. changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us. for example, we borrow money from other institutions and depositors, which we use to make loans to customers and invest in debt securities and other earning assets. we earn interest on these loans and assets and pay interest on the money we borrow from institutions and depositors. fluctuations in interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term rates and long-term rates and in the relationship between our funding basis rate and our lending basis rate, may have negative impacts on our net interest income and therefore our earnings. in addition, interest rate fluctuations and competitor responses to those changes may affect the rate of customer prepayments for mortgage, auto and other term loans and may affect the balances customers carry on their credit cards. these changes can reduce the overall yield on our earning asset portfolio. changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain balances in the deposit accounts they have with us. in addition, changes in valuations in the debt and equity markets could have a negative impact on the assets we hold in our investment portfolio. such market changes could also have a negative impact on the valuation of assets for which we provide servicing. finally, the final rule requires that most amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci"), including unrealized gains and losses on securities designated as available for sale, be included in our regulatory capital calculations. changes in interest rates or market valuations that result in unrealized losses on components of aoci could therefore impact our regulatory capital ratios negatively.
we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction and the magnitude of interest rate changes. we take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments. we face the risk that changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our earnings, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than those we assumed. see "md&a-market risk management" for additional information.
our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate skilled senior leaders.
our success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain key senior leaders, and competition for such senior leaders is intense. the executive compensation provisions of the dodd-frank act and the regulations issued thereunder, and any further legislation, regulation or regulatory guidance restricting executive compensation, may limit the types of compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our most senior leaders and could have a negative impact on our ability to attract, retain and motivate such leaders in support of our long-term strategy. these laws and regulations may not apply in the same manner to all financial institutions, and we therefore may face more restrictions than other institutions and companies with whom we compete for talent. if we are unable to retain talented senior leadership, our business could be negatively affected.
our businesses are subject to the risk of increased litigation.
our businesses are subject to increased litigation risks as a result of a number of factors and from various sources, including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry, the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry, the structure of the credit card industry and business practices in the mortgage lending business. given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us, there can be significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation matters. the finding, or even the assertion, of substantial legal liability against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and could cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously harm our business.
we face risks from unpredictable catastrophic events.
despite our substantial business contingency plans, the impact from natural disasters and other catastrophic events, including terrorist attacks, may have a negative effect on our business and infrastructure, including our information technology systems. in addition, if a natural disaster or other catastrophic event occurs in certain regions where our business and customers are concentrated, such as the mid-atlantic and new york metropolitan area, we could be disproportionately impacted as compared to our competitors. the impact of such events and other catastrophes on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
26      capital one financial corporation (cof)
we face risks from the use of or changes to estimates in our financial statements.
pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. ("u.s. gaap"), we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including, but not limited to, estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. in addition, the fasb, the sec and other regulatory bodies may change the financial accounting and reporting standards, including those related to assumptions and estimates we use to prepare our financial statements, in ways that we cannot predict and that could impact our financial statements. if actual results differ from the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements or if financial accounting and reporting standards are changed, we may experience unexpected material losses. for a discussion of our use of estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies."
our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends and repurchase common stock.
we are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries, including the banks. dividends to us from our direct and indirect subsidiaries, including the banks, have represented a major source of funds for us to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock, repurchase common stock, make payments on corporate debt securities and meet other obligations. there are various federal law limitations on the extent to which the banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to us through dividends and loans. these limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements, federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus, sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and regulation w governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates, as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices. if our subsidiaries' earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, our liquidity may be affected and we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common or preferred stockholders, repurchase our common stock, make payments on outstanding corporate debt securities or meet other obligations, each and any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or perception of financial health.
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.
our ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the stability and actions of other financial services institutions. financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, servicing, counterparty and other relationships. we have exposure to an increasing number of financial institutions and counterparties. these counterparties include institutions that may be exposed to various risks over which we have little or no control, including european or u.s. sovereign debt that is currently or may become in the future subject to significant price pressure, rating agency downgrade or default risk.
in addition, we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients, resulting in a significant credit concentration with respect to the financial services industry overall. as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.
likewise, adverse developments affecting the overall strength and soundness of our competitors, the financial services industry as a whole and the general economic climate or sovereign debt could have a negative impact on perceptions about the strength and soundness of our business even if we are not subject to the same adverse developments. in addition, adverse developments with respect to third parties with whom we have important relationships also could negatively impact perceptions about us. these perceptions about us could cause our business to be negatively affected and exacerbate the other risks that we face.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a")
this discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon management's current expectations and are subject to significant uncertainties and changes in circumstances. please review "forward-looking statements" for more information on the forward-looking statements in this 2014 annual report on form 10-k ("this report"). our actual results may differ materially from those included in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, those described in "part i-item 1a. risk factors" in this report. unless otherwise specified, references to notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2014 included in this report.
management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. the following md&a is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity by focusing on changes from year to year in certain key measures used by management to evaluate performance, such as profitability, growth and credit quality metrics. md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31, 2014 and accompanying notes. md&a is organized in the following sections:
• executive summary and business outlook                          • capital management
• critical accounting policies and estimates                      • risk management

financial highlights we reported net income of $4.4 billion ($7.59 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $22.3 billion for 2014, with each of our three business segments contributing to our earnings. in comparison, we reported net income of $4.1 billion ($6.89 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $22.4 billion for 2013 and $3.5 billion ($6.11 per diluted share) on total net revenue of $21.4 billion for 2012.
beginning on january 1, 2014, we calculate our regulatory capital under the basel iii standardized approach subject to transition provisions. our common equity tier 1 capital ratio, as calculated under the basel iii standardized approach, including transition provisions, was 12.46% as of december 31, 2014. our tier 1 common ratio, as calculated under basel i, was 12.19% as of december 31, 2013. these numbers are not directly comparable due to methodological differences in the calculation of the ratios. we formally entered parallel run for basel iii advanced approaches as of january 1, 2015. see "capital management" below for additional information.
on march 26, 2014, we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of our common stock ("2014 stock repurchase program"). during 2014, we repurchased approximately $2.0 billion of common stock and expect to complete the 2014 stock repurchase program by the end of the first quarter of 2015. see "capital management" below for additional information.
below are additional highlights of our performance in 2014. these highlights generally are based on a comparison between the results of 2014 and 2013, except as otherwise noted. the changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of december 31, 2014 compared to our financial condition and credit
35      capital one financial corporation (cof)
performance as of december 31, 2013. we provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this "executive summary and business outlook."
total company
•   earnings: our net income increased by $307 million, or 7%, to $4.4 billion in 2014, compared to $4.1 billion in 2013. the increase in net income was driven by (i) a $342 million change driven by a net benefit of $33 million for mortgage representation and warranty losses (which includes a benefit of $26 million before taxes in continuing operations and a benefit of $7 million before taxes in discontinued operations) in 2014, as compared to a net provision of $309 million (which includes a benefit of $24 million before taxes in continuing operations and a provision of $333 million before taxes in discontinued operations) in 2013; (ii) a decrease in non-interest expense due to lower amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related costs and the provision for litigation matters; and (iii) an increase in net interest income due to lower funding costs. these items were partially offset by a decrease in net interest income attributable to the portfolio sale and higher marketing expenses associated with loan growth.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment increased by $11.1 billion, or 6%, to $208.3 billion as of december 31, 2014 from $197.2 billion as of december 31, 2013. average loans held for investment increased by $5.3 billion, or 3%, to $197.9 billion in 2014, compared to $192.6 billion in 2013. the increases were due to growth in our credit card and commercial loan portfolios, and continued strong auto loan originations outpacing the run-off of the acquired home loan portfolio in our consumer banking business.
•   net charge-off and delinquency statistics: our net charge-off rate decreased by 32 basis points to 1.72% in 2014 from 2.04% in 2013. the low net charge-off rates observed during 2014, compared to our historical trends, were largely due to continued economic improvement and portfolio seasoning. our 30+ day delinquency rate declined to 2.91% as of december 31, 2014 from 2.96% as of december 31, 2013. the decrease was primarily due to strong credit performance. we provide additional information on our credit quality metrics below under "business segment financial performance" and "credit risk profile."
•   allowance for loan and lease losses: our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $68 million to $4.4 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $4.3 billion as of december 31, 2013. the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by loan growth in our domestic card, auto and commercial loan portfolios, in addition to portfolio specific risks in our commercial loan portfolio, offset by credit improvement driving allowance releases related to our international card portfolio. the allowance coverage ratio declined by 9 basis points to 2.10% as of december 31, 2014 from 2.19% as of december 31, 2013 primarily resulting from the increase in the outstanding balances in loans held for investment outpacing the allowance build.
•   representation and warranty reserve: the mortgage representation and warranty reserve decreased by $441 million to $731 million as of december 31, 2014, from $1.2 billion as of december 31, 2013. we recorded a net benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses of $33 million (which includes a benefit of $26 million before taxes in continuing operations and a benefit of $7 million before taxes in discontinued operations) in 2014. the decrease in the representation and warranty reserve was primarily driven by claims paid and legal developments including settlements.

(1)   as of january 1, 2014, we adopted the proportional amortization method of accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for additional information. prior periods have been recast to conform to this presentation.
(2)   total net revenue consists of net interest income and non-interest income.
(3)   net income (loss) for our business segments is based on income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax.
(4)   some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our commercial banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35%.
(5)   includes the residual impact of the allocation of certain items, our centralized corporate treasury group activities, as well as other items as described in "note 19-business segments."
•   credit card: our credit card business generated net income from continuing operations of $2.5 billion in 2014, compared to net income from continuing operations of $2.6 billion in 2013. the decrease in net income was driven by lower net revenue associated with the portfolio sale in 2013, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest expenses and a lower provision for credit losses driven by lower net charge-offs. period-end loans held for investment in our credit card business increased by $4.6 billion to $85.9 billion as of december 31, 2014 from $81.3 billion as of december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily due to growth in the domestic card loan portfolio in 2014.
•   consumer banking: our consumer banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $1.2 billion in 2014, compared to net income from continuing operations of $1.5 billion in 2013. the decrease in net income was primarily attributable to compression in deposit spreads in retail banking, declining home loan portfolio balances and margin compression in our auto loan portfolio. the decrease was partially offset by higher net interest income generated by growth in our auto loan portfolio. period-end loans held for investment in our consumer banking business increased by $677 million to $71.4 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $70.8 billion as of december 31, 2013, due to growth in our auto loan portfolio outpacing the run-off in our acquired home loan portfolio.
•   commercial banking: our commercial banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $659 million in 2014, compared to net income from continuing operations of $731 million in 2013. the decrease in net income was primarily due to a higher provision for credit losses, reflecting an allowance build in 2014 compared to an allowance release in 2013. this was partially offset by higher revenue net of related operating expenses, driven by the growth in our commercial loan portfolio, fee-based services and products attributable to the beech street business. period-end loans held for investment in our commercial banking business increased by $5.9 billion to $50.9 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $45.0 billion as of december 31, 2013. the increase was driven by loan growth in the commercial and industrial and commercial and multifamily real estate portfolios.

business outlook we discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of each of our business segments over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time we filed this annual report on form 10-k. the statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies. our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in "part i-item 1. business" and "part ii-item 7. md&a" of this report. certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. except as otherwise disclosed, forward-looking statements do not reflect: (i) any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies; (ii) the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that have not been previously disclosed; or (iii) any changes in laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations, in each case after the date as of which such statements are made. see "part i-item 1. business-forward-looking statements" in this report for more information on the forward-looking statements included in this report and "part i-item 1a. risk factors" in this report for factors that could materially influence our results.
total company expectations our strategies and actions are designed to deliver and sustain strong returns and capital generation through the acquisition and retention of franchise-enhancing customer relationships across our businesses. we believe that franchise-enhancing customer relationships create and sustain significant long-term value through low risk-adjusted credit costs, long and loyal customer relationships and a gradual build in loan balances and revenues over time. examples of franchise-enhancing customer relationships include rewards customers and partnerships in our credit card business, retail deposit customers in our consumer banking business and primary banking relationships with commercial customers in our commercial banking business. we intend to grow these customer relationships by continuing to invest in scalable infrastructure and operating platforms, so that we can meet the heightened risk management expectations facing all banks and deliver a "brand-defining" customer experience that builds and sustains a valuable, long-term customer franchise.
we delivered attractive risk-adjusted returns in 2014, and we expect that will continue. in 2015, we expect growth in full-year revenues, driven by growth in average loans. we also expect that full-year marketing and operating expenses will both be higher in 2015 than they were in 2014. we expect the full-year 2015 efficiency ratio to be between 53.5% and 54.5%, excluding non-recurring items. we also expect that efficiency ratio will vary, perhaps significantly, from quarter to quarter based on factors such as day count, the timing of growth and associated revenues, and the timing of investments throughout the year.
we believe our actions have created a well-positioned balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity. pursuant to our approved 2014 capital plan, we expect to complete our previously announced $2.5 billion 2014 stock repurchase program in the first quarter of 2015.
the timing and exact amount of any common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, our capital position and amount of our retained earnings. our 2014 stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. see "md&a-capital management-capital planning and regulatory stress testing" for more information.
business segment expectations
•   credit card: in our domestic card business, we continue to expect the quarterly charge-off rate throughout 2015 to be in the mid-to-high three percent range. we expect normal seasonal patterns throughout the year, including an increase in the charge-off rate in the first quarter of 2015, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. in addition to seasonality, we continue to expect that loan growth will impact the charge-off rate. as new loan balances season, we expect them to put upward pressure on losses. while this impact on the charge-off rate will likely be modest at first, we expect that the impact will grow throughout 2015 and beyond. in addition to rising charge-offs, we expect loan growth to drive allowance additions. we continue to believe that our domestic card business continues to be well-positioned.
•   consumer banking: in our consumer banking business, we continue to experience a change in product mix as a result of continued growth in auto originations and loans offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio. while our auto business remains well-positioned, we remain cautious and continue to closely monitor pricing, underwriting
38      capital one financial corporation (cof)
practices, used vehicle prices and other competitor and market factors. returns on new auto originations are lower than returns in the overall auto loan portfolio, but remain resilient and within ranges that support an attractive business. in addition, in our retail banking business, we expect the impact of the prolonged low interest rate environment will continue to pressure returns, even if rates rise in 2015.
•   commercial banking: our commercial banking business is well-positioned to navigate current market conditions. competition in the commercial banking business remains intense, pressuring margin and returns. although we expect the pace of our commercial loan portfolio growth to be slower in 2015, we expect our commercial banking business to continue to deliver solid results.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. we provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies."
we have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. these critical accounting policies govern:
•   loan loss reserves
•   asset impairment
•   fair value of financial instruments
•   representation and warranty reserves
•   customer rewards reserves we evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them, as necessary, based on changing conditions. management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors.
loan loss reserves we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses that represents management's estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our held-for-investment credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking loan portfolios as of each balance sheet date. we also separately reserve for binding unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees.
we build our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments through the provision for credit losses. our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by charge-offs, changes to allowance for loan and lease losses, and changes to unfunded lending commitments. we recorded a provision for credit losses of $3.5 billion in both 2014 and 2013, and $4.4 billion in 2012.
we have an established process, using analytical tools and management judgment, to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses. losses are inherent in our loan portfolio and we calculate the allowance for loan and lease losses by estimating incurred losses for segments of our loan portfolio with similar risk characteristics and record a provision for credit losses. the allowance totaled $4.4 billion as of december 31, 2014, compared to $4.3 billion as of december 31, 2013.
we review and assess our allowance methodologies and adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a quarterly basis. our assessment involves evaluating many factors including, but not limited to, historical loss and recovery experience, recent trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, risk ratings, the impact of bankruptcy filings, the value of collateral underlying secured loans, account seasoning, changes in our credit evaluation, underwriting and collection management policies, seasonality, general economic conditions, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques
39      capital one financial corporation (cof)
used in estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses. key factors that have a significant impact on our allowance for loan and lease losses include assumptions about unemployment rates, home prices, and the valuation of commercial properties and other collateral, consumer real estate, and automobiles.
in addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we review and assess our estimate of probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit and financial guarantees, and unfunded loan commitments on a quarterly basis.  the factors impacting our assessment generally align with those considered in our evaluation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial banking business. changes to the reserve for losses on unfunded lending commitments are recorded through the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income and to other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
although we examine a variety of externally available data, as well as our internal loan performance data, to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments, our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties, including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance. accordingly, our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations. we provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies." we provide information on the components of our allowance, disaggregated by impairment methodology, and changes in our allowance in "note 5-allowance for loan and lease losses."
finance charge and fee reserves finance charges and fees on credit card loans, net of amounts that we consider uncollectible, are included in loan receivables and revenue when the finance charges and fees are earned. we continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged-off; however, when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees, we reduce the balance of our credit card loan receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue. total net revenue was reduced by $645 million, $796 million and $937 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees. the finance charge and fee reserve totaled $216 million as of december 31, 2014, compared to $190 million as of december 31, 2013.
we review and assess the adequacy of the uncollectible finance charge and fee reserve on a quarterly basis. our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred losses on the principal portion of our credit card loan receivables.
asset impairment in addition to our loan portfolio, we review other assets for impairment on a regular basis in accordance with applicable impairment accounting guidance. this process requires significant management judgment and involves various estimates and assumptions. our investment securities, goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets excluding loans. accordingly, below we describe our process for assessing impairment of these assets and the key estimates and assumptions involved in this process.
investment securities we regularly review our investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment ("otti") using both quantitative and qualitative criteria. if we intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in earnings. if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists. our evaluation requires significant management judgment and a consideration of many factors, including, but not limited to, the extent and duration of the impairment; the health of and specific prospects for the issuer, including whether the issuer has failed to make scheduled interest or principal payments; recent events specific to the issuer and/or industry to which the issuer belongs; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings; the value of underlying collateral and current market conditions. quantitative criteria include assessing whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. see "note 3-investment securities" for additional information.

goodwill and intangible assets goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to january 1, 2009 represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. goodwill resulting from business combinations after january 1, 2009, is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.
goodwill totaled $14.0 billion as of both december 31, 2014 and 2013. intangible assets, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets, consist primarily of purchased credit card relationships ("pccr") and core deposit intangibles. the net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased to $1.3 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2013. goodwill and intangible assets together represented 5% of our total assets as of both december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we did not recognize impairment on goodwill or intangible assets in 2014, 2013 or 2012.
goodwill goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, on an annual basis or in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below. the goodwill impairment test, performed at october 1 of each year, is a two-step test. the first step identifies whether there is potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of any potential impairment loss.
estimating the fair value of reporting units and the assets, liabilities and intangible assets of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments. the fair value of reporting units is calculated using a discounted cash flow model, a form of the income approach. the model uses projected cash flows based on each reporting unit's internal forecast and use the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. these cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using discount rates based on our external cost of equity with adjustments for risk inherent in each reporting unit. cash flows are adjusted, as necessary, in order to maintain each reporting unit's equity capital requirements. our discounted cash flow analysis requires management to make judgments about future loan and deposit growth, revenue growth, credit losses, and capital rates. discount rates used in 2014 for the reporting units ranged from 8% to 13%. the key inputs into the discounted cash flow analysis were consistent with market data, where available, indicating that assumptions used were within a reasonable range of observable market data.
we do not maintain separate balance sheets at the reporting unit level; therefore, we calculate the carrying amounts of our reporting units using an allocated capital approach based on each reporting unit's specific regulatory capital, economic capital requirements, and underlying risks. we compare the total reporting unit carrying amounts to our total consolidated stockholders' equity, as discussed further in "note 7-goodwill and intangible assets," to assess the appropriateness of our methodology. if the second step of goodwill impairment testing is required for a reporting unit, we undertake an extensive effort to build the specific reporting unit's balance sheet for the test based on applicable accounting guidance. based on our analysis, the current fair value exceeded the carrying amount of all reporting units as of our annual testing date; therefore, the second step of impairment testing was unnecessary.
as part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we also assessed our market capitalization based on the average market price relative to the aggregate fair value of our reporting units and determined any excess fair value in our reporting units at the date of testing. the excess fair value attributed to a reasonable control premium was compared to historical control premiums seen in the industry.
intangible assets intangible assets with definitive useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives and evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's or asset group's carrying value may not be fully recoverable. an impairment loss, generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. see "note 7-goodwill and intangible assets" for additional information.

mortgage servicing rights mortgage servicing rights ("msr") are initially recorded at fair value when mortgage loans are sold or securitized in the secondary market and the right to service these loans is retained for a fee. subsequently, our consumer msrs are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recognized in non-interest income. our commercial msrs are subsequently measured under the amortization method and are periodically evaluated for impairment, which is recognized as a reduction in non-interest income. see "note 7-goodwill and intangible assets" and "note 18-fair value measurement" for additional information.
fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date (also referred to as an exit price). the fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. this hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2: observable market-based inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 3: unobservable inputs the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters. when quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. changes in market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value.
we have developed policies and procedures to determine when markets for our financial assets and liabilities are inactive if the level and volume of activity has declined significantly relative to normal conditions. if markets are determined to be inactive, it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received. when significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs.
significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are classified as level 2 or level 3. in making this determination, we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the level 3 inputs to the instruments' fair value measurement in its entirety. if level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as level 3. the process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions.
our financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis represented approximately 13% and 14% of our total assets as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. financial assets for which the fair value was determined using significant level 3 inputs represented approximately 4% and 8% of these financial instruments as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
we discuss changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our financial instruments, including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable inputs to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these inputs, in "note 18-fair value measurement."
fair value measurement we have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results. groups independent from our trading and investing functions, including our corporate
42      capital one financial corporation (cof)
valuations group ("cvg"), fair value committee ("fvc") and model validation group, participate in the review and validation process. the fair valuation governance process is set up in a manner that allows the chairperson of the fvc to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved at the fvc to a more senior committee called the valuations advisory committee ("vac") for resolution. the vac is chaired by the chief financial officer and includes other senior management. the vac is only required to convene to review escalated valuation disputes; however, it met once during 2014 for a general update on the valuation process.
the cvg performs periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable. for example, in cases where we rely on third party pricing services to obtain fair value measures, we analyze pricing variances among different pricing sources and validate the final price used by comparing the information to additional sources, including dealer pricing indications in transaction results and other internal sources, where necessary. additional validation procedures performed by the cvg include reviewing (either directly or indirectly through the reasonableness of assigned fair values) valuation inputs and assumptions, and monitoring acceptable variances between recommended prices and validation prices. the cvg and the trade analytics and valuation team ("tav") perform due diligence reviews of the third party pricing services by comparing their prices with prices from other sources and reviewing other control documentation. additionally, when necessary, the cvg and tav challenge prices from third-party vendors to ensure reasonableness of prices through a pricing challenge process. this may include a request for a transparency of the assumptions used by the third party.
the fvc, which includes representation from business areas, our risk management division and our finance division, is a forum for discussing fair market valuations, inputs, assumptions, methodologies, variance thresholds, valuation control environment and material risks or concerns related to fair market valuations. additionally, the fvc is empowered to resolve valuation disputes between the primary valuation providers and the cvg. it provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. the fvc regularly reviews and approves our valuation methodologies to ensure that our methodologies and practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance. the chief financial officer determines when material issues or concerns regarding valuations shall be raised to the audit committee or other delegated committee of the board of directors.
we have a model policy, established by an independent model risk office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing. the model validation group is part of the model risk office and validates all models and provides ongoing monitoring of their performance, including the validation and monitoring of the performance of all valuation models.
representation and warranty reserve in connection with their sales of mortgage loans, certain subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loan's compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance, and the loan's compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. we may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan, indemnify the investor or insurer, or reimburse the investor for loan and lease losses incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of contractual representations or warranties.
we have established representation and warranty reserves for losses that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities. the reserve-setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires the application of judgment. in establishing the representation and warranty reserves, we rely on historical data and consider a variety of factors, depending on the category of purchaser. these factors include, but are not limited to, the historical relationship between loan losses and repurchase outcomes; the percentage of current and future loan defaults that we anticipate will result in repurchase requests over the lifetime of the loans; the percentage of those repurchase requests that we anticipate will result in actual repurchases; and estimated collateral valuations. we evaluate these factors and update our loss forecast models on a quarterly basis to estimate our lifetime liability.
our aggregate representation and warranty mortgage reserve, which we report as a component of other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $731 million and $1.2 billion as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. the adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by us or one of our subsidiaries will depend on, among other things, actual future mortgage loan performance, the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests, the actual success rates of claimants, developments in litigation, actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices).
43      capital one financial corporation (cof)
as part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the potential future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards. our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of december 31, 2014 is approximately $2.1 billion, a decline from our estimate of $2.6 billion as of december 31, 2013. notwithstanding our ongoing attempts to estimate a reasonably possible amount of future losses beyond our current accrual levels based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and our current estimate of the amount of reasonably possible losses. this estimate involves considerable judgment, and reflects that there is still significant uncertainty regarding the numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels, including, but not limited to, anticipated litigation outcomes, future repurchase and indemnification claim levels, ultimate repurchase and indemnification rates, future mortgage loan performance levels, actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). in light of the significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability our subsidiaries may incur from these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. see "note 20-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others" for additional information.
customer rewards reserve we offer products, primarily credit cards, which provide reward program members with various rewards, such as cash, statement credits, gift cards, airline tickets or merchandise. the majority of our rewards do not expire and there is no limit on the number of reward points an eligible card member can earn. customer rewards costs, which we generally record as an offset to interchange income, are driven by various factors, such as card member charge volume, customer participation in the rewards program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners. we establish a customer rewards reserve that reflects management's judgment regarding rewards earned that are expected to be redeemed and the estimated redemption cost.
we use financial models to estimate ultimate redemption rates of rewards earned to date by current card members based on historical redemption trends, current enrollee redemption behavior, card product type, year of program enrollment, enrollment tenure and card spend levels. our current assumption is that the vast majority of all rewards earned will eventually be redeemed. we use a weighted-average cost per reward redeemed during the previous twelve months, adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs, including mix of rewards redeemed, to estimate future redemption costs. we continually evaluate our reserve and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, contract changes and other factors. changes in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted-average cost per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the reserve through the current period provision by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by card members as of the end of the reporting period. we recognized customer rewards expense of $2.0 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. our customer rewards liability, which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $2.7 billion and $2.3 billion as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
accounting changes and developments accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects in january 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued guidance permitting an entity to account for investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method, if certain criteria are met. the proportional method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income taxes attributable to continuing operations. historically, these investments were accounted for under the equity method and the passive losses related to the investments were recognized within non-interest expense. we adopted this guidance as of january 1, 2014 with retrospective application. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for more information.

consolidated results of operations the section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for 2014, 2013 and 2012. following this section, we provide a discussion of our business segment results. you should read this section together with our "executive summary and business outlook" where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations.
net interest income net interest income represents the difference between the interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities. interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and other borrowings. generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest bearing funding. we expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

net interest income decreased by $288 million, or 2%, to $17.8 billion in 2014, compared to $18.1 billion in 2013. these decreases were primarily driven by the portfolio sale in 2013, partially offset by growth in commercial, auto and credit card loan portfolios, lower funding costs and higher yielding investment securities in 2014.
•   average interest-earning assets: the increase in average interest-earning assets in 2014, compared to 2013, was due to continued strong growth in commercial, auto and credit card loans (excluding the impact from the portfolio sale in 2013), partially offset by the run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio within our consumer banking business. the decrease in average investment securities was due to sales and paydowns outpacing purchases.
•   net interest margin: the decrease in our net interest margin in 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily due to lower average loan yields driven by the portfolio sale in 2013 and a shift in the mix of the loan portfolio to lower yielding commercial and auto loans, partially offset by a reduction in our cost of funds and higher yielding investment securities.
net interest income increased by $1.5 billion, or 9%, to $18.1 billion in 2013, compared to $16.6 billion in 2012. the increases were primarily driven by higher average interest-earning assets, lower funding costs and higher yielding investment securities in 2013.
•   average interest-earning assets: the increase in average interest-earning assets in 2013, compared to 2012, reflects the full year impact of loans and investment securities from the ing direct acquisition and the addition of loans from the 2012 u.s. card acquisition. growth in average interest-earning assets was also driven by continued strong growth in commercial and auto loans, which was partially offset by the run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio in our consumer banking business, the expected run-off of higher-margin, higher-loss receivables acquired in the 2012 u.s. card acquisition and installment loans in our credit card business, as well as the portfolio sale in the third quarter of 2013.
•   net interest margin: the increase in our net interest margin in 2013, compared to 2012, was primarily attributable to a reduction in our cost of funds, which was due in part to the redemption of $3.65 billion of our trust preferred securities on january 2, 2013, which generally carried a higher coupon than other funding sources available to us. our lowered cost of funds also reflects the continued benefit from the shift in the mix of our funding to lower cost consumer and commercial banking deposits from higher cost wholesale sources and a decline in deposit interest rates as a result of the continued overall low interest rate environment.

(1)   we calculate the change in interest income and interest expense separately for each item. the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. when the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive.
non-interest income non-interest income primarily consists of interchange income net of rewards expense, service charges and other customer-related fees, other non-interest income and, in 2012, the bargain purchase gain attributable to the ing direct acquisition in the amount of $594 million. other non-interest income includes the pre-tax net benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations. it also includes gains and losses from the sale of investment securities, gains and losses on derivatives not accounted for in hedge accounting relationships, and hedge ineffectiveness, which we generally do not allocate to our business segments because they relate to centralized asset/liability and market risk management activities undertaken by our corporate treasury group.

(1)   represents the amount by which the fair value of the net assets acquired in the ing direct acquisition, as of the acquisition date, exceeded the consideration transferred.
(2)   represents the benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses recorded in continuing operations. for the total impact to the net benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses, including the portion recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of discontinued operations, see "md&amp;a-consolidated balance sheets analysis-table 13: changes in representation and warranty reserve."
(3)   includes mark-to-market derivative losses of $78 million in 2012 related to interest-rate swaps we entered into in 2011 to partially hedge the interest rate risk of the net assets associated with the ing direct acquisition.
(4)   includes income of $162 million in 2012 related to the sale of visa stock shares.
non-interest income increased by $194 million, or 5%, to $4.5 billion in 2014, compared to $4.3 billion in 2013. the main drivers for the increase in non-interest income were an increase in interchange fees, net, due to strong purchase volume in our credit card loan portfolio, partially offset by a decline in our service charges and other customer-related fees due to strategic choices we made related to our domestic card business.
non-interest income decreased by $529 million, or 11%, to $4.3 billion in 2013, compared to $4.8 billion in 2012. the decrease in non-interest income reflected the combined impact of the absence of the bargain purchase gain of $594 million recognized at acquisition of ing direct and income of $162 million from the sale of visa stock shares, both of which were recorded in 2012. the impact of these items was partially offset by the favorable impact of increased customer related fees and interchange fees from purchase volume growth, due in part to the acquisitions, fee based products and services revenue, a change to a benefit from a provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses and a reduction in fair value losses on free-standing derivatives.
provision for credit losses our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for loan and lease losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. we recorded a provision for credit losses of $3.5 billion in both 2014 and 2013, and a provision for credit losses of $4.4 billion in 2012. the provision for credit losses as a percentage of net interest income was 19.9%, 19.1%, and 26.6% in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
the increase in the provision for credit losses of $88 million in 2014, from 2013, was primarily driven by a small allowance build of $68 million in 2014 due to loan growth in our domestic card, auto and commercial portfolios, as compared to a release of $552 million in 2013 due to an improved credit outlook coupled with improvements in delinquency inventories in our domestic card, which were observed in 2014; partially offset by lower net charge-offs of $520 million in 2014, as compared to 2013, mainly due to continued economic improvement and portfolio seasoning in our credit card loan portfolio.
the decrease in the provision for credit losses of $962 million in 2013, from 2012, was driven by the absence of the provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2012 to establish an allowance for credit card loans acquired in the
49      capital one financial corporation (cof)
2012 u.s. card acquisition, and lower provision for credit losses in our non-acquired portfolio as underlying credit improved. this was partially offset by (i) an increase in charge-offs on the portfolio of acquired loans, as the acquired loans have run-off and have been replaced with originated loans which do not have a credit mark to absorb the charge-offs; (ii) a lower allowance release in our commercial banking business due to stabilization of the credit outlook in 2013 compared to 2012; and (iii) higher charge- offs on our auto loan portfolio in our consumer banking segment reflecting portfolio growth and increased charge off rates from historically low levels.
we provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses within "credit risk profile-summary of allowance for loan and lease losses," "note 4-loans" and "note 5-allowance for loan and lease losses." for information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies."
non-interest expense non-interest expense consists of ongoing operating costs, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services, communications and data processing expenses and other miscellaneous expenses, as well as marketing costs, acquisition-related expenses and amortization of intangibles.

__________
(1)   as of january 1, 2014, we adopted the proportional amortization method of accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for additional information. prior periods have been recast to conform to this presentation.
(2)   includes acquisition-related costs of $64 million, $193 million and $336 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. these amounts are comprised of transaction costs, legal and other professional or consulting fees, restructuring costs, and integration expense.
non-interest expense decreased by $173 million, or 1%, to $12.2 billion in 2014, compared to $12.4 billion in 2013. the decrease reflects a decline in the amortization of intangibles and a reduction in acquisition-related costs and provision for litigation matters. these were partially offset by (i) higher operating expenses attributable to growth in our commercial and auto loan portfolios; (ii) the change to include auto repossession-related expenses as a component of operating expenses (prior to january 1, 2014 these costs were reported as a component of net charge-offs); and (iii) higher marketing expenses associated with loan growth, partially offset by lower bankcard, regulatory and other fee assessments and communications and data processing expenses.
non-interest expense increased by $556 million, or 5%, to $12.4 billion in 2013, compared to $11.8 billion in 2012. the increase reflects higher operating expenses attributable to the acquired businesses and the growth in our auto loan and commercial loan portfolios. these increases were partially offset by a reduction in acquisition-related costs and other non-interest expenses.

income taxes we recorded income tax provisions of $2.1 billion (32.7% effective income tax rate), $2.2 billion (33.8% effective income tax rate) and $1.5 billion (28.5% effective income tax rate) in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to fluctuations in our pre-tax earnings, which affects the relative tax benefit of tax-exempt income, tax credits and other permanent tax items.
the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2014, from 2013, was primarily attributable to increased net tax credits and tax exempt income, and reductions in state rates, partially offset by increased discrete tax expenses.
the increase in our effective income tax rate in 2013, from 2012, was primarily attributable to increased pre-tax income, which reduced the relative benefit of tax-exempt income, tax credits and other permanent items, and the absence of discrete tax benefits of $251 million recorded in 2012 for the non-taxable bargain purchase gain of $594 million related to the acquisition of ing direct, a deferred tax benefit for changes in our state tax position resulting from the 2012 u.s. card acquisition and consolidation of ing bank, fsb with our existing banking operations, and the resolution of certain tax issues and audits. in comparison, we recorded $16 million of discrete tax expense in 2013 primarily related to adjustments to acquired tax attributes based upon the final tax returns filed, changes to enacted statutory tax rates, and resolution of certain tax issues and audits.
our effective income tax rate, excluding the impact of discrete tax items discussed above, was 32.2% in 2014 and 33.6% in both 2013 and 2012. the lower effective income tax rate before discrete items in 2014 in comparison to 2013 was primarily due to higher affordable housing and other business tax credits as a percentage of pre-tax earnings.
we provide additional information on items affecting our income taxes and effective tax rate under "note 17-income taxes."
income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax income (loss) from discontinued operations reflects ongoing costs, which primarily consist of mortgage loan repurchase representation and warranty charges, related to the mortgage origination operations of greenpoint's wholesale mortgage banking unit that we closed in 2007. income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $5 million in 2014, compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $233 million and $217 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. we recorded a total pre-tax benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses of $7 million ($4 million net of tax) in 2014, compared to a pre-tax provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses of $333 million ($210 million net of tax) in 2013 and $307 million ($194 million net of tax) in 2012.
we provide additional information on the net provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses and the related reserve for representation and warranty claims in "consolidated balance sheets analysis-mortgage representation and warranty reserve" and "note 20-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others."
business segment financial performance our principal operations are currently organized into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking. the operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized corporate treasury group, are included in the other category.
the results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. we may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. we use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results. our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. total interest income and net fees are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. the net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process, which is primarily based on a matched maturity method that takes into consideration market rates. our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources
51      capital one financial corporation (cof)
of funds, such as deposits generated by our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses, and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. the allocation process is unique to each business segment and acquired businesses. we regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods.
we refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our "managed" presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on u.s. gaap. there is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to u.s. gaap; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial service companies. in addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with u.s. gaap.
below we summarize our business segment results for 2014, 2013 and 2012 and provide a comparative discussion of these results. we also discuss changes in our financial condition and credit performance statistics as of december 31, 2014 compared to december 31, 2013. we provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in "note 19-business segments." additionally, we provide information on the outlook for each of our business segments as described above under "executive summary and business outlook."
credit card business the primary sources of revenue for our credit card business are interest income, fees collected from customers and interchange fees. expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment, professional services, communications and data processing expenses and marketing expenses. rewards costs are generally netted against interchange fees.
our credit card business generated net income from continuing operations of $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion and $1.5 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

(1)   we recognize billed finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and estimate the uncollectible amount on a quarterly basis. the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees is reflected as a reduction in revenue and is not included in our net charge-offs. total net revenue was reduced by $645 million, $796 million and $937 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees. the finance charge and fee reserve totaled $216 million and $190 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
(2)   period-end loans held for investment and average loans held for investment include accrued finance charges and fees, net of the estimated uncollectible amount.
(3)   calculated by dividing interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment. the transfer of the best buy stores, l.p. ("best buy") loan portfolio to held for sale resulted in an increase in the average yield for the total credit card business of 90 basis points in 2013.
(4)   calculated by dividing total net revenue for the period by average loans held for investment during the period for the specified loan category. interest income also includes interest income on loans held for sale. the transfer of the best buy loan portfolio from loans held for investment to loans held for sale resulted in an increase in the net revenue margin for the total credit card business of 100 basis points in 2013.
(5)   represents the net reduction in interest income attributable to the amortization of premiums on purchased loans accounted for based on contractual cash flows and the accretion of other intangibles associated with the 2012 u.s. card acquisition.
(6)   consists of credit card purchase transactions, net of returns for the period for both loans classified as held for investment and loans classified as held for sale. excludes cash advance and balance transfer transactions.
(7)   calculated by dividing the allowance for loan and lease losses as of the end of the period by period-end loans held for investment.

key factors affecting the results of our credit card business for 2014, compared to 2013, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income decreased by $657 million, or 6%, to $10.3 billion in 2014, compared to $11.0 billion in 2013. the decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by the portfolio sale in the third quarter of 2013.
•   non-interest income: non-interest income was $3.3 billion in both 2014 and 2013. during 2014 there was an increase in interchange fees, net driven by higher purchase volumes, offset by a reduction in service charges and other customer-related fees due to strategic choices we made in our domestic card business.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses decreased by $74 million, or 3%, to $2.8 billion in 2014. the decrease was due to lower net charge-offs, partially offset by an absence of a release in the allowance for loan and lease losses that was incurred in 2013 related to the domestic card loan portfolio.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense decreased by $376 million, or 5%, to $7.1 billion in 2014, compared to $7.4 billion in 2013. the decrease was largely due to (i) lower acquisition related costs; (ii) lower operating expenses driven by the portfolio sale; (iii) operating efficiencies; and (iv) lower provision for litigation matters; partially offset by higher marketing expenses. non-interest expense also included pccr intangible amortization of $369 million in 2014, compared to $434 million in 2013.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment increased by $4.6 billion, or 6%, to $85.9 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $81.3 billion as of december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily driven by growth in the domestic card loan portfolio. average loans held for investment decreased by $261 million, or less than 1%, to $78.9 billion in 2014, compared to $79.2 billion in 2013 due to the run-off of certain loans acquired in the 2012 u.s. card acquisition, as well as the portfolio sale in 2013, partially offset by growth in the second half of 2014.
•   net charge-off and delinquency statistics: our net charge-off rate decreased to 3.46% in 2014, compared to 4.15% in 2013, largely due to continued economic improvement and portfolio seasoning. the 30+ day delinquency rate decreased to 3.30% as of december 31, 2014, compared to 3.54% as of december 31, 2013, due to lower delinquency inventories.
key factors affecting the results of our credit card business for 2013, compared to 2012, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income increased by $785 million, or 8%, to $11.0 billion in 2013, compared to $10.2 billion in 2012. the increase in net interest income is primarily driven by (i) higher average yield on loans held for investment; (ii) the increase in interest and non-interest income in 2013 due to the full year impact of 2012 u.s. card acquisition; and (iii) the absence of the charge recorded in the second quarter of 2012 to establish the finance charge and fee reserve for the loans acquired in the 2012 u.s card acquisition. the higher average yield on loans held for investment was driven largely by the transfer of the best buy loan portfolio to the loans held for sale category in the first quarter of 2013. this was partially offset by a decrease in average loans held for investment due to the portfolio sale and expected continued run-off of our installment loan portfolio and other credit card loans acquired in the 2012 u.s. card acquisition.
•   non-interest income: non-interest income increased by $242 million, or 8%, to $3.3 billion in 2013, compared to $3.1 billion in 2012. the increase was primarily driven by higher net interchange fees from growth in purchase volume due in part to the 2012 u.s. card acquisition. purchase volume increased by $20.5 billion, or 11%, in 2013. other factors included increased customer-related fees from the addition of acquired credit card accounts and the absence of charges incurred in the first and second quarters of 2012 for expected refunds to customers affected by certain cross-sell sales practices in our domestic card business.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses related to our credit card business decreased by $1.3 billion, or 30%, to $2.8 billion in 2013, compared to $4.1 billion in 2012. the decrease was primarily driven by the absence of the provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2012 to establish an allowance for credit card loans acquired in the 2012 u.s. card acquisition.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $585 million, or 9%, to $7.4 billion in 2013, compared to $6.9 billion in 2012. the increase was largely due to higher operating expenses resulting from the 2012 u.s. card acquisition. this includes pccr intangible amortization expense of $434 million in 2013, compared to $350 million in 2012.
54      capital one financial corporation (cof)
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment in our credit card business decreased by $10.5 billion, or 11%, to $81.3 billion as of december 31, 2013, from $91.8 billion as of december 31, 2012, and average loans held for investment decreased by $802 million, or 1%, to $79.2 billion in 2013, compared to $80.0 billion in 2012. the decreases were due in part to the portfolio sale in 2013, as well as the expected continued run-off of our installment loan portfolio and certain other credit card loans acquired in the 2012 u.s. card acquisition, partially offset by growth in certain other credit card segments.
•   net charge-off and delinquency statistics: our net charge-off rate increased to 4.15% in 2013, compared to 3.68% in 2012. the 30+ day delinquency rate decreased to 3.54% as of december 31, 2013, compared to 3.69% as of december 31, 2012. the increase in net charge-off rates in 2013 were largely due to the impact of charge-offs from the 2012 u.s. card acquisition which was recorded at fair value.
domestic card business domestic card generated net income from continuing operations of $2.2 billion, $2.4 billion and $1.4 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. domestic card accounted for 90% of total net revenues for our credit card business in 2014, compared to 90% and 89% in 2013 and 2012, respectively, for our credit card business. income attributable to domestic card represented 90% of net income for our credit card business in 2014, compared to 91% and 92% in 2013 and 2012, respectively.

(1)   we recognize billed finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and estimate the uncollectible amount on a quarterly basis. the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees is reflected as a reduction in revenue and is not included in our net charge-offs.

(2)   period-end loans held for investment and average loans held for investment include accrued finance charges and fees, net of the estimated uncollectible amount.
(3)   calculated by dividing interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period for the specified loan category. interest income includes interest income on loans held for sale. the transfer of the best buy loan portfolio from loans held for investment to loans held for sale resulted in an increase in the average yield for the domestic card business of 99 basis points in 2013.
(4)   calculated by dividing total net revenue for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment. the transfer of the best buy loan portfolio from loans held for investment to loans held for sale resulted in an increase in the net revenue margin for the domestic card business of 111 basis points in 2013.
(5)   represents the net reduction in interest income attributable to the amortization of premiums on purchased loans accounted for based on contractual cash flows and the accretion of other intangibles associated with the 2012 u.s. card acquisition.
(6)   consists of domestic card purchase transactions, net of returns, for the period for both loans classified as held for investment and loans classified as held for sale. excludes cash advance and balance transfer transactions.
(7)   calculated by dividing the allowance for loan and lease losses as of the end of the period by period-end loans held for investment.
because our domestic card business accounts for the substantial majority of our credit card business, the key factors driving the results discussed above are similar to the key factors affecting our total credit card business. the primary driver of the decline in net income for our domestic card business in 2014, compared to 2013, was a decrease in revenue primarily driven by the portfolio sale and higher marketing expenses, partially offset by lower acquisition-related costs and provision for litigation matters, as well as lower operating expenses attributable to the portfolio sale in 2013 and operating efficiencies.
the primary drivers of the improvement in results for our domestic card business in 2013, compared to 2012, included: (i) higher interest income primarily driven by a higher average yield on loans held for investment driven largely by the transfer of the best buy loan portfolio to the held for sale category in the first quarter of 2013, as well as the absence of the charge recorded in the second quarter of 2012 to establish the finance charge and fee reserve for the acquired credit card loans; (ii) the increase in interest and non-interest income in 2013 due to the full year impact of 2012 u.s. card acquisition; and (iii) the absence of the provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2012 to establish an allowance for acquired credit card loans. these impacts were partially offset by higher operating expenses attributable to the addition of loans and increased amortization of intangibles and other assets associated with the 2012 u.s. card acquisition.
international card business international card generated net income from continuing operations of $240 million, $234 million and $126 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. international card accounted for 10% of total net revenues in 2014, compared to 10% and 11% in 2013 and 2012, respectively, for our credit card business. income attributable to international card represented 10% of net income for our credit card business in 2014, compared to 9% and 8% of net income for 2013 and 2012, respectively.

our international card business generated net income from continuing operations of $240 million in 2014, compared to net income from continuing operations of $234 million in 2013. the increase was primarily due to a lower provision for credit losses, attributable to lower net charge-offs resulting from credit improvement, partially offset by lower non-interest income due to a decrease in service charges and other customer-related fees.

key factors affecting the results of our consumer banking business for 2014, compared to 2013, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income decreased by $157 million or 3%, to $5.7 billion in 2014, compared to $5.9 billion in 2013. the decrease in net interest income was primarily attributable to compression in deposit spreads in retail banking, declining home loan portfolio balances, and margin compression in our auto loan portfolio. the decreases were partially offset by higher net interest income generated by growth in our auto loan portfolio.
consumer banking yields increased to 6.3% in 2014, as compared to 6.1% in 2013. the increase in 2014 from 2013 was driven by changes in the product mix in consumer banking as a result of growth in our auto loan portfolio and the run-off of the acquired home loan portfolio. the increase in our auto loans in relation to our total consumer banking loan portfolio drove an increase in the total consumer banking yield, even as the average yield on auto loans decreased to 8.7% in 2014 as compared to 9.8% in 2013. this decrease was primarily attributable to a shift to a higher portion of prime auto loans and increased competition in the auto business. the average yield on home loans was 3.8% and 3.4% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the higher yield in the home loan portfolio was driven by an increase in expected cash flows as a result of credit improvement on the acquired home loan portfolio.
•   non-interest income: non-interest income decreased by $65 million, or 9%, to $684 million in 2014, compared to $749 million in 2013. the decrease in non-interest income in 2014 was primarily attributable to the sale of certain msrs in 2013.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $47 million, or 7%, to $703 million in 2014, compared to $656 million in 2013. the increase in 2014, as compared to 2013, was driven by higher net charge-offs due
59      capital one financial corporation (cof)
to the growth in our auto loan portfolio and a smaller release of the allowance for loan and lease losses in the retail banking and home loan portfolios, offset by a smaller allowance build in the auto loan portfolio.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $124 million, or 3%, to $3.9 billion in 2014, compared to $3.7 billion in 2013. the increase was largely due to the growth in our auto loan portfolio and to a smaller degree, the change to include the auto repossession-related expenses as a component of operating expenses. prior to january 1, 2014, these costs were reported as a component of net charge-offs.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment increased by $677 million, or 1%, to $71.4 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $70.8 billion as of december 31, 2013, primarily due to the growth in the auto loan portfolio, mostly offset by the run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio. average loans held for investment decreased by $1.5 billion, or 2%, to $71.0 billion in 2014, compared to $72.5 billion in 2013 due to the run-off in our acquired home loan portfolio outpacing growth in our auto loan portfolio.
•   deposits: period-end deposits increased by $426 million, or less than 1%, to $168.1 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $167.7 billion as of december 31, 2013.
•   net charge-off and delinquency statistics: the net charge-off rate increased 10 basis points to 0.95% in 2014, compared to 0.85% in 2013. the increase in the net charge-off rate reflected a shift in the mix of the portfolio toward auto loans (which typically carry higher net charge-off rates than our home loan portfolio), as the home loan portfolio runs off. the 30+ day delinquency rate increased to 4.23% as of december 31, 2014, from 3.89% as of december 31, 2013.
key factors affecting the results of our consumer banking business for 2013, compared to 2012, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income increased by $117 million, or 2%, to $5.9 billion in 2013, compared to $5.8 billion in 2012. the increase in net interest income is primarily attributable to growth in our auto loans portfolio, partially offset by lower auto and deposits margins. while average loan balances grew in 2013 as compared to 2012, we saw a decline in gross interest income due to overall lower average yields on loans. the decrease in auto yields was primarily attributable to a shift in the credit quality mix of our portfolio, as well as increased competition in the marketplace. the average yield on auto loans was 9.8% in 2013, as compared to 11.0% in 2012. the decrease in home loans was largely driven by the run-off of the acquired home loans portfolio. the average yield on home loans was 3.4% in 2013 compared to 3.6% in 2012. average deposit balances increased to $169.7 billion in 2013, from $162.6 billion in 2012, while the average deposit interest rate declined to 0.63% in 2013, from 0.70% in 2012.
•   non-interest income: non-interest income decreased by $33 million, or 4%, to $749 million in 2013, compared to $782 million in 2012, related to the mark-to-market gains on retained interests in interest-only strips and negative amortization mortgage securities recognized in the third quarter of 2012.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $67 million, or 11%, to $656 million in 2013, reflecting higher auto loan charge-offs attributable to auto portfolio growth and an increase in the auto charge-off rate from historically low levels.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense decreased by $126 million, or 3%, to $3.7 billion in 2013. the decrease was largely due to the absence of ing direct acquisition-related costs and other one-time items incurred in 2012, which were partially offset by increased expenses related to the growth in our auto loan portfolio.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment in our consumer banking business declined by $4.4 billion, or 6%, to $70.8 billion as of december 31, 2013, due to the run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio, partially offset by higher period-end auto loan balances due to the continued high volume of auto loan originations. average loans held for investment increased by $631 million, or 1%, to $72.5 billion in 2013, compared to $71.8 billion in 2012 due to growth in our auto loan portfolio outpacing the run-off in our acquired home loan portfolio.
•   deposits: period-end deposits in our consumer banking business declined by $4.7 billion, or 3%, to $167.7 billion as of december 31, 2013, primarily due to the expected run-off of our legacy national direct bank deposits.
60      capital one financial corporation (cof)
•   net charge-off and delinquency statistics: the net charge-off rate increased to 0.85% in 2013, compared to 0.74% in 2012. the 30+ day delinquency rate increased to 3.89% as of december 31, 2013, from 3.34% as of december 31, 2012. the increase in the net charge-off rates reflect moderately higher auto loan charge-offs, partially offset by improved home loan performance. the overall delinquency rates increased moderately largely due to the run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio, which were included in the denominator in calculating the delinquency rates.
commercial banking business the primary sources of revenue for our commercial banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from customer fees and related transactions. because we have some investments that generate tax-exempt income or tax credits, we make certain reclassifications to our commercial banking business results to present revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis. expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, ongoing operating costs, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy, equipment, professional services, communications and data processing expenses, as well as marketing expenses.
as of january 1, 2014, we adopted the proportional amortization method of accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects. the proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which we will receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income taxes attributable to continuing operations. historically, these investments were accounted for under the equity method of accounting and the passive losses related to the investments were recognized within non-interest expense. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for more information.
our commercial banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $659 million, $731 million and $810 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

key factors affecting the results of our commercial banking business for 2014, compared to 2013, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income increased by $77 million, or 5%, to $1.8 billion in 2014, compared to $1.7 billion in 2013. the increase was driven by growth in commercial and multifamily real estate and commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by lower loan yields driven by market and competitive pressures.
•   non-interest income: non-interest income increased by $55 million, or 14%, to $450 million in 2014, compared to $395 million in 2013, primarily driven by increased revenue related to fee-based services and products attributable to the beech street business.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $117 million, to $93 million in 2014, compared to a benefit of $24 million in 2013, primarily due to the change from an allowance release in 2013 driven by credit improvements, to an allowance build in 2014 attributable to loan growth and portfolio specific risks. the above impact was partially offset by a smaller reserve build due to lower growth in unfunded lending commitments.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $125 million, or 13%, to $1.1 billion in 2014, compared to $958 million in 2013, driven by operating expenses associated with continued investments in business growth.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment increased by $5.9 billion, or 13%, to $50.9 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $45.0 billion as of december 31, 2013, and average loans held for investment increased by $7.1 billion, or 17%, to $47.9 billion in 2014, compared to $40.8 billion in 2013. the increases were driven by loan growth in the commercial and industrial and commercial and multifamily real estate businesses.
•   deposits: period-end deposits increased by $1.4 billion, or 5%, to $32.0 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $30.6 billion as of december 31, 2013, driven by our strategy to deepen and expand relationships with commercial customers.
•   net charge-off statistics: the net charge-off rate decreased to 0.02% in 2014, from 0.03% in 2013. the nonperforming loans rate increased to 0.34% as of december 31, 2014, from 0.33% as of december 31, 2013. the continued strength in the credit metrics in our commercial banking business reflects stable credit trends.
key factors affecting the results of our commercial banking business for 2013, compared to 2012, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income increased by $123 million, or 8%, to $1.7 billion in 2013. the increase was primarily driven by growth in our commercial lending business and higher deposit balances.
•   non-interest income: non-interest income increased by $55 million, or 16%, to $395 million in 2013, driven by increased revenue related to fee-based products and services from the beech street capital acquisition.
•   provision for credit losses: the benefit for credit losses decreased by $246 million, or 91%, to $24 million in 2013, compared to $270 million in 2012 due to the stabilization of the credit outlook which resulted in a lower release of the allowance for loan and lease losses in 2013.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $48 million, or 5%, to $958 million in 2013, driven by investments in business growth and infrastructure enhancements and the costs associated with beech street capital.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment in our commercial banking business increased by $6.2 billion, or 16%, in 2013, to $45.0 billion as of december 31, 2013, and average loans held for investment increased by $4.9

billion, or 14%, to $40.8 billion in 2013, compared to $35.9 billion in 2012. the increases were driven by strong loan originations in the commercial lending business, which was partially offset by the continued run-off of the small-ticket commercial real estate loan portfolio.
•   deposits: period-end deposits in the commercial banking business increased by $701 million, or 2%, to $30.6 billion as of december 31, 2013, from $29.9 billion as of december 31, 2012, driven by our strategy to strengthen existing relationships and increase liquidity from commercial customers.
•   net charge-off statistics: the net charge-off rate decreased to 0.03% in 2013, from 0.12% in 2012. the nonperforming loan rate decreased to 0.33% as of december 31, 2013, from 0.73% as of december 31, 2012. the continued strength in the credit metrics in our commercial banking business reflected stable credit trends and underlying collateral values.
other category other includes unallocated amounts related to our centralized corporate treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management, gains and losses on our investment securities portfolio and certain trading activities. other also includes foreign exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign currency-denominated transactions; certain gains and losses on the sale and securitization of loans; unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain acquisition and restructuring charges; a portion of the net provision for representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations; certain material items that are non-recurring in nature; and offsets related to certain line-item reclassifications.

(2)   some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits, accordingly we make certain reclassifications within our commercial banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, with offsetting reclassifications within other, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35%.
net income from continuing operations recorded in other was $90 million in 2014, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $443 million in 2013. the shift to a net profit from a net loss was primarily due to lower funding costs, as well as the absence of the one-time charge associated with our redemption of trust preferred securities in january 2013.
the shift in the other category to a net loss from continuing operations of $443 million in 2013, from net income from continuing operations of $6 million in 2012, was primarily due to three non-recurring items recognized in 2012 related to the ing direct acquisition. we recognized a bargain purchase gain of $594 million related to the ing direct acquisition and a gain of $162 million from the sale of visa stock shares during the first quarter of 2012, which was partially offset by a derivative loss of $78 million recognized in the first quarter of 2012 related to the interest rate swaps we entered into in 2011 to partially hedge the interest rate risk of the net assets associated with the ing direct acquisition.

consolidated balance sheets analysis total assets increased by $12.0 billion to $308.9 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $296.9 billion, as of december 31, 2013. the predominant area of asset growth was in loans held for investment, which increased $11.1 billion. total liabilities increased by $8.5 billion to $263.8 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $255.3 billion as of december 31, 2013, primarily driven by issuances of long-term debt. stockholders' equity increased by $3.5 billion to $45.1 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $41.6 billion as of december 31, 2013. the increase in stockholders' equity was primarily attributable to our net income of $4.4 billion in 2014 and $969 million in preferred stock issuances during 2014, partially offset by $2.0 billion of share repurchases under the 2014 stock repurchase program and dividend payments of $747 million.
the following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during 2014. period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to ensure the adequacy of capital while managing our liquidity requirements for the company and our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite.
investment securities our investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: u.s. treasury and agency debt; corporate debt securities guaranteed by u.s. government agencies; u.s. government-sponsored enterprise or agency ("agency") and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ("rmbs") and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("cmbs"); other asset-backed securities ("abs"); and other investments. the carrying value of our investments in u.s. treasury, agency securities and other securities guaranteed by the u.s. government or agencies of the u.s. government represented 86% and 77% of our total investment securities portfolio as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in our investment in u.s. treasury and agency securities is primarily due to our preparation for the final rules implementing the basel iii liquidity coverage ratio, for which we provide additional information in "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation."
during 2014, the fair value of our investment portfolio increased by $2.1 billion, or 4%, to $63.1 billion as of december 31, 2014 from $61.0 billion as of december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily driven by lower market interest rates.
during 2013, the fair value of our investment portfolio decreased by $3.0 billion, or 5%, to $61.0 billion as of december 31, 2013 from $64.0 billion as of december 31, 2012. the fair value of our securities available for sale portfolio was $41.8 billion as of december 31, 2013, a $22.2 billion decrease from $64.0 billion as of december 31, 2012. this decrease was primarily driven by the transfer of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity with a fair value of $18.3 billion as of the date of the transfer. we transferred these securities to held to maturity in consideration of changes to regulatory capital requirements under the final basel iii capital standards, and to reduce the impact of price volatility on aoci. the transferred securities included net pre-tax unrealized losses of $1.5 billion at the date of transfer. excluding the change on the held to maturity securities subsequent to the transfer, the fair value of our securities decreased $4 billion in 2013 driven by the rise in interest rates and normal portfolio activity.
we had gross unrealized gains of $886 million and gross unrealized losses of $237 million on available-for sale investment securities as of december 31, 2014, compared to gross unrealized gains of $799 million and gross unrealized losses of $631 million as of december 31, 2013. the decrease in gross unrealized losses in 2014 was primarily driven by lower interest rates. of the $237 million in gross unrealized losses as of december 31, 2014, $206 million was related to securities that had been in a loss position for more than 12 months. we provide information on otti recognized in earnings on our investment securities above in "consolidated results of operations-non-interest income."

period-end loans held for investment increased by $11.1 billion, or 5.6%, in 2014, to $208.3 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $197.2 billion as of december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily due to commercial and industrial, and commercial and multifamily real estate loan growth in our commercial banking business, strong growth in our domestic card loan portfolio in our credit card business, and strong auto loan originations outpacing the run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio in our consumer banking business.
we provide additional information on the composition of our loan portfolio and credit quality below in "credit risk profile," "md&a-consolidated results of operations" and "note 4-loans."
loans held for sale loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value, increased to $626 million as of december 31, 2014, from $218 million as of december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily driven by higher originations in the commercial banking business and timing of sales of loans.
deposits our deposits represent our largest source of funding for our operations, providing a consistent source of low-cost funds. total deposits increased by $1.0 billion to $205.5 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $204.5 billion as of december 31, 2013. the increase in deposits was primarily driven by the growth in our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses as a result of our continued focus on deepening deposit relationships with existing customers and our continued marketing strategy to attract new business. we provide information on the composition of our deposits, average outstanding balances, interest expense and yield below in "liquidity risk profile."

securitized debt obligations securitized debt obligations increased by $1.3 billion during 2014, to $11.6 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $10.3 billion as of december 31, 2013. the increase was driven by issuances of $4.3 billion of securitized debt obligations during 2014, partially offset by maturities of $3.0 billion. we provide additional information on our borrowings below in "liquidity risk profile."
other debt other debt, which consists primarily of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes and fhlb advances, totaled $36.8 billion as of december 31, 2014, of which $17.1 billion represented short-term borrowings and $19.7 billion represented long-term debt. other debt totaled $30.4 billion as of december 31, 2013, of which $16.2 billion represented short-term borrowings and $14.2 billion represented long-term debt.
the increase in other debt of $6.4 billion in 2014 was primarily attributable to the issuance of $7.8 billion of unsecured senior notes, as well as net increases of $1.0 billion in fhlb advances, partially offset by maturities of $2.4 billion in unsecured senior notes. we provide additional information on our borrowings below in "liquidity risk profile" and in "note 9-deposits and borrowings."
mortgage representation and warranty reserve we acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. these subsidiaries are capital one home loans, llc, which was acquired in february 2005; greenpoint, which was acquired in december 2006 as part of the north fork bancorporation, inc. ("north fork") acquisition; and ccb, which was acquired in february 2009 and subsequently merged into cona.
we have established representation and warranty reserves for losses associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities. these reserves are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. the reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires the application of judgment. we evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis. we build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses, which we report in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non-interest income for loans originated and sold by ccb and capital one home loans, llc and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by greenpoint. the aggregate reserve for all three entities totaled $731 million as of december 31, 2014, compared to $1.2 billion as of december 31, 2013.

as part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards. our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of december 31, 2014, is approximately $2.1 billion, a decline from our estimate of $2.6 billion as of december 31, 2013. the decrease in the reasonably possible estimate of the representation and warranty reserve was primarily driven by claims paid and legal developments including settlements.

we provide additional information related to the representation and warranty reserve, including factors that may impact the adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by our subsidiaries, in "note 20-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others."
deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management's judgment that realization is "more likely than not." we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. these sources of income rely heavily on estimates. we use our historical experience and our short and long-range business forecasts to provide insight.
as of december 31, 2014, we have recorded deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances, of approximately $3.3 billion, which is a decrease of $400 million from $3.7 billion at december 31, 2013. we have recorded a valuation allowance of $148 million and $139 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we expect to fully realize the 2014 net deferred tax asset amounts in future periods. if changes in circumstances lead us to change our judgment about our ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years, we will adjust our valuation allowances in the period that our change in judgment occurs and record a corresponding increase or charge to income.
we provide additional information on income taxes in "consolidated results of operations" and in "note 17-income taxes."
off-balance sheet arrangements and variable interest entities in the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various types of arrangements with limited liability companies, partnerships or trusts that often involve special purpose entities and variable interest entities ("vie"). some of these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or may be recorded in amounts different from the full contract or notional amount of the arrangements, depending on the nature or structure of, and accounting required to be applied to, the arrangement. these arrangements may expose us to potential losses in excess of the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. our involvement in these arrangements can take many forms, including securitization and servicing activities, the purchase or sale of mortgage-backed or other asset-backed securities in connection with our home loan portfolio and loans to vies that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.
our continuing involvement in unconsolidated vies primarily consists of certain mortgage loan trusts and community reinvestment and development entities. we provide a discussion of our activities related to these vies in "note 6-variable interest entities and securitizations."
capital management the level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing and economic capital. the level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments.
capital standards and prompt corrective action bank holding companies and national banks are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the federal reserve and the occ, respectively. the capital adequacy standards set forth minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements that are based on quantitative and qualitative measures of assets and off-balance sheet items. national banks, as insured depository institutions, are also subject to prompt corrective action ("pca") capital regulations, which require the u.s. federal banking agencies to take "prompt corrective action" for banks that do not meet established minimum capital requirements.
69      capital one financial corporation (cof)
in july 2013, the federal banking agencies finalized a new capital rule that implements the basel iii capital accord (the "final basel iii capital rules") developed by the basel committee on banking supervision ("basel committee") and certain dodd-frank act capital provisions and updates the pca capital requirements. prior to being revised in the final basel iii capital rules, the minimum risk-based capital requirements adopted by the u.s. federal banking agencies followed the basel i framework, originally promulgated pursuant to the basel committee's basel i accord, and the advanced approaches capital rules ("advanced approaches"), based upon the framework originally promulgated as a result of the basel ii accord. the final basel iii capital rules amended both the basel i and advanced approaches frameworks, establishing a new common equity tier 1 capital requirement and setting higher minimum capital ratio requirements. the company refers to the amended basel i framework as the "basel iii standardized approach," and the amended advanced approaches framework as the "basel iii advanced approaches."
at the end of 2012, the company met one of the two independent eligibility criteria set by banking regulators for becoming subject to the advanced approaches capital rules. as a result, the company has undertaken a multi-year process of implementing the advanced approaches regime for calculating risk-weighted assets and regulatory capital levels. certain provisions of the final basel iii capital rules began to take effect on january 1, 2014 for advanced approaches banking organizations, including the company. the company entered parallel run under advanced approaches on january 1, 2015, during which it will calculate capital ratios under both the basel iii standardized approach and the basel iii advanced approaches, though it will continue to use the basel iii standardized approach for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements. by rule, the parallel run must last at least four consecutive quarters. therefore, the first quarter of 2016 is the earliest possible date on which the company would use the basel iii advanced approaches framework in calculating its regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets for purposes of risk-based capital requirements. consistent with the experience of other u.s. banks, it is possible that our parallel run will last longer than the four quarter minimum. under the dodd-frank act and the final basel iii capital rules, organizations subject to basel iii advanced approaches may not hold less capital than would be required under the basel iii standardized approach. therefore, even after we exit parallel run, we will continue to calculate regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets under the basel iii standardized approach.
as of january 1, 2014, the new minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements for advanced approaches banking organizations include a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.0%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 5.5%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4.0%. on january 1, 2015, the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements increased to 4.5% for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio and to 6.0% for the tier 1 risk-based capital ratio. the minimum requirements for the total risk-based capital ratio and the tier 1 leverage capital ratio did not change from 2014 to 2015.
the final basel iii capital rules also introduced a new supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0% for all advanced approaches banking organizations. on september 3, 2014 the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that revised the calculation of total leverage exposures and implemented the supplementary leverage ratio. the supplementary leverage ratio compares tier 1 capital to total leverage exposures, and includes all on-balance sheet assets and many off-balance sheet assets, including derivatives and unused commitments. the new supplementary leverage ratio becomes effective on january 1, 2018, however as an advanced approaches banking organization, we are required to calculate and publicly disclose our supplementary leverage ratio beginning in the first quarter of 2015.
insured depository institutions are also subject to pca capital regulations. under current pca regulations, an insured depository institution is considered to be well-capitalized if it maintains a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5.0%, and is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or pca directive issued by its regulator. while the final basel iii capital rules increased some of the thresholds for the pca capital categories and add the new common equity tier 1 capital ratio to the pca regulations, those changes are not effective until january 1, 2015. beginning on january 1, 2015, the well-capitalized level for the tier 1 risk-based capital ratio will increase to 8.0%, and the well-capitalized level for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio will be established at 6.5%. the well-capitalized levels for the total risk-based capital ratio and the tier 1 leverage capital ratio will not change.
prior to 2014, we also disclosed a tier 1 common capital ratio for our bank holding company, which is a regulatory capital measure widely used by investors, analysts, rating agencies and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies. there was no mandated minimum or well-capitalized standard for the tier 1 common capital ratio.
we disclose a non-gaap tce ratio in "part ii-item 6. summary of selected financial data." while the tce ratio is a capital measure widely used by investors, analysts, rating agencies, and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. we provide information
70      capital one financial corporation (cof)
on the calculation of this ratio in "md&a-table f-reconciliation of non-gaap measures and calculation of regulatory capital measures."
table 14 provides a comparison of our regulatory capital ratios under the federal banking agencies' capital adequacy standards as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. under the final basel iii capital rules, beginning on january 1, 2014, as an advanced approaches banking organization that had yet to enter or exit parallel run, we began using the basel iii standardized approach for calculating our regulatory capital, subject to applicable transition provisions. throughout 2014, we continued to use basel i for calculating our risk-weighted assets in our regulatory capital ratios, as required under the final basel iii capital rules. on january 1, 2015, we began using the basel iii standardized approach for calculating our risk-weighted assets in our regulatory capital ratios.

capital one financial corporation exceeded federal banking agencies' minimum capital requirements and the banks exceeded minimum regulatory requirements and were "well-capitalized" under pca requirements as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. our common equity tier 1 capital ratio, as calculated under the basel iii standardized approach, subject to transition provisions, was 12.46% as of december 31, 2014. our tier 1 common capital ratio, as calculated under basel i, was 12.19% as of december 31, 2013. these numbers are not directly comparable due to methodological differences in the calculation of the ratios and the transition requirements under the final basel iii capital rules. for purposes of our capital plan that was submitted to the board of governors of the federal reserve on january 5, 2015, we will be assessed on our ability to maintain specified minimum levels of capital under our currently effective basel iii standardized approach regime, along with a tier 1 common ratio of 5.0% on a pro forma

basis as calculated under basel i, under baseline and stressful conditions. we estimate that our tier 1 common ratio, as calculated under basel i, was approximately 12.46% as of december 31, 2014. see "md&a-table f-reconciliation of non-gaap measures and calculation of regulatory capital measures" for additional information about our tier 1 common ratio as calculated under basel i.
as described above, we currently are using the basel iii standardized approach for calculating our regulatory capital, subject to transition provisions. the calculation of our basel iii standardized approach common equity tier 1 capital under the final basel iii capital rules includes additional adjustments and deductions not included in the tier 1 common capital calculation under basel i, such as the inclusion of the unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investment securities included in aoci and adjustments related to intangibles. the inclusion of aoci and the adjustments related to intangibles are phased-in at 20% for 2014, 40% for 2015, 60% for 2016, 80% for 2017 and 100% for 2018.
the following table compares our common equity tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as of december 31, 2014, calculated based on the final basel iii capital rules, subject to applicable transition provisions, to our estimated common equity tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as of december 31, 2014, calculated under the basel iii standardized approach, as it applies when fully phased-in. our estimated common equity tier 1 capital ratio under fully phased-in basel iii standardized approach is based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, interpretations provided by our regulators, and is subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations.
in november 2014, our regulators informed us that they had updated their interpretation guidance regarding the prospective capital treatment for certain securitization exposures. this guidance resulted in a reduction of approximately 20 basis points to our estimated fully phased-in basel iii standardized approach common equity tier 1 capital ratio. as we continue to engage with our regulators during our parallel run, we anticipate that there could be further changes to the calculation.
see the table and notes below for further discussion on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions used in calculating this ratio.

__________
(1)   estimated common equity tier 1 capital ratio under fully phased-in basel iii standardized approach is a non-gaap financial measure.
(2)   assumes adjustments are fully phased-in.
(3)   adjustments to the basel i approach to calculating risk-weighted assets include higher risk weights for exposures 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual, high volatility commercial real estate, securitization exposures and corresponding adjustments to pccr intangibles, deferred tax assets and certain other assets in the calculation of common equity tier 1 capital under the basel iii standardized approach.
(4)   calculated by dividing estimated common equity tier 1 capital under the fully phased-in basel iii standardized approach by estimated risk-weighted assets under the basel iii standardized approach.
under the final basel iii capital rules, when we complete our parallel run for the advanced approaches, our minimum risk-based capital requirement will be the greater requirement of the basel iii standardized approach and the basel iii advanced approaches. see "part 1-item 1-supervision and regulation-basel iii and u.s. capital rules" for additional information. based on our business mix, we anticipate that we will need to hold more regulatory capital under the basel iii advanced approaches than under the basel iii standardized approach to meet our minimum required regulatory capital ratios.

capital planning and regulatory stress testing in november 2011, the federal reserve finalized capital planning rules applicable to large bank holding companies like us. under these rules, bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must submit a capital plan to the federal reserve on an annual basis that contains a description of all planned capital actions, including dividends or stock repurchases, over a nine-quarter planning horizon beginning with the fourth quarter of the calendar year prior to the submission of the capital plan ("ccar cycle"). the bank holding company may take the capital actions in its capital plan if the federal reserve provides a non-objection to the plan. for the 2014 ccar cycle, the federal reserve's objection or non-objection applies specifically to capital actions during the four quarters beginning with the second quarter of 2014 in the planning horizon ("approval window"). on october 17, 2014, the federal reserve issued a final rule to modify the regulations for capital planning and stress testing. the final rule changes the annual capital plan and stress test cycle start date from october 1 to january 1, effective for the cycle beginning january 1, 2016. to allow for a transition to the change in timing, the federal reserve's objection or non-objection applies to the capital actions spanning the five quarters starting with the second quarter of 2015 for the 2015 ccar cycle. subsequent submissions each would cover a four-quarter period. for additional information on the final rule, see "part 1-item 1. business-supervision and regulation."
after the federal reserve's non-objection to our 2014 capital plan, we maintained our quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share for all four quarters in 2014. in addition, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of common stock through the end of the first quarter of 2015. during 2014, we repurchased approximately $2.0 billion of common stock and expect to complete the 2014 stock repurchase program by the end of the first quarter of 2015. we expect to complete this repurchase program by the end of the first quarter of 2015. on january 5, 2015 we submitted our capital plan to the board of directors of the federal reserve as part of the 2015 ccar cycle.
equity offerings and transactions on june 12, 2014, the company issued and sold 20 million depositary shares ("depositary shares"), each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of 6.25% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series c, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $25 per depositary share (equivalent to $1,000 per share of series c preferred stock) (the "series c preferred stock"). the net proceeds of the offering of series c preferred stock were approximately $484 million, after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses.
on october 31, 2014, the company issued and sold 20 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of 6.70% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series d, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $25 per depositary share (equivalent to $1,000 per share of series d preferred stock) (the "series d preferred stock"). the net proceeds of the offering of series d preferred stock were approximately $485 million, after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses.
under the terms of the series c preferred stock and series d preferred stock, the ability of the company to pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or to repurchase, redeem or acquire its common stock or any preferred stock ranking on parity with or junior to the preferred stock, is subject to restrictions in the event that the company does not declare and either pay or set aside a sum sufficient for payment of dividends on the related series of preferred stock for the immediately preceding dividend period.
dividend policy and stock purchases we paid common stock dividends of $0.30 per share in each quarter of 2014. we paid preferred stock dividends of $15.00 per share on the outstanding shares of our 6.00% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series b (the "series b preferred stock") in each quarter of 2014. we also paid preferred stock dividends of $13.7153 per share and $15.625 per share in the third and fourth quarters of 2014, respectively, on the outstanding shares of series c preferred stock.
on january 29, 2015, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, payable on february 20, 2015 and quarterly dividends on our series b preferred stock, series c preferred stock, and series d preferred stock payable on march 2, 2015. based on these declarations, the company will pay approximately $166 million in common equity dividends and approximately $32 million in total preferred dividends in the first quarter of 2015.
the declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors. as a bank holding company, our ability to pay dividends is largely
73      capital one financial corporation (cof)
dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the banks to transfer funds to our bank holding company. funds available for dividend payments from cobna and cona were $1.6 billion and $281 million, respectively, as of december 31, 2014. there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders.
the timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, our capital position and amount of retained earnings. our stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time.

risk management risk framework we use a risk framework to provide an overall enterprise-wide approach for effectively managing risk. we execute against our risk framework with the "three lines of defense" risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk.
the "first line of defense" is comprised of the business areas that through their day-to-day business activities take risk on our behalf. as the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk, and for mitigating our overall risk exposure. the first line formulates strategy and operates within the risk appetite and framework. the "second line of defense" provides oversight of first line risk taking and management, and is comprised primarily of our risk management organization. the second line assists in determining risk capacity, risk appetite, and the strategies, policies and structure for managing risks. the second line owns the risk framework. the second line is both an 'expert advisor' to the first line and an 'effective challenger' of first line risk activities. the "third line of defense" is comprised of our internal audit and credit review functions. the third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the board of directors that first and second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well-designed and working as intended.
our risk framework, which is built around governance, processes and people, consists of the following eight key elements:
establish governance processes, accountabilities and risk appetites the "starting point" of our risk framework is the establishment of governance processes, accountabilities and risk appetites. our board of directors and senior management establish the tone at the top regarding the importance of internal control, including standards of conduct and the integrity and ethical values of the company. management reinforces the expectations at the various levels of the organization. this portion of the framework sets the foundation for the methods that govern risk taking, the interactions within and among the lines of defense and the risk appetites and tolerances.
identify and assess risks and ownership identifying and assessing risks and ownership is the beginning of the more detailed day-to-day process of managing risk. this portion of the framework clarifies the importance of strong first-line management and accountability for identifying and assessing risk while specifying the roles of the second line to identify and assess risk, particularly when taking on new initiatives.
develop and operate controls, monitoring and mitigation plans we develop, operate and monitor controls to manage risk within tolerance levels. the first line develops controls to oversee and manage identified risks. controls may prevent risks from occurring (e.g., ensuring compliance with a law or regulation), discover when a risk has been realized, or measure the amount of risk being taken so that the amount may be proactively managed. whenever possible, plans are implemented to mitigate risks or reduce them to lower levels to reduce exposure. the first line leads mitigation, control and monitoring actions. the second line is a consultant on control design when needed.
74      capital one financial corporation (cof)
test and detect control gaps and perform corrective action while the first line is principally accountable for taking, controlling and monitoring risk, the second line oversees and monitors first line risk taking, including the effectiveness of first line controls, and the third line independently tests first and second line controls. these activities provide the second and third lines of defense with the ability to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized or unplanned risk taking within the organization. identified control gaps are closed by first line corrective action.
escalate key risks and gaps to executive management and, when appropriate, the board of directors escalation is an important component of our overall risk framework. use of escalation is encouraged and doesn't necessarily indicate a failure on the part of first, second or third line risk management. through escalation in the first line, decisions requiring judgment can be raised to executives who have the broadest possible context and experience to make challenging choices. escalation in the second and third lines of defense can also demonstrate part of their core responsibilities of effective challenge. risks are escalated to the board of directors to ensure their alignment with material risk decisions and/or transparency to the largest risks facing the organization and to enable board of directors engagement when needed.
calculate and allocate capital in alignment with risk management and measurement processes (including stress testing)
capital is held to protect the company from unforeseen risks or unexpected risk severity. as such, it is important that capital planning processes be well linked with risk management practices to ensure the appropriate capital protections are in place for the safety and soundness of the company. stress testing and economic capital measurement, both of which incorporate inputs from across the risk spectrum, are key tools for evaluating our capital position and risk adjusted returns.
support with the right culture, talent and skills the right culture, talent and skills are critical to effective risk management. the activities and actions specified in our risk framework are supported with the right culture to ensure that both the spirit and the letter of the risk management action are pursued. skills necessary to effectively manage risk are reinforced through performance management systems. when needed, risk talent is augmented through recruitment of industry experts as well as training and development of internal associates.
enable with the right data, infrastructure and programs data, infrastructure and programs are key enablers of our overall risk management processes and practices. these core requirements enable effective risk modeling, efficient first, second and third line risk activity performance and cross-line interaction. in addition, effective program design of each risk category is regularly assessed to ensure risk practices continue to evolve with leading industry practice and continue to interact across categories as desired for a strong overall risk management program.
risk appetite risk appetite refers to the level of risk our business is willing to take in pursuit of our corporate business objectives. the board of directors approves our risk appetite including specific risk limits where applicable. while first line executives manage risk on a day-to-day basis, the chief risk officer provides effective challenge and independent oversight to ensure that risks are within the appetite and specific limits established by the board of directors. the chief risk officer reports to the board of directors regularly on the nature and level of risk across all eight risk categories. in addition to his broader management responsibilities, our chief executive officer is responsible for developing the strategy and mission of our organization, determining and leading our culture, and reviewing and providing input into our risk appetite.
we have a defined risk appetite for each of our eight risk categories that is approved by our board of directors. stated risk appetites define the parameters for taking and accepting risks and are used by management and our board of directors to make business decisions. we communicate risk appetite statements, limits and thresholds to the appropriate levels in the organization and monitor adherence.
risk categories we apply our risk framework to protect our company from the eight major categories of risk that we are exposed to through our business activities. our eight major categories of risk are:
75      capital one financial corporation (cof)
•   compliance risk: compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations. compliance risk can also arise from nonconformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, contractual obligations, or ethical standards that reinforce those laws, rules, or regulations;
•   credit risk: credit risk is the risk of loss from an obligor's failure to meet the terms of any contract or otherwise fail to perform as agreed;
•   legal risk: legal risk represents the risk of material adverse impact due to: new and changed laws and regulations; interpretations of law; drafting, interpretation and enforceability of contracts; adverse decisions or consequences arising from litigation or regulatory scrutiny; the establishment, management and governance of our legal entity structure; and the failure to seek or follow appropriate legal counsel when needed;
•   liquidity risk: liquidity risk is the risk that the company will not be able to meet its future financial obligations as they come due, or invest in future asset growth because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time period;
•   market risk: market risk is the risk that an institution's earnings or the economic value of equity could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or other market factors;
•   operational risk: operational risk is the risk of loss, capital impairment, adverse customer experience, or reputational impact resulting from failure to comply with policies and procedures, inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, or from external events;
•   reputation risk: reputation risk is the risk to market value, recruitment and retention of talented associates and maintenance of a loyal customer base due to the negative perceptions of capital one's internal and external constituents regarding capital one's business strategies and activities; and
•   strategic risk: strategic risk is the risk of material impact on current or anticipated earnings, capital, franchise or enterprise value arising from: the company's competitive and market position and evolving forces in the industry that can affect that position; lack of responsiveness to these conditions; strategic decisions to change the company's scale, market position or operating model; or failure to appropriately consider implementation risks inherent in the company's strategy.
below we provide an overview of how we manage our eight primary risk categories.
compliance risk management we recognize that compliance requirements for financial institutions are increasingly complex and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. in response, we continuously evaluate the regulatory environment and pro-actively adjust our compliance risk program to fully address these expectations.
our compliance management program establishes expectations for determining compliance requirements, assessing the risk of new product offerings, creating appropriate controls and training to address requirements, monitoring for control performance, and independently testing for adherence to compliance requirements. the program also establishes regular compliance reporting to senior business leaders, the executive committee and the board of directors.
the chief compliance officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our compliance risk management program. business areas incorporate compliance requirements and controls into their business policies, standards, processes and procedures. they regularly monitor and report on the efficacy of their compliance controls and corporate compliance periodically independently tests to validate the effectiveness of business controls.
credit risk management we recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality. consequently, we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns. our most important tool in this endeavor is sound underwriting. in unsecured consumer loan underwriting, we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting. in commercial underwriting, we generally require strong cash flow, collateral and covenants and guarantees. in addition to sound underwriting, we continually monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans.
76      capital one financial corporation (cof)
the chief risk officer, in conjunction with the consumer and commercial chief credit officers, is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures, including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority, and monitoring credit exposure and performance of our lending-related transactions. these responsibilities are fulfilled by the chief consumer credit officer and the chief commercial credit officer who are responsible for evaluating the risk implications of credit strategy and for oversight of credit for both the existing portfolio and any new credit investments. the chief consumer credit officer and the chief commercial credit officer have formal approval authority for various types and levels of credit decisions, including individual commercial loan transactions. division presidents within each segment are responsible for managing the credit risk within their divisions and maintaining processes to control credit risk and comply with credit policies and guidelines. in addition, the chief risk officer establishes policies, delegates approval authority and monitors performance for non-loan credit exposure entered into with financial counterparties or through the purchase of credit sensitive securities in our investment portfolio.
our credit policies establish standards in five areas: customer selection, underwriting, monitoring, remediation, and portfolio management. the standards in each area provide a framework comprising specific objectives and control processes. these standards are supported by detailed policies and procedures for each component of the credit process. starting with customer selection, our goal is to generally provide credit on terms that generate above hurdle returns. we use a number of quantitative and qualitative factors to manage credit risk, including setting credit risk limits and guidelines for each of our lines of business. we monitor performance relative to these guidelines and report results and any required mitigating actions to appropriate senior management committees and our board of directors.
legal risk management the general counsel provides legal evaluation and guidance to the enterprise and business areas and partners with other risk management functions such as compliance and internal audit. this evaluation and guidance is based on an assessment of the type and degree of legal risk associated with the internal business area practices and activities and of the controls the business has in place to mitigate legal risks.
liquidity risk management we seek to mitigate liquidity risk strategically and tactically. from a strategic perspective, we have acquired and built deposit gathering businesses and significantly reduced our loan to deposit ratio. from a tactical perspective, we have accumulated a sizable liquidity reserve comprised of cash, high-quality, unencumbered securities, and committed collateralized credit lines. we also continue to maintain access to the secured and unsecured markets through ongoing issuance. this combination of stable and diversified funding sources and our stockpile of liquidity reserves enables us to maintain confidence in our liquidity position.
the chief risk officer, in conjunction with the chief market and liquidity risk officer, is responsible for the establishment of liquidity risk management policies and standards for governance and monitoring of liquidity risk at a corporate level. the chief financial officer is accountable for the management of liquidity risk. we assess liquidity strength by evaluating several different balance sheet metrics under severe stress scenarios to ensure we can withstand significant funding degradation in both idiosyncratic, and market wide and combined liquidity stress scenarios. management reports liquidity metrics to appropriate senior management committees and our board of directors no less than quarterly. we continuously monitor market and economic conditions to evaluate emerging stress conditions with assessment and appropriate action plans in accordance with our contingency funding plan.
market risk management we recognize that interest rate and foreign exchange risk is inherent in the business of banking due to the nature of the assets and liabilities of banks. banks typically manage the trade-off between near-term earnings volatility and market value volatility by targeting moderate levels of each. in addition to using industry accepted techniques to analyze and measure interest rate and foreign exchange risk, we perform sensitivity analysis to identify our risk exposures under a broad range of scenarios. investment securities and derivatives are the main levers for the management of interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
the chief risk officer, in conjunction with the chief market and liquidity risk officer, is responsible for the establishment of market risk management policies and standards and for governance and monitoring of market risk at a corporate level. the chief financial officer is accountable for the management of market risk. we manage market risk exposure, which is principally driven by balance sheet interest rate risk, centrally and establish quantitative limits to control our exposure. market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our business operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives.
77      capital one financial corporation (cof)
the market risk positions of our banking entities and our total company are calculated separately and in total and are reported in comparison to pre-established limits to the asset liability committee monthly and to the risk committee of the board of directors no less than quarterly. management is authorized to utilize financial instruments as outlined in our policy to actively manage market risk exposure.
operational risk management we recognize the criticality of managing operational risk on a day-to-day basis and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. we have implemented appropriate operational risk management policies, standards, processes and tools to enable the delivery of high quality and consistent customer experiences.
the chief operational risk officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our operational risk management program. the program establishes and enforces requirements and practices for assessing the operational risk profile, executing key control processes for select operational risks, and reporting of operational risk results. these activities are executed in accordance with basel ii advanced approaches requirements.
reputation risk management we recognize that reputation risk is of particular concern for financial institutions as a result of the aftermath of the financial crisis and economic downturn, which has resulted in increased scrutiny and widespread regulatory changes. we manage both strategic and tactical reputation issues and build our relationships with the government, media, consumer advocates, and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both our company and industry. our actions include implementing pro-consumer practices in our business and taking public positions in support of better consumer practices in our industry. the general counsel is responsible for managing our overall reputation risk program. day-to-day activities are controlled by the frameworks set forth in our reputation risk management policy and other risk management policies.
strategic risk management capital one monitors external market and industry developments to identify potential areas of strategic opportunity or risk. these items provide input for development of the company's strategy led by the chief executive officer and other senior executives. through the ongoing development and vetting of the corporate strategy, the chief risk officer identifies and assesses risks associated with the strategy across all risk categories and monitors them throughout the year.
credit risk profile our loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. our lending activities are governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics.
we also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk, including the purchase of securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, foreign exchange transactions, and customer overdrafts. we provide additional information on credit risk related to our investment securities portfolio under "consolidated balance sheets analysis-investment securities" and credit risk related to derivative transactions in "note 10-derivative instruments and hedging activities."
primary loan products we provide a variety of lending products. our primary loan products include credit cards, auto, home loans and commercial.
•   credit cards: we originate both prime and subprime credit cards through a variety of channels. our credit cards generally have variable interest rates. credit card accounts are underwritten using an automated underwriting system based on predictive models that we have developed. the underwriting criteria, which are customized for individual products and marketing programs, are established based on an analysis of the net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to a further analysis using a variety of stress conditions. underwriting decisions are generally based on credit bureau information, including payment history, debt burden and credit scores, such as fico, and on other factors, such as applicant income. we maintain a credit card securitization program and selectively sell charged-off credit card loans.
78      capital one financial corporation (cof)
•   auto: we originate both prime and subprime auto loans. customers are acquired through a network of auto dealers and direct marketing. our auto loans generally have fixed interest rates and loan terms of 72 months or less. loan size limits are customized by program and are generally less than $75,000. similar to credit card accounts, the underwriting criteria are customized for individual products and marketing programs and based on analysis of net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions. underwriting decisions are generally based on an applicant's income, estimated debt-to-income ratio, and credit bureau information, along with collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value ("ltv") ratio. we generally retain all of our auto loans, though we have securitized and sold auto loans in the past and may do so in the future.
•   home loans: most of the existing home loans in our loan portfolio were originated by banks we acquired. the underwriting standards for these loans were less restrictive than our current underwriting standards. currently, we originate residential mortgage and home equity loans through our branches, direct marketing, and dedicated home loan officers. our home loan products include conforming and non-conforming fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans, as well as first and second lien home equity loans and lines of credit. in general, our underwriting policy limits for these loans include: (1) a maximum ltv ratio of 80% for loans without mortgage insurance; (2) a maximum ltv ratio of 95% for loans with mortgage insurance or for home equity products; (3) a maximum debt-to-income ratio of 50%; and (4) a maximum loan amount of $3 million. our underwriting procedures are intended to verify the income of applicants and obtain appraisals to determine home values. we may, in limited instances, use automated valuation models to determine home values. our underwriting standards for conforming loans are designed to meet the underwriting standards required by the agencies at a minimum, and we sell most of our conforming loans to the agencies. we generally retain non-conforming mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit.
•   commercial: we offer a range of commercial lending products, including loans secured by commercial real estate and loans to middle market industrial and service companies. our commercial loans may have a fixed or variable interest rate; however, the majority of our commercial loans have variable rates. our underwriting standards require an analysis of the borrower's financial condition and prospects, as well as an assessment of the industry in which the borrower operates. where relevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying collateral and guarantees. we maintain underwriting guidelines and limits for major types of borrowers and loan products that specify, where applicable, guidelines for debt service coverage, leverage, ltv ratio and standard covenants and conditions. we assign a risk rating and establish a monitoring schedule for loans based on the risk profile of the borrower, industry segment, source of repayment, the underlying collateral and guarantees (if any) and current market conditions. although we generally retain commercial loans, we may syndicate large positions for risk mitigation purposes. in addition, we originate and service multifamily commercial real estate loans which are sold to the government-sponsored enterprises.
loan portfolio composition our loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including restricted loans underlying our consolidated securitization trusts and loans held for sale. table 16 presents the composition of our portfolio of loans held for investment, including acquired loans, by portfolio segment, as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. table 16 and the credit metrics presented in this section exclude loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value and totaled $626 million and $218 million as of december 31, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

we market our credit card products throughout the united states, canada and the united kingdom. our credit card loan portfolio is geographically diversified due to our product and marketing approach, with higher concentrations in california, new york, texas, florida, illinois, pennsylvania and ohio.
our auto loan portfolio is originated in most regions of the united states with a concentration in texas, california, florida, georgia, louisiana, illinois and ohio. our home loan portfolio is concentrated in california, new york, illinois, maryland, virginia, new jersey and florida, which reflects the characteristics of the ing direct portfolio that comprises the majority of our home loans. retail banking includes small business loans and other consumer lending products originated through our branch network with a concentration in louisiana, new york, texas, new jersey, maryland, virginia and california.
we operate our commercial banking business primarily in geographic regions where we maintain retail bank branches. accordingly, the portfolio is concentrated in new york, louisiana and texas, which represent our largest retail banking markets. our small ticket commercial real estate portfolio, which was originated on a national basis through a broker network, is in a run-off mode.
we provide additional information on the geographic concentration, by loan category, of our loan portfolio in "note 4-loans."
acquired loans our portfolio of loans held for investment includes loans acquired in the ing direct, ccb and 2012 u.s. card acquisitions. these loans were recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition. acquired loans accounted for based on expected cash flows to be collected was $23.5 billion as of december 31, 2014, compared to $28.6 billion as of december 31, 2013.
the difference between the fair value at acquisition and expected cash flows represents the accretable yield, which is recognized in interest income over the life of the loans. the difference between the contractual payments on the loans and expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. we regularly update our estimate of expected principal and interest to be collected from these loans and evaluate the results for each accounting pool that was established at acquisition based on loans with common risk characteristics. probable decreases in expected cash flows would trigger the recognition of an allowance for loan and lease
80      capital one financial corporation (cof)
losses through our provision for credit losses. probable and significant increases in expected cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses established subsequent to acquisition, with any remaining increase in expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the underlying loans. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for additional information on acquired loans.
home loans the substantial majority of our home loan portfolio was acquired in the ing direct and ccb acquisitions, and they accounted for 98.9% and 98.7% of our total acquired loans as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the expected cash flows for our acquired home loan portfolio are significantly impacted by future expectations of home prices and interest rates. decreases in expected cash flows that result from declining conditions, particularly associated with these variables, could result in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses and reduction in accretable yield.
charge-offs on these loans are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference is depleted. in addition, acquired loans are not initially classified as delinquent or nonperforming as we expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference is expected to absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans. the period-end carrying value of acquired loans in our home loan portfolio was $23.2 billion and $28.2 billion as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

(1)   due to the revolving nature of credit card loans, we report the majority of our variable-rate credit card loans as due in one year or less. we report fixed-rate credit card loans with introductory rates that expire after a certain period of time as due in one year or less. we assume that the rest of our remaining fixed-rate credit card loans will mature within one to three years.
(2)   we report the maturity period for the home loans portfolio included in the consumer banking business based on the earlier of the next re-pricing or contractual maturity date of the loan.
credit risk measurement we closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. key metrics we track in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans. trends in delinquency rates are a primary indicator of credit risk within our consumer loan portfolios, as changes in delinquency rates provide an early warning of changes in credit losses. the primary indicator of credit risk in our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings. because we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming, the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. in addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of our loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on regional economic conditions.

we underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which are typically based on credit bureau data, including borrower credit scores, along with application information and, where applicable, collateral, and deal structure data. we continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. we use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking, and in some cases to drive product segmentation decisions.

(1)   credit scores generally represent fico scores. these scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. we approximate non-fico credit scores to comparable fico scores for consistency. balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category.
(2)   credit scores represent fico scores. these scores are obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. the fico score distribution in the table above is based on the average scores. balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category.
we present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. we also present adjusted credit quality metrics excluding the impact from acquired loans.
see "note 4-loans" in this report for additional credit quality information. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for information on our accounting policies for delinquent, nonperforming loans, net charge-offs and tdrs for each of our loan categories.
delinquency rates we consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer's due date, measured at the reporting date. our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include loans that are 30 or more days past due but currently classified as performing and accruing interest. the 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are generally the same for credit card loans, as we continue to classify the substantial majority of credit card loans as performing until the account is charged-off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories.

table 23 summarizes loans that were 90 days or more past due as to interest or principal and still accruing interest as of december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. these loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between 90 days and 179 days past due. as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the ffiec, we generally continue to accrue interest and fees on domestic credit card loans through the date of charge-off, which is typically in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. while domestic credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until the loan is charged-off, we reduce the balance of our credit card receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.

nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, foreclosed property and repossessed assets and the net realizable value of auto loans that have been charged-off as a result of a bankruptcy. nonperforming loans generally include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and certain restructured loans whose contractual terms have been modified in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories.

(1)   we recognized interest income for loans classified as nonperforming of $38 million and $40 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. interest income forgone related to nonperforming loans was $49 million and $55 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. forgone interest income represents the amount of interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms.
(2)   the nonperforming loan ratio, excluding acquired loans' impact for our home loan portfolio, total consumer banking, and total nonperforming loans held for investment was 4.86%, 1.14%, and 0.44%, respectively, as of december 31, 2014, compared to 5.29%, 1.44%, and 0.51%, respectively, as of december 31, 2013.
(3)   nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment, excluding the impact of domestic credit card loans, was 0.62% and 0.70% as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
(4)   the denominator used in calculating the nonperforming asset ratios consists of total loans held for investment and other nonperforming assets.
(5)   includes foreclosed properties related to acquired loans of $101 million and $68 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

net charge-offs net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. we exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and fraud losses from charge-offs. net charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expenses and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories.

loan modifications and restructurings as part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (three to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral.

(1)   amount reflects the total outstanding customer balance, which consists of unpaid principal balance, accrued interest and fees.
the majority of our credit card tdrs involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. we determine the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment on modified loans that involve a reduction and are considered to be a tdr based on the interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan entering the modification program. in some cases, the interest rate on a credit card account is automatically increased due to non-payment, late payment or similar events. in all cases, we cancel the customer's available line of credit on the credit card. if the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, with the amount of any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category. the loan amount may then be charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy.
within the consumer banking business, the majority of our modified loans receive an extension, while a portion receive an interest rate reduction or principal reduction. their impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows, or a collateral evaluation for auto and home loans that were charged down to fair value. in the commercial banking business, the majority of modified loans receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction. the impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value. we provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as tdrs, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification, in "note 4-loans."
impaired loans a loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. generally, we report loans as impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. loans defined as individually impaired include larger balance commercial nonperforming loans and tdrs. loans held for sale are not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value. impaired loans also exclude acquired loans accounted for based on expected cash flows because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred, as discussed above under "summary of selected financial data."

impaired loans, including tdrs, totaled $1.9 billion as of both december 31, 2014 and 2013. tdrs accounted for $1.7 billion of impaired loans as of both december 31, 2014 and 2013. we provide additional information on our impaired loans, including the allowance for loan and lease losses established for these loans, in "note 4-loans" and "note 5-allowance for loan and lease losses."
allowance for loan and lease losses our allowance for loan and lease losses represents management's best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent in our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. the allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge-offs. we provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses in "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies."
our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $68 million to $4.4 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $4.3 billion as of december 31, 2013. the allowance coverage ratio declined to 2.10% as of december 31, 2014, from 2.19% as of december 31, 2013. the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by loan growth in our domestic card, auto and commercial loan portfolios, in addition to portfolio specific risks in our commercial loan portfolio, offset by credit improvement driving allowance releases related to our international card portfolio.

liquidity risk profile we have established liquidity practices that are intended to ensure we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. our practices include maintaining an adequate liquidity reserve to cover our funding requirements as well as any potential deposit run-off and maintaining access to diversified funding sources to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. our liquidity reserves consist of readily-marketable or pledgable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed.

(1)   the weighted average life of our securities was approximately 5.7 years and 6.3 years as of december 31, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
(2)   we pledged securities available for sale with a fair value of $3.5 billion and $10.7 billion as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we also pledged securities held to maturity with a carrying value of $9.0 billion and $8.2 billion as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, $14 million of the pledged securities available for sale were used to secure our fhlb borrowing capacity.
our liquidity reserves increased by $1.9 billion, or 3%, to $71.6 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $69.7 billion as of december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of our investment securities, partially offset by higher fhlb advances to fund the growth of our credit card portfolio. see "md&a-risk management" for additional information on our management of liquidity risk.
funding the company's primary source of funding comes from deposits. in addition to deposits, the company raises funding through the purchase of federal funds, the issuance of brokered deposits, fhlb advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios, the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, the issuance of securitized debt obligations and other borrowings. a key objective in our use of these markets is to ensure we maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources.
deposits our deposits provide a stable and relatively low cost of funds and are our largest source of funding.

(3)   substantially all of our foreign time deposits were greater than $100,000 as of december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
our deposits include brokered deposits, which we obtained through the use of third-party intermediaries. those brokered deposits are reported as saving deposits and time deposits in the above table and totaled $5.1 billion and $6.0 billion as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the fdic limits the use of brokered deposits to "well-capitalized" insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the fdic, to "adequately capitalized" institutions. cobna and cona were "well-capitalized," as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of both december 31, 2014, and 2013 and therefore were permitted to maintain brokered deposits.

table 31 presents the contractual maturities of large-denomination domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. our funding and liquidity management activities factor into the expected maturities of these deposits. based on past activity, we expect to retain a portion of these deposits as they mature. accordingly, we expect the actual net cash outflows will be less than the contractual maturity amounts.

short-term borrowings and long-term debt we access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligation transactions, and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. in addition, we may utilize short-term and long-term fhlb advances secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and home equity lines of credit.
our short-term borrowings include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. the short-term borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and short-term fhlb advances, increased by $865 million in 2014, to $17.1 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $16.2 billion as of december 31, 2013. this increase reflects $40.1 billion in new fhlb advances, partially offset by $39.2 billion in payoffs in 2014.
our long-term debt, which consists of securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and long-term fhlb advances, increased by $7.0 billion in 2014, to $31.4 billion as of december 31, 2014, from $24.4 billion as of december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to new senior unsecured debt issuances of $7.8 billion and securitized debt issuances of $4.3 billion, partially offset by $2.4 billion and $3.0 billion of senior and subordinated note and securitized debt maturities, respectively.
table 32 provides the average balance and average interest rate of our short-term borrowings for 2014, 2013 and 2012. this table also presents the period-end balance, weighted average interest rate and the maximum month-end outstanding amount of our short-borrowings as of december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. our short-term borrowings typically have not represented a significant portion of our overall funding.

we provide additional information on our short-term borrowings and long-term debt under "consolidated balance sheets analysis-securitized debt obligations," "consolidated balance sheets analysis-other debt" and in "note 9-deposits and borrowings."
borrowing capacity we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec on april 30, 2012, which expires in april 2015. under this shelf registration, we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. there is no limit under this shelf registration statement to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. we expect to file a new shelf registration statement prior to the expiration of our existing shelf registration statement.
in addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statement, we also have access to fhlb advances with a maximum borrowing capacity of $29.6 billion as of december 31, 2014, of which $11.8 billion was still available to us to borrow as of december 31, 2014. to secure this borrowing capacity, we pledged loan collateral with an outstanding balance of $36.7 billion

and security collateral with a fair value of $14 million as of december 31, 2014. the ability to draw down funding is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the banks' ability to post collateral. our fhlb membership is secured by our investment in fhlb stock of $807 million and $774 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which are determined in part based on our outstanding advances. we also have access to the federal reserve discount window through which we had borrowing capacity of $9.3 billion as of december 31, 2014. although available, we do not view this borrowing capacity as a primary source of liquidity and did not utilize it during 2014 or 2013.
credit ratings our credit ratings have a significant impact on our ability to access capital markets and our non-deposit borrowing costs. rating agencies base their ratings on numerous factors, including liquidity, capital adequacy, asset quality, quality of earnings and the probability of systemic support. significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings. such ratings help to support our cost effective unsecured funding as part of our overall financing programs. table 34 provides a summary of the credit ratings for the senior unsecured debt of capital one financial corporation, cobna and cona as of december 31, 2014 and 2013.

market risk profile market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. below we provide additional information about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures we use to evaluate our market risk exposure.
primary market risk exposures our primary source of market risk is interest rate risk. we also have exposure to foreign exchange risk.
interest rate risk interest rate risk, which represents exposure to instruments whose yield or price varies with the volatility of interest rates, is our most significant source of market risk exposure. banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities.
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. our primary exposure is related to the funding of and non-dollar net investments in our international card business in the u.k and canada. our intercompany funding exposes our income statement to foreign exchange transaction risk, while our equity investments in our foreign operations results in translation risk in aoci. we manage our transaction risk by entering into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign currency denominated intercompany borrowings. in the third quarter of 2014, we began entering into net investment hedges to manage our aoci exposure. we apply hedge accounting to these net investment hedges. we measure our total exposure by regularly tracking the value of our net equity invested in our foreign operations as well as their funding requirements.
also, beginning in the third quarter of 2014, we revised our methodology to measure our exposure to foreign exchange rates by measuring the change in equity value of our net investments in our u.k. and canadian operations. we apply a 30 percent u.s. dollar appreciation shock against each of our great british pound ("gbp") and canadian dollar ("cad") net investment exposure. this value-at-risk analysis approximates a 99 percent confidence interval over a one year time horizon for our combined gbp and cad net investment exposure. as of december 31, 2014 our gross equity exposures were 1.3 billion gbp and 581 million cad. as a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal. our gross equity exposures as of december 31, 2013 were 1.2 billion gbp and 655 million cad.
market risk management we employ several techniques to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk, which include, but are not limited to, altering the duration and re-pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities through interest rate derivatives or mitigating the foreign exchange exposure of certain non-dollar denominated equity or transactions through derivatives. derivatives are one of the primary tools we use in managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk. our current asset/liability management policy includes the use of derivatives. we execute our derivative contracts in both over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative markets. although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps, we also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage both our interest rate and foreign currency risk. the outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts totaled $88.6 billion as of december 31, 2014, compared to $63.4 billion as of december 31, 2013, driven by an increase in our hedging activities.
97      capital one financial corporation (cof)
market risk measurement we have prescribed risk management policies and limits established by our market and liquidity risk policy and approved by the board of directors. our objective is to manage our asset/liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analysis to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar denominated earnings and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. we provide additional information below in "economic value of equity."
we consider the impact on both net interest income and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk. because the federal funds rate was lowered to near zero in december 2008 and since then has remained in a target range of 0% to 0.25%, we use a 50 basis points decrease as our declining interest rate scenario, since a scenario where interest rates would decline by 200 basis points is unlikely. in scenarios where a 50 basis points decline would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0%. below we discuss the assumptions used in calculating each of these measures.
net interest income sensitivity this sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month base-line interest rate sensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates. interest rate sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other non-interest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates, including changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and free-standing interest rate swaps. adjusted net interest income consists of net interest income and changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, including related derivative hedging activity, and changes in the fair value of free-standing interest rate swaps. in addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest rate sensitive revenue, we assume an instantaneous plus 200 basis points and minus 50 basis points shock, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above.
economic value of equity our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative hedging activity, resulting from movements in interest rates. our economic value of equity sensitivity measures are calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes. in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points and -50 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, we updated the models and associated assumptions for certain deposits in our consumer banking business. our new deposit model was developed based on account-level data and incorporates lagged responses in both repricing and customer behavior as external market rates change. the modeling changes had a small impact on our economic value of equity sensitivity measure, but resulted in a larger impact to our next 12-month net interest income sensitivity. accordingly, our net interest income sensitivity metric shows more asset sensitivity over the first 12 months, moving from 3.4% in a +200 basis point instantaneous parallel shock shift (under the previous methodology) to 4.5% using the new deposit model.

our projected net interest income and economic value of equity sensitivity measures were within our prescribed asset/liability policy limits as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. in addition to these industry standard measures, we will continue to factor into our internal interest rate risk management decisions the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios.
limitations of market risk measures the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. we regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities.
there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. the above sensitivity analysis contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis.

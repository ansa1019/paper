item 1a.   risk factors a description of factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results is provided below.
risks associated with our industry ongoing changes in the technology industry, as well as the semiconductor industry in particular, could expose our business to significant risks.
the semiconductor equipment industry and other industries that we serve are constantly developing and changing over time. many of the risks associated with operating in these industries are comparable to the risks faced by all technology companies, such as the uncertainty of future growth rates in the industries that we serve, pricing trends in the end-markets for consumer electronics and other products (which place a growing emphasis on our customers' cost of ownership), changes in our customers' capital spending patterns and, in general, an environment of constant change and development, including decreasing product and component dimensions; use of new materials; and increasingly complex device structures, applications and process steps. if we fail to appropriately adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to any of these trends, or, with respect to technological advances, if we do not timely develop new technologies and products that successfully anticipate and address these changes, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
in addition, we face a number of risks specific to ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry, as the significant majority of our sales are made to semiconductor manufacturers. some of the trends that our management monitors in operating our business include the following:
•   the increasing cost of building and operating fabrication facilities and the impact of such increases on our customers' investment decisions;
•   differing market growth rates and capital requirements for different applications, such as memory, logic and foundry;
•   the emergence of disruptive technologies that change the prevailing semiconductor manufacturing processes (or the economics associated with semiconductor manufacturing) and, as a result, also impact the inspection and metrology requirements associated with such processes;
•   the possible introduction of integrated products by our larger competitors that offer inspection and metrology functionality in addition to managing other semiconductor manufacturing processes;
•   changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes that are extremely costly for our customers to implement and, accordingly, impact the amount of their budgets that are available for process control equipment;
•   the possibility that next-generation technological advances within the semiconductor manufacturing industry could actually reverse the historical trend of declining cost per transistor, and the impact that such reversal would have upon our industry and business;
•   the bifurcation of the semiconductor manufacturing industry into (a) leading edge manufacturers driving continued research and development into next-generation products and technologies and (b) other manufacturers that are content with existing (including previous generation) products and technologies;
•   the ever escalating cost of next-generation product development, which may result in joint development programs between us and our customers or government entities to help fund such programs that could restrict our control of, ownership of and profitability from the products and technologies developed through those programs;
•   the potential industry transition from 300mm to 450mm wafers; and
•   the entry by some semiconductor manufacturers into collaboration or sharing arrangements for capacity, cost or risk with other manufacturers, as well as increased outsourcing of their manufacturing activities, and greater focus only on specific markets or applications, whether in response to adverse market conditions or other market pressures.
any of the changes described above may negatively affect our customers' rate of investment in the capital equipment that we produce, which could result in downward pressure on our prices, customer orders, revenues and gross margins. if we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from any of these or other potential changes in our industries, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted.
15
we are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.
our customer base, particularly in the semiconductor industry, historically has been, and is becoming increasingly, highly concentrated. in this environment, orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of our sales. this increasing concentration exposes our business, financial condition and operating results to a number of risks, including the following:
•   the mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, which exposes our business and operating results to increased volatility tied to individual customers.
•   new orders from our foundry customers in the past several years have constituted a significant portion of our total orders. this concentration increases the impact that future business or technology changes within the foundry industry may have on our business, financial condition and operating results.
•   in a highly concentrated business environment, if a particular customer does not place an order, or if they delay or cancel orders, we may not be able to replace the business. furthermore, because our products are configured to customer specifications, any changes, delays or cancellations of orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs.
•   in recent years, our customer base has become increasingly concentrated due to corporate consolidation, acquisitions and business closures. as a result of this consolidation, the customers that survive the consolidation represent a greater portion of our sales. those surviving customers may have more aggressive policies regarding engaging alternative, second-source suppliers for the products we offer and, in addition, may seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us. any of these changes could negatively impact our prices, customer orders, revenues and gross margins.
•   certain customers have undergone significant ownership changes, created alliances with other companies, experienced management changes or have outsourced manufacturing activities, any of which may result in additional complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions.
•   the highly concentrated business environment also increases our exposure to risks related to the financial condition of each of our customers. for example, as a result of the challenging economic environment during fiscal year 2009, we were (and in some cases continue to be) exposed to additional risks related to the continued financial viability of certain of our customers. to the extent our customers experience liquidity issues in the future, we may be required to incur additional bad debt expense with respect to receivables owed to us by those customers. in addition, customers with liquidity issues may be forced to discontinue operations or may be acquired by one of our customers, and in either case such event would have the effect of further consolidating our customer base.
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical. the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide. if we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business could be seriously harmed.
the timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict. the cyclical nature of the primary industry in which we operate is largely a function of our customers' capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity, which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization, consumer demand for products, inventory levels and our customers' access to capital. this cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and, in some cases, future expense levels. during down cycles in our industry, the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted, which could result not only in a decrease in, or cancellation or delay of, orders (which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty) but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers. our ability to recognize revenue from a particular customer may also be negatively impacted by the customer's funding status, which could be weakened not only by adverse business conditions or inaccessibility to capital markets for any number of macroeconomic or company-specific reasons, but also by funding limitations imposed by the customer's unique corporate structure. any of these factors could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.
16
when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound. during periods of declining revenues, as was experienced during fiscal year 2009, we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees. if we fail to respond, or if our attempts to respond fail to accomplish our intended results, then our business could be seriously harmed. furthermore, any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges, disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel. in addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand. we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles. each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.
in addition, our management typically provides quarterly forecasts for certain financial metrics, which, when made, are based on business and operational forecasts that are believed to be reasonable at the time. however, largely due to the cyclicality of our business and the industries in which we operate, and the fact that business conditions in our industries can change very rapidly as part of these cycles, our actual results may vary (and have varied in the past) from forecasted results. these variations can occur for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, unexpected changes in the volume or timing of customer orders, product shipments or product acceptances; an inability to adjust our operations rapidly enough to adapt to changing business conditions; or a different than anticipated effective tax rate. the impact on our business of delays or cancellations of customer orders may be exacerbated by the short lead times that our customers expect between order placement and product shipment. this is because order delays and cancellations may lead not only to lower revenues, but also, due to the advance work we must do in anticipation of receiving a product order in order to meet the expected lead times, to significant inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease our gross margin. any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results for a particular quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from financial forecasts we have previously provided. we provide these forecasts with the intent of giving investors and analysts a better understanding of management's expectations for the future, but parties reviewing such forecasts must recognize that such forecasts are comprised of, and are themselves, forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this item 1a and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. if our operating or financial results for a particular period differ from our forecasts or the expectations of investment analysts, or if we revise our forecasts, the market price of our common stock could decline.
risks related to our business model and capital structure if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business could be seriously harmed.
success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends, in part, on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions. for example, the size of semiconductor devices continues to shrink, and the industry is currently transitioning to the use of new materials and innovative fab processes. while we expect these trends will increase our customers' reliance on diagnostic products such as ours, we cannot be sure that these trends will directly improve our business. these and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs and to cut back or discontinue older programs, which may no longer have industry-wide support. technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees. our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards, to develop and introduce new products that successfully address changing customer needs, to win market acceptance of these new products and to manufacture these new products in a timely and cost-effective manner.
in this environment, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance, features and functionality of our products, to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands. substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products. there can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements. in addition, we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us. our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products.
17
in addition, the complexity of our products exposes us to other risks. we regularly recognize revenue from a sale upon shipment of the applicable product to the customer (even before receiving the customer's formal acceptance of that product) in certain situations, including sales of products for which installation is considered perfunctory, transactions in which the product is sold to an independent distributor and we have no installation obligations, and sales of products where we have previously delivered the same product to the same customer location and that prior delivery has been accepted. however, our products are very technologically complex and rely on the interconnection of numerous subcomponents (all of which must perform to their respective specifications), so it is conceivable that a product for which we recognize revenue upon shipment may ultimately fail to meet the overall product's required specifications. in such a situation, the customer may be entitled to certain remedies, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results for various periods and, as a result, our stock price.
our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights. if we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology, we may lose valuable assets.
our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights. we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies. the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive, and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us. other companies and individuals, including our larger competitors, may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own, adversely affecting our business. in addition, we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers, and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product research and development projects. the termination of any such collaboration, or delays caused by disputes or other unanticipated challenges that may arise in connection with any such collaboration, could significantly impair our research and development efforts, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations.
we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation. however, we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties.
while patent, copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel. we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and through other security measures. we also maintain exclusive and non-exclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products. however, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing. in addition, the laws of certain territories in which we develop, manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states. in any event, the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited, and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors.
our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide.
our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide. some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support capabilities than we possess. we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services, some of which compete with the products and services that we offer. these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products, including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings. in addition, we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer, using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology, which is the result of continuing significant investments in product research and development. however, we may enter new markets, whether through acquisitions or new internal product development, in which competition is based primarily on product pricing, not technological superiority. further, some new growth markets that emerge may not require leading technologies. loss of competitive position in any of the markets we serve, or an inability to sell our products on favorable commercial terms in new markets we may enter, could negatively affect our prices, customer orders, revenues, gross margins and market share, any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.
18
our business would be harmed if we do not receive parts sufficient in number and performance to meet our production requirements and product specifications in a timely and cost-effective manner.
we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products, including custom electronic and mechanical components, and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials. we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers. because of the variability and uniqueness of customers' orders, we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing. through our business interruption planning, we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions and/or shortages of key parts by, among other things, monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers, identifying (but not necessarily qualifying) possible alternative suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts. although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers, key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. also, key parts we obtain from some of our suppliers incorporate the suppliers' proprietary intellectual property; in those cases we are increasingly reliant on third parties for high-performance, high-technology components, which reduces the amount of control we have over the availability and protection of the technology and intellectual property that is used in our products. in addition, if certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations, which is a heightened risk during economic downturns, that would affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our products. similarly, especially with respect to suppliers of high-technology components, our suppliers themselves have increasingly complex supply chains, and delays or disruptions at any stage of their supply chains may prevent us from obtaining parts in a timely manner and result in delays for our products. our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements and product specifications, or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms. furthermore, a supplier may discontinue production of a particular part for any number of reasons, including the supplier's financial condition or business operational decisions, which would require us to purchase, in a single transaction, a large number of such discontinued parts in order to ensure that a continuous supply of such parts remains available to our customers. such "end-of-life" parts purchases could result in significant expenditures by us in a particular period, and ultimately any unused parts may result in a significant inventory write-off in a future period, either of which could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the applicable periods.
if we fail to operate our business in accordance with our business plan, our operating results, business and stock price may be significantly and adversely impacted.
we attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually, revised frequently (generally quarterly), and reviewed by management even more frequently (at least monthly). our business plan is developed based on a number of factors, many of which require estimates and assumptions, such as our expectations of the economic environment, future business levels, our customers' willingness and ability to place orders, lead-times, and future revenue and cash flow. our budgeted operating expenses, for example, are based in part on our future revenue expectations. however, our ability to achieve our anticipated revenue levels is a function of numerous factors, including the volatile and cyclical nature of our primary industry, customer order cancellations, macroeconomic changes, operational matters regarding particular agreements, our ability to manage customer deliveries and resources for the installation and acceptance of our products (for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales), our ability to manage delays or accelerations by customers in taking deliveries and the acceptance of our products (for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales), our ability to operate our business and sales processes effectively, and a number of the other risk factors set forth in this item 1a.
because our expenses are in most cases relatively fixed in the short term, any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our operating results. similarly, if we fail to manage our expenses effectively or otherwise fail to maintain rigorous cost controls, we could experience greater than anticipated expenses during an operating period, which would also negatively affect our results of operations. if we fail to operate our business consistent with our business plan, our operating results in any period may be significantly and adversely impacted. such an outcome could cause customers, suppliers or investors to view us as less stable, or could cause us to fail to meet financial analysts' revenue or earnings estimates, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or stock price.
in addition, our management is constantly striving to balance the requirements and demands of our customers with the availability of resources, the need to manage our operating model and other factors. in furtherance of those efforts, we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing, deliveries, installations and payment scheduling. any such decisions may impact our ability to recognize revenue, including the fiscal period during which such revenue may be recognized, with respect to such products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or stock price.
19
there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts.
our board of directors first instituted a quarterly dividend during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2005. since that time, we have announced a number of increases in the amount of our quarterly dividend level. we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us. future dividends may be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development; legal risks; stock repurchase programs; changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; and changes to our business model. our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts. a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.
there are risks associated with our outstanding indebtedness.
as of june 30, 2014, we had $750 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness represented by our senior notes that will mature in 2018, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and the other risk factors discussed in this section. there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.
in addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. factors that can affect our credit rating include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy.
in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of our senior notes, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. we cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of the senior notes. our ability to repurchase the senior notes in such event may be limited by law, by the indenture associated with the senior notes, or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time. if we fail to repurchase the senior notes as required by the indenture, it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes which, in turn, may also constitute an event of default under other of our obligations.
we are exposed to risks related to our commercial terms and conditions, including our indemnification of third parties, as well as the performance of our products.
although our standard commercial documentation sets forth the terms and conditions that we intend to apply to commercial transactions with our business partners, counterparties to such transactions may not explicitly agree to our terms and conditions. in situations where we engage in business with a third party without an explicit master agreement regarding the applicable terms and conditions, or where the commercial documentation applicable to the transaction is subject to varying interpretations, we may have disputes with those third parties regarding the applicable terms and conditions of our business relationship with them. such disputes could lead to a deterioration of our commercial relationship with those parties, costly and time-consuming litigation, or additional concessions or obligations being offered by us to resolve such disputes, or could impact our revenue or cost recognition. any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, in our commercial agreements, from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers and lessors, with respect to certain matters. we have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. we may be compelled to enter into or accrue for probable settlements of alleged indemnification obligations, or we may be subject to potential liability arising from our customers' involvements in legal disputes. in addition, notwithstanding the provisions related to limitations on our liability that we seek to include in our business agreements, the counterparties to such agreements may dispute our interpretation or application of such provisions, and a court of law may not interpret or apply such provisions in our favor, any of which could result in an obligation for us to pay material damages to third parties and engage in costly legal proceedings. it is difficult to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations, whether or not asserted, due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in any particular claim. our business, financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims, regardless of their merit or outcomes.
20
we are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues. our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects, especially when products are first introduced. unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us, including increased service or warranty costs, providing product replacements for (or modifications to) defective products, litigation related to defective products, reimbursement for damages caused by our products, product recalls, or product write-offs or disposal costs. these costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business, financial condition and operating results. in addition, our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects, which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business.
furthermore, we occasionally enter into volume purchase agreements with our larger customers, and these agreements may provide for certain volume purchase incentives, such as credits toward future purchases. we believe that these arrangements are beneficial to our long-term business, as they are designed to encourage our customers to purchase higher volumes of our products. however, these arrangements could require us to recognize a reduced level of revenue for the products that are initially purchased, to account for the potential future credits or other volume purchase incentives. as a result, these volume purchase arrangements, while expected to be beneficial to our business over time, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in near-term periods, including the revenue we can recognize on product sales and therefore our gross margins.
in addition, we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain other types of customer-specific pricing, discount, rebate or credit commitments offered by us, which may adversely impact our revenues, margins or financial results. furthermore, we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments. if a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights, we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection, as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection. to date, we have made no accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency. while we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments, we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future. one significant customer recently exercised its audit rights, but we cannot predict the outcome of that audit at this time. our business, financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in supporting an audit or inspection, or defending or settling any purported claims, regardless of their merit or outcomes.
there are risks associated with our receipt of government funding for research and development.
we are exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies, both domestically and internationally. governments and government agencies typically have the right to terminate funding programs at any time in their sole discretion, or a project may be terminated by mutual agreement if the parties determine that the project's goals or milestones are not being achieved, so there is no assurance that these sources of external funding will continue to be available to us in the future. in addition, under the terms of these government grants, the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur, directly and indirectly, in connection with such programs. any such audit could result in modifications to, or even termination of, the applicable government funding program. for example, if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program, those costs would not be reimbursed, and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded. we do not know the outcome of any future audits. any adverse finding resulting from any such audit could lead to penalties (financial or otherwise), termination of funding programs, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from receiving future government funding from the applicable government or government agency, any of which could adversely impact our operating results, financial condition and ability to operate our business.
21
we have recorded significant restructuring, inventory write-off and asset impairment charges in the past and may do so again in the future, which could have a material negative impact on our business.
during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2009, we recorded material restructuring charges of $38.7 million related to our global workforce reduction, large excess inventory write-offs of $85.6 million, and material impairment charges of $446.7 million related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets. if we again encounter challenging economic conditions, we may implement additional cost reduction actions, discontinue certain business operations or make other organizational changes, which would require us to take additional, potentially material, restructuring charges related to, among other things, employee terminations or exit costs. we may also be required to write-off additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of service inventory decline. also, as our lead times from suppliers increase (due to the increasing complexity of the parts and components they provide) and the lead times demanded by our customers decrease (due to the time pressures they face when introducing new products or technology or bringing new facilities into production), we may be compelled to increase our commitments, and therefore our risk exposure, to inventory purchases to meet our customers' demands in a timely manner, and that inventory may need to be written-off if demand for the underlying product declines for any reason. such additional write-offs could constitute material charges.
as noted above, we recorded a material charge during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2009 related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets. goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. goodwill is not amortized, but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill. purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for long-lived assets. the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors, including revenue and market growth, operating cash flows, market multiples, and discount rates. a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we previously used to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets (and, as applicable, the amount of any previous impairment charge), could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge.
any such additional material charges, whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment, may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements.
we are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements.
we enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. in addition, we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions, any of which may prove not to be financially viable. if we were to stop entering into these factoring arrangements, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables. however, by entering into these arrangements, and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services, we are exposed to additional risks. if any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring or deposit arrangements, we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements or a lack of access to our funds, any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
we are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered.
in connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices, we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws, such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws. if we were to violate any such law, we might not only be subject to the significant penalties applicable to such violation, but our past settlements may also be impacted by such violation, which could give rise to additional government actions or other legal proceedings. any such additional actions or proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses, and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business. these expenditures and diversions, as well as an adverse resolution of any such action or proceeding, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
22
general commercial, operational, financial and regulatory risks we are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy.
the severe tightening of the credit markets, turmoil in the financial markets and weakening of the global economy that were experienced during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2009 contributed to slowdowns in the industries in which we operate, which slowdowns could recur or worsen if economic conditions were to deteriorate again.
the markets for semiconductors, and therefore our business, are ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses. economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending, which caused our customers to decrease, cancel or delay their equipment and service orders from us in the economic slowdown during fiscal year 2009. in addition, the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit that accompanied that slowdown made it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell. reduced demand, combined with delays in our customers' ability to obtain financing (or the unavailability of such financing), has at times in the past adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and therefore has harmed our business and operating results, and our operating results and financial condition may again be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels.
in addition, a decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments. our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities, money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments. although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due to the quality and (where applicable) credit ratings and government guarantees of the underlying investments, a decline in the capital and financial markets would adversely impact the market value of our investments and their liquidity. if the market value of such investments were to decline, or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions, we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales, either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
if we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states, and we maintain significant operations outside the united states. we are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations.
a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states, and we maintain significant operations outside the united states. we expect that these conditions will continue in the foreseeable future. managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents a number of challenges, including but not limited to:
•   managing cultural diversity and organizational alignment;
•   exposure to the unique characteristics of each region in the global semiconductor market, which can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period;
•   periodic local or international economic downturns;
•   potential adverse tax consequences, including withholding tax rules that may limit the repatriation of our earnings, and higher effective income tax rates in foreign countries where we do business;
•   government controls, either by the united states or other countries, that restrict our business overseas or the import or export of semiconductor products or increase the cost of our operations;
•   compliance with customs regulations in the countries in which we do business;
•   tariffs or other trade barriers (including those applied to our products or to parts and supplies that we purchase);
•   political instability, natural disasters, legal or regulatory changes, acts of war or terrorism in regions where we have operations or where we do business;
•   fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business. although we attempt to manage near-term currency risks through the use of hedging instruments, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate;
•   longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable outside of the united states;
•   difficulties in managing foreign distributors (including monitoring and ensuring our distributors' compliance with all applicable united states and local laws); and
•   inadequate protection or enforcement of our intellectual property and other legal rights in foreign jurisdictions.
any of the factors above could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations.
23
we might be involved in claims or disputes related to intellectual property or other confidential information that may be costly to resolve, prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition.
as is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry, from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information. in addition, we occasionally receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to intellectual property claims made against such customers by third parties. with respect to intellectual property infringement disputes, our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate. however, we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or, if obtained, will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur. the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could seriously harm our results of operations and financial condition. furthermore, we may potentially be subject to claims by customers, suppliers or other business partners, or by governmental law enforcement agencies, related to our receipt, distribution and/or use of third-party intellectual property or confidential information. legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their merit, and associated internal investigations with respect to intellectual property or confidential information disputes are often expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; may divert management's attention and other company resources; and/or may result in restrictions on our ability to sell our products, settlements on significantly adverse terms or adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines, any of which could have a significant negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings, claims or investigations. the instigation of legal proceedings or claims, our inability to favorably resolve or settle such proceedings or claims, or the determination of any adverse findings against us or any of our employees in connection with such proceedings or claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our business reputation.
we are exposed to various risks related to the legal (including environmental), regulatory and tax environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business.
we are subject to various risks related to compliance with new, existing, different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply, including environmental, safety, antitrust, anti-corruption/anti-bribery, unclaimed property and export control regulations. our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws, rules or regulations, or changes to existing laws, rules or regulations (including changes that result in inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules or regulations), in the countries in which we operate could result in violations of contractual or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to conduct our business. from time to time, we may receive inquiries or audit notices from governmental or regulatory bodies, or we may participate in voluntary disclosure programs, related to legal, regulatory or tax compliance matters, and these inquiries, notices or programs may result in significant financial cost (including investigation expenses, defense costs, assessments and penalties), reputational harm and other consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
our properties and many aspects of our business operations are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations, including those that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, gases and other substances. any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations or requirements may subject us to a range of consequences, including fines, suspension of certain of our business activities, limitations on our ability to sell our products, obligations to remediate environmental contamination, and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. in addition, changes in environmental regulations (including regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions) could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment, alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute (potentially more expensive and/or rarer) materials. further, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by any release, regardless of fault. we also face increasing complexity in our manufacturing, product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and prospective requirements relating to the materials composition of our products, including restrictions on lead and other substances and requirements to track the sources of certain metals and other materials. the cost of complying, or of failing to comply, with these and other regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to conduct our business.
24
in addition, we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment, contracts, product performance, product liability, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, unfair competition and other matters (in addition to proceedings and claims related to intellectual property matters, which are separately discussed elsewhere in this item 1a). these legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their merit, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend, divert management's attention and resources, and/or inhibit our ability to sell our products. there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims, which could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to operate our business.
recent regulations related to "conflict minerals" may force us to incur additional expenses, may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.
in august 2012, under the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010, the sec adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals (referred to as "conflict minerals," regardless of their actual country of origin) in their products. some of these metals are commonly used in electronic equipment and devices, including our products. these new requirements require companies to annually investigate, disclose and report whether or not such metals originated from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries. our first report was filed on june 2, 2014 for the 2013 calendar year. we have an extremely complex supply chain, with numerous suppliers (many of whom are not obligated by the new law to investigate their own supply chains) for the components and parts used in each of our products. as a result, we may incur significant costs to comply with the diligence and disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant metals used in our products. in addition, because our supply chain is so complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origin of all the relevant metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our business reputation. though we do not anticipate that our customers will need to know our conflict mineral status to satisfy their own sec reporting obligations (if any), we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers if they nonetheless require that we prove or certify that our products are "conflict free." key components and parts that can be shown to be "conflict free" may not be available to us in sufficient quantity, or at all, or may only be available at significantly higher cost to us. if we are not able to meet customer requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier. any of these outcomes could adversely impact our business, financial condition or operating results.
we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively, and if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our key employees, our sales and product development could be harmed.
our employees are vital to our success, and our key management, engineering and other employees are difficult to replace. we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees. further, we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees. the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel. if we are unable to retain key personnel, or if we are not able to attract, assimilate and retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future, our business and operations could be harmed.
we outsource a number of services to third-party service providers, which decreases our control over the performance of these functions. disruptions or delays at our third-party service providers could adversely impact our operations.
we outsource a number of services, including our transportation and logistics management of spare parts and certain accounting functions, to domestic and overseas third-party service providers. while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations, they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered. it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered, on our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions, or on our ability to ensure compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations. in addition, many of these outsourced service providers, including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage, employ "cloud computing" technology for such storage (which refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is not stored within the user's physical infrastructure but instead is delivered to and consumed by the user as an internet-based service). these providers' cloud computing systems may be susceptible to "cyber incidents," such as intentional cyber attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cyber-security compromises, that are outside of our control. if we do not effectively develop and manage our outsourcing strategies, if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if our third-party service providers do not perform as anticipated or do not adequately protect our data from cyber-related security breaches, or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes, we may experience operational difficulties (such as limitations on our ability to ship products), increased costs, manufacturing or service interruptions or delays, loss of intellectual property rights or other sensitive data, quality and compliance issues, and challenges in managing our product inventory or recording and reporting financial and management information, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
25
we rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operations. our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operations.
our global operations are linked by information systems, including telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, network communications, email and various computer hardware and software applications. despite our implementation of network security measures, our tools and servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems and tools located at customer sites, or could be subject to system failures or malfunctions for other reasons. system failures or malfunctioning, such as difficulties with our customer relationship management ("crm") system, could disrupt our operations and our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our financial results. our enterprise resource planning ("erp") system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records, record transactions, provide critical information to our management, and prepare our financial statements. any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our erp system or other systems (whether in connection with the regular operation, periodic enhancements, modifications or upgrades of such systems or the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems) could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes, such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. any such event could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but, because of the uncertainties involved, we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses. we are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter.
in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources, part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources. as part of this effort, we may make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses with complementary products, services and/or technologies. there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful. in addition, we may use equity to finance future acquisitions, which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current stockholders.
if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses or if acquired businesses perform poorly, then our business and financial results may suffer. it is possible that the businesses we have acquired, as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future, may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than anticipated. in addition, we may lose key employees of the acquired companies. as a result, risks associated with acquisition transactions may give rise to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons, including:
•   we may have to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to acquired businesses;
•   the combination of businesses may cause the loss of key personnel or an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our company and/or the acquired business;
•   we may not be able to realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from our acquisitions;
•   we may experience challenges in entering into new market segments for which we have not previously manufactured and sold products;
•   we may face difficulties in coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities;
•   the customers, distributors, suppliers, employees and others with whom the companies we acquire have business dealings may have a potentially adverse reaction to the acquisition;
•   we may have to write-off goodwill or other intangible assets; and
•   we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions.
at times, we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers, suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property. these alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary, highly sensitive information. the success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners. mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks, and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
26
disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations, or in the operations of our customers, due to earthquake, flood, other natural catastrophic events, health epidemics or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders, delays in deliveries or other business activities, or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business.
we have significant manufacturing operations in the united states, singapore, israel, germany and china. in addition, our business is international in nature, with our sales, service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world. operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors, as well as our other operations and those of our customers, are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, health epidemics, fire, earthquake, volcanic eruptions, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters. such disruption could cause delays in, among other things, shipments of products to our customers, our ability to perform services requested by our customers, or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites. we cannot ensure that alternate means of conducting our operations (whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise) would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that, if such alternate means were available, they could be obtained on favorable terms.
in addition, as part of our cost-cutting actions, we have consolidated several operating facilities. our california operations are now primarily centralized in our milpitas facility. the consolidation of our california operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described above, such as acts of war or terrorism, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters, if any such event were to impact our milpitas facility.
we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war. if international political instability continues or increases, our business and results of operations could be harmed.
the threat of terrorism targeted at, or acts of war in, the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets. any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business. increased international political instability in various parts of the world, disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations. we maintain significant manufacturing and research and development operations in israel, an area that has historically experienced a high degree of political instability, and we are therefore exposed to risks associated with future instability in that region. such instability could directly impact our ability to operate our business (or our customers' ability to operate their businesses) in the affected region, cause us to incur increased costs in transportation, make such transportation unreliable, increase our insurance costs, and cause international currency markets to fluctuate. such instability could also have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products. if international political instability continues or increases in any region in which we do business, our business and results of operations could be harmed. we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war.
we self-insure certain risks including earthquake risk. if one or more of the uninsured events occurs, we could suffer major financial loss.
we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks; however, certain risks are uninsurable, are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance. accordingly, we may experience a loss that is not covered by insurance, either because we do not carry applicable insurance or because the loss exceeds the applicable policy amount or is less than the deductible amount of the applicable policy. for example, we do not currently hold earthquake insurance. an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations, a significant portion of which are conducted in california, an area highly susceptible to earthquakes. it could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products, much of which is also conducted in california. we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake, but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake. we self-insure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market. certain other risks are also self-insured either based on a similar cost-benefit analysis, or based on the unavailability of insurance. if one or more of the uninsured events occurs, we could suffer major financial loss.
27
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. although we hedge certain currency risks, we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries.
we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the euro and the japanese yen. we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally. in addition, an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the united states, and many of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies. we routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations, but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations. to the extent that these hedges are inadequate or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place, our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected. furthermore, if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses.
we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the market values of our portfolio investments; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings. in addition, we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock.
our investment portfolio primarily consists of both corporate and government debt securities that have a maximum effective maturity of three years. the longer the duration of these securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. as market interest rates and bond yields increase, those securities with a lower yield-at-cost show a mark-to-market unrealized loss. we have the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity. however, an impairment of the fair market value of our investments, even if unrealized, must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period.
in addition, the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years. the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors, including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate, fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets, our operating results or other performance metrics, or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a. volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other companies.
we are exposed to risks in connection with tax and regulatory compliance audits in various jurisdictions.
we are subject to tax and regulatory compliance audits (such as related to customs or product safety requirements) in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes, penalties, fines or other prohibitions against us. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and that our products and practices comply with applicable regulations, the final determination of any such audit and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals related to income taxes and other contingencies. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
a change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business.
we earn profits in, and are therefore potentially subject to taxes in, the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including singapore, israel and the cayman islands, the countries in which we earn the majority of our non-u.s. profits. due to economic, political or other conditions, tax rates in those jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. a number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates, such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the tax rates imposed by those jurisdictions; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits; changes in stock-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws (for example, proposals for fundamental united states international tax reform); changes in generally accepted accounting principles; and the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes. a change in our effective tax rate can materially and adversely impact our results from operations.
28
compliance with federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as nasdaq requirements, is becoming increasingly complex, and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business.
federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as nasdaq rules and regulations, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers, chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations. these laws, rules and regulations have increased, and in the future are expected to continue to increase, the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices, which could harm our results of operations and divert management's attention from business operations.
a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices (or changes in interpretations of such standards, practices or rules) can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective.
new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and will continue to occur in the future. changes to (or revised interpretations or applications of) existing tax or accounting rules or the questioning of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data," in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in item 1a, "risk factors" and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. (see "special note regarding forward-looking statements.")
critical accounting estimates and policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. actual results could differ from those estimates. we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis, and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this annual report on form 10-k. the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:
revenue recognition. we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. we derive revenue from three sources-sales of systems, spare parts and services. in general, we recognize revenue for systems when the system has been installed, is operating according to predetermined specifications and is accepted by the customer. when a customer delays installation for delivered products for which we have demonstrated a history of successful installation and acceptance, we recognize revenue upon customer acceptance. under certain circumstances, however, we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer, as follows:
•   when the customer fab has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria.
•   when system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due based upon shipment.
•   when the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory.
•   when the customer withholds acceptance due to issues unrelated to product performance, in which case revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets predetermined specifications.
in circumstances in which we recognize revenue prior to installation, the portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.
in many instances, products are sold in stand-alone arrangements. services are sold separately through renewals of annual maintenance contracts. we also allow for multiple element revenue arrangements in cases where certain elements of a sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. to determine the relative fair value of each element in a revenue arrangement, we allocate arrangement consideration based on the selling price hierarchy. for substantially all of the arrangements with multiple deliverables pertaining to products and services, we use vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe") or third-party evidence ("tpe") to allocate the selling price to each deliverable. we determine tpe based on historical prices charged for products and services when sold on a stand-alone basis. when we are unable to establish relative selling price using vsoe or tpe, we use estimated selling price ("esp") in our allocation of arrangement consideration. the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. esp could potentially be used for new or customized products. we regularly review relative selling prices and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates. in a multiple element revenue arrangement, we defer revenue recognition associated with the relative fair value of each undelivered element until that element is delivered to the customer. to be considered a separate element, the product or service in question must represent a separate unit of accounting, which means that such product or service must fulfill the following criteria: (a) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis; and (b) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. if the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria, the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until all elements are accepted by the customer.
35
trade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. we estimate the value of the trade-in right and reduce the revenue recognized on the initial sale. this amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right.
spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.
service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including consulting and training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured.
we sell stand-alone software that is subject to the software revenue recognition guidance. we periodically review selling prices to determine whether vsoe exists, and in some situations where we are unable to establish vsoe for undelivered elements, such as post-contract service, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract.
we also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for 12 months. non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences.
the deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment, less applicable product and warranty costs. deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met our revenue recognition criteria. deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to certain customers in japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. shipments to such customers in japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance.
we enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. additionally, judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. while changes in the allocation of the estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.
inventories. inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. we write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and parts inventory based on forecasted usage. these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.
warranty. we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. we update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis. the actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. see note 13, "commitments and contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description.

allowance for doubtful accounts. a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. in order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition. an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable. the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. we take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. if circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to record additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income.
stock-based compensation. we account for stock-based awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards. the fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period. the fair value is determined using a black-scholes valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan. the black-scholes option-pricing model requires the input of assumptions, including the option's expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. the expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market-based historical implied volatility from traded options of our common stock. the fair value for restricted stock units granted without "dividend equivalent" rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units, adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on the restricted stock units. the fair value for restricted stock units granted with "dividend equivalent" rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. the award holder is not entitled to receive payments under dividend equivalent rights unless the associated restricted stock unit award vests (i.e., the award holder is entitled to receive credits, payable in cash or shares of our common stock, equal to the cash dividends that would have been received on the shares of our common stock underlying the restricted stock units had the shares been issued and outstanding on the dividend record date, but such dividend equivalents are only paid subject to the recipient satisfying the vesting requirements of the underlying award). we have elected not to include the indirect tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions when calculating the windfall benefits and therefore recognize the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period in which the taxable event occurs.
accounting for cash-based long-term incentive compensation. cash-based long-term incentive ("cash lti") awards issued to employees under our cash lti program vest in four equal installments, with 25% of the aggregate amount of the cash lti award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a four-year period. in order to receive payments under a cash lti award, participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date. compensation expense related to the cash lti awards is recognized over the vesting term, which is adjusted for the impact of estimated forfeitures.
contingencies and litigation. we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. we accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. see note 13, "commitments and contingencies" and note 14, "litigation and other legal matters" to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description.
goodwill and intangible assets. we assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. long-lived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. see note 6, "goodwill and purchased intangible assets" to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. we performed our annual qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit in our second quarter of fiscal year 2014 and concluded that there was no impairment. there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to our annual impairment test. the next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ending june 30, 2015.
if we were to encounter challenging economic conditions, such as a decline in our operating results, an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment, a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, we may be required to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. in addition, if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets, we may be required to record goodwill and/or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would occur or, if it does, whether such charge would be material to our results of operations.
37
income taxes. we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. the guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. we have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. however, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable.
on a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. if actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
valuation of marketable securities. our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders' equity. however, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or an impairment charge is recognized. realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security's cost basis. we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made. in making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, default and loss rates of the underlying collateral, structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist. our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.
effects of recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted in december 2011, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued an accounting standard update requiring enhanced disclosure about certain financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the balance sheet or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement. we adopted the disclosure requirement in the first quarter of our fiscal year ended june 30, 2014, and it did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in february 2013, the fasb issued an accounting standard update on the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income of various components, which was originally deferred by the fasb in december 2011. the february 2013 update did not change the then current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. however, this update required an entity to present parenthetically (on the face of the financial statements, in the notes or, in some cases, cross-referenced to related footnote disclosures) significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification. the amendment reflected in the february 2013 update was adopted by us in the first quarter of our fiscal year ended june 30, 2014, and it did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it was disclosure-only in nature.
38
updates not yet effective in july 2013, the fasb issued an accounting standard update that provides explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists. under the new standard update, in most circumstances, an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in a company's financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward. this accounting standard update will be effective for our interim period ending september 30, 2014 and applied prospectively with early adoption permitted. we do not anticipate that this accounting standard update will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
in may 2014, the fasb issued an accounting standard update regarding revenue from customer contracts to transfer goods and services or non-financial assets, unless the contracts are covered by other standards (for example, insurance or lease contracts). under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the updates are effective for us beginning the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30, 2018. early adoption is not permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.
in june 2014, the fasb issued an accounting standard update regarding stock-based compensation that clarifies the accounting when terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. the amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting which could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. the update is effective for us beginning the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30, 2017, with early adoption permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.
executive summary kla-tencor corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. our broad portfolio of defect inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings, primarily supports ic manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process, from research and development to final volume production. we provide leading-edge equipment, software and support that enable ic manufacturers to identify, resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost. in addition to serving the semiconductor industry, we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries, including led and data storage industries, as well as general materials research.
our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer, ic, lithography reticle ("reticle" or "mask") and disk manufacturers around the world. our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure and control nanometric-level manufacturing processes, and to detect, analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment. our revenues are driven largely by our customers' spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies, or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand. our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets -- memory, foundry and logic. all three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in end-user demand, which influence the level and pattern of our customers' spending on our products and services. although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical, the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics, communications, data processing, and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions.
as we are a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time, thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability. as our customer base becomes increasingly more concentrated, large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales, which potentially exposes us to more volatility for revenues and earnings. in addition, we are subject to the cyclical capital spending that has historically characterized the semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries. the timing, length, intensity and volatility of the capacity-oriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable.
39
however, in addition to these trends of consolidation and cyclicality, the semiconductor industry has also been significantly impacted by constant technological innovation. the growing use of increasingly sophisticated semiconductor devices has caused many of our customers to invest in additional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and capacity. these investments have included process control and yield management equipment and services and have had a significant favorable impact on our revenues over the long term.
over the past four years, we have experienced high levels of customer demand for our products, a result of growth in increasingly sophisticated mobile devices incorporating advanced ics. the demand for our products is driven by our customers' needs to solve the process challenges that they face as they adopt new technologies required to fabricate these advanced ics. we cannot predict the duration and sustainability of the recent favorable business conditions, and our revenue levels in the next fiscal year will depend upon whether our customers maintain recent levels of investment in process control equipment. our earnings for the next fiscal year will depend not only on our revenue levels, but also on the amount of research and development spending required to meet our customers' technology roadmaps. we have continued to scale our production volumes and capacity to meet anticipated customer requirements and remain at risk of incurring significant inventory-related and other restructuring charges if business conditions deteriorate. we believe that, over the long term, our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications, as well as to reduce cost. we expect, particularly among our foundry and logic customers, that this in turn will drive high levels of long-term adoption of process control equipment and services that reduce semiconductor defectivity and improve manufacturing yields, reinforcing the longer-term growth drivers in our industry.
the following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years:

total revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 increased by 3% compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013, as our customers continued to invest in process control and services to improve manufacturing yields as they adopt advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules required to fabricate advanced ics.
total revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2012. revenue decreases from sales of both our defect inspection and metrology products for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 reflected typical cyclicality in capacity-oriented capital spending by logic and memory chip manufacturers, as well as delays in the procurement of next-generation equipment required to facilitate the transition to extreme ultraviolet lithography.

product revenues our business is affected by the increasingly concentrated nature of our semiconductor manufacturer customer base and the cyclicality of the capital equipment procurement practices of those manufacturers, with revenues directly impacted by their investment patterns. our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and, due to the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles, in the preceding periods.
40
product revenues increased by 2% in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013, as our customers increased their investments in defect inspection capabilities to address the yield challenges caused by the introduction of new technologies and architectures, and added production capacity to meet the growing needs for advanced ics demanded in an environment of rising global demand for mobile devices.
product revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2012 as a result of a decline in overall semiconductor industry capital spending. revenue decreases from sales of both our defect inspection and metrology products reflected typical cyclicality in capacity-oriented capital spending by logic and memory chip manufacturers, as well as delays in the procurement of next-generation equipment required to facilitate the transition to extreme ultraviolet lithography.
service revenues service revenues are generated from maintenance contracts, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. the amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers' sites and the utilization of those systems, but it is also impacted by other factors, such as our rate of service contract renewals, the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. service revenues increased sequentially over the fiscal years ended june 30, 2012, 2013 and 2014 as a result of an increase in the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers' sites over that time period.

the following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage:
gross margin percentage fiscal year ended june 30, 2012                         58.1   %
revenue volume of products and services                 (1.9   )%

fiscal year ended june 30, 2013                         56.5   %
revenue volume of products and services                    -   %
mix of products and services sold                       (0.3   )%
manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies           0.2   %
other service and manufacturing costs                    1.5   %
fiscal year ended june 30, 2014                         57.9   %
changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume of products and services reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues. it also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements. changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings. changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements; this includes the impact of capacity utilization, use of overtime and variability of cost structure. changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.
our gross margin increased to 57.9% during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 from 56.5% during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 primarily due to lower charges for inventory obsolescence as well as manufacturing and service efficiencies, partially offset by a less favorable mix of products and services sold.
our gross margin decreased to 56.5% during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 from 58.1% during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2012 primarily due to lower revenue volume, partially offset by a more favorable mix of products and certain manufacturing efficiencies.

our r&d expenses have generally increased over time, including significant increases over the past two fiscal years primarily due to higher costs associated with advanced product and technology development projects. we incur significant costs associated with these projects, including compensation for engineering talent, engineering material costs, and other expenses, as technological innovation is essential to our success. during certain periods, r&d expenses may fluctuate relative to product development phases and project timing.
r&d expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $41.8 million as a result of hiring additional engineering talent and an increase in travel expenses of $2.6 million, as well as a $4.2 million reduction in external funding used to offset the cost of r&d activities.
r&d expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2012, primarily due to the stage and timing of our development projects, as described above. r&d expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 were impacted by an increase in engineering material and depreciation of $26.1 million and an increase in employee-related expenses of $9.0 million as a result of additional engineering headcount.

r&d expenses include the benefit of $8.2 million, $12.4 million and $6.9 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended june 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, for certain strategic development programs, primarily from government grants.
our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. to do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development. we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes.

sg&a expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 were slightly lower compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013, primarily due to lower levels of consulting expenses of $4.5 million and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets of $2.6 million as some intangible assets became fully amortized. this was partially offset by an increase in employee-related expenses of $4.4 million as a result of hiring additional personnel.
sg&a expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2012, primarily due to an increase of $5.7 million in support costs related to product demonstrations and evaluations of our product by customers, as well as depreciation expense, an increase of $3.6 million in travel expenses due to the increasingly global nature of our customers, operations and business, an increase of $2.1 million in employee-related compensation as a result of annual compensation adjustments and additional headcount and $3.1 million in goodwill impairment, severance and other expenses that we recognized during the three months ended september 30, 2012 in connection with our decision to exit from the solar inspection business.

interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio, realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, gains or losses from revaluation of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, impairments associated with equity investments in privately-held companies, and interest related accruals (such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations). the increase in interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 was primarily attributable to an increase of $3.7 million from the sale of an equity investment in a privately-held company, partially offset by an impairment charge of $1.4 million recognized during the three months ended december 31, 2013 related to an equity investment in a privately-held company that was deemed to be other-than-temporary impairment and a decrease in interest income of $1.3 million driven by lower interest rates.
the increase in interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2012 was primarily attributable to a decrease in impairment charges of $2.9 million for equity investments in privately-held companies, an increase in realized gains of marketable securities of $1.2 million and an increase in foreign exchange related gains of $1.9 million, partially offset by an increase of $4.2 million in interest and penalty accruals related to uncertain tax positions.
interest expense is primarily attributable to the $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior fixed rate notes that we issued in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30, 2008.

provision for income taxes the following table provides details of income taxes:

effective tax rate                     20.7   %              21.4   %              22.4   %
the provision for income taxes differs from the statutory u.s. federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates, the tax effects of employee stock activity, tax credits and state taxes.
tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 was 20.7% compared to 21.4% for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013. tax expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in tax reserves and an increase in the percentage of our revenues that were earned outside the u.s. in jurisdictions with lower tax rates, partially offset by a decrease in our research and development credits and an increase in tax expense related to employee stock activity.
tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 was 21.4% compared to 22.4% for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2012. tax expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in the tax effects of employee stock activity, an increase in tax credits and an increase in the domestic manufacturing benefit, offset by an increase in tax reserves.
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, the domestic manufacturing deduction, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our executive deferred savings plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.
we had cumulative windfalls in excess of shortfalls of approximately $23.4 million and $6.9 million during each of the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 and 2013. we incurred $11.9 million in additional tax expense during the fiscal years ended june 30, 2012, due to shortfalls from employee stock activity. windfall tax benefits arise when a company's tax deduction for employee stock activity exceeds book compensation for the same activity. a shortfall arises when the tax deduction is less than book compensation. windfalls are recorded as increases to capital in excess of par value. shortfalls are recorded as decreases to capital in excess of par value to the extent that cumulative windfalls exceed cumulative shortfalls. shortfalls in excess of cumulative windfalls are recorded as provision for income taxes.
for the fiscal year ending june 30, 2015, we do not expect shortfalls from employee stock activity to have an impact on our tax rate, because we do not expect shortfalls to be in excess of cumulative windfalls.
in the normal course of business, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

as of june 30, 2014, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.2 billion, which is an increase of $234 million from june 30, 2013. as of june 30, 2014, $1.3 billion of our $3.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. we currently intend to permanently reinvest $1.1 billion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. if, however, a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the united states, we would be required to accrue and pay u.s. and foreign taxes of approximately 30%-50% of the funds repatriated. the amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated. we have accrued (but have not paid) u.s. taxes on the remaining cash of $152 million of the $1.3 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. as such, these funds can be returned to the u.s. without accruing any additional u.s. tax expense.
the total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended june 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $299 million, $266 million and $234 million, respectively. the increase in the amount of dividends paid during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the preceding fiscal year reflects the increase in the level of our quarterly dividend from $0.40 to $0.45 per share that was instituted during the three months ended september 30, 2013. on july 8, 2014, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a further increase in the level of our quarterly dividend from $0.45 to $0.50 per share.
on july 8, 2014, we also announced that our board of directors had authorized us to repurchase up to 13 million additional shares under our stock repurchase program.
the shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. the decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of employee restricted stock units and in connection with stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.
we have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations.
fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013
net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 from $913 million to $779 million primarily as a result of the following key factors:
•   an increase in payroll of approximately $44 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013,
•   an increase in accounts payable payments of approximately $39 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013,
•   an increase in tax payments of approximately $19 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013, and
•   payments of approximately $15 million upon vesting of cash-based long-term incentive ("cash lti") awards during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 under our cash lti employee compensation plan, whereas no such payments occurred during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013.
45
net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 from $241 million to $676 million, primarily as a result of an increase in the use of cash for purchases of available-for-sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $424 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013. in addition, we acquired a privately-held company for a total purchase consideration of $18 million in cash during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014.
net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 from $429 million to $459 million, primarily as a result of the following key factors:
•   an increase in dividend payments of $33 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013, mainly due to an increase in the quarterly dividend payout amount that we announced in july 2013, and
•   a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $14 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013, partially offset by
•   a decrease in common stock repurchases of $32 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013.
fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012
net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2012 from $942 million to $913 million primarily as a result of the following key factors:
•   an increase in tax payments of approximately $101 million compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2012 due to a change in the timing of when revenue is recognized for federal income tax purposes that resulted in lower tax payments during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2012 and
•   a decrease in cash collections of approximately $61 million primarily due to lower revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2012, partially offset by
•   a decrease in accounts payable payments of approximately $116 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2012.
net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2012 from $529 million to $241 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in the use of cash for purchases of available-for-sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $305 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2012.
net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2012 from $364 million to $429 million, primarily as a result of the following key factors:
•   an increase in dividend payments of $32 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2012, mainly due to an increase in the quarterly dividend payout amount that we announced in july 2012,
•   an increase in common stock repurchases of $9 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2012, and

starting in fiscal year 2013 we adopted a cash-based long-term incentive ("cash lti") program for many of our employees as part of our employee compensation program. cash lti awards issued to employees under the cash long-term incentive plan ("cash lti plan") generally vest in four equal installments, with 25% of the aggregate amount of the cash lti award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a four-year period. in order to receive payments under the cash lti plan, participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date.
we have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. in addition, we periodically sell certain letters of credit ("lcs"), without recourse, received from customers in payment for goods.
the following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of lcs for the indicated periods:

we maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $28.4 million, of which $26.3 million had been issued as of june 30, 2014, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax ("vat") and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in europe and asia.

we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components. our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. this forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately $214.3 million as of june 30, 2014 and are primarily due within the next 12 months. actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. in addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.
we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. the actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; our warranty charge estimates for more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable. non-standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hours per week coverage for 12 months. see note 13, "commitments and contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description.
working capital increased to $3.7 billion as of june 30, 2014, compared to $3.5 billion as of june 30, 2013. this increase is primarily due to higher levels of cash and marketable securities as we generated significant cash flow from operations during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014, as well as a higher level of inventory that resulted from supporting elevated levels of business activity. as of june 30, 2014, our principal source of liquidity consisted of $3.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global and regional economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months.
our credit ratings and outlooks as of june 30, 2014 are summarized below:

off-balance sheet arrangements under our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. this financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. we continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months (see note 16, "derivative instruments and hedging activities" to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description). our outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 18 months, were as follows:

indemnification obligations. subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us. these obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, applicable contracts, and delaware and california law. the obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals' reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters. for example, we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors, officers and employees. although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations generally described in this paragraph is theoretically unlimited, we believe the fair value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings.
we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. typically, these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets, under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from, or provide customers with other remedies to protect against, bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products, non-compliance with our product performance specifications, infringement of third-party intellectual property rights used in our products and a breach of warranties, representations and covenants related to matters such as title to assets sold, validity of certain intellectual property rights, non-infringement of third-party rights, and certain income tax-related matters. in each of these circumstances, payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. this usually allows us to challenge the other party's claims or, in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants, to control the defense or settlement of any third-party claims brought against the other party. further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party), and duration. in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties and/or insurance covering certain payments made by us.
in addition, we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customer-specific pricing, discount, rebate or credit commitments offered by us. furthermore, we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments. if a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights, we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection, as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection. to date, we have made no accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency. while we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments, we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future. one significant customer recently exercised its audit rights, but we cannot predict the outcome of that audit at this time.
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
